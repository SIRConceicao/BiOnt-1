a3560095.s4	One	patient	was	prematurely	discontinued	from	the	study	for	severe	headache	and	abdominal_pain	.	.
a8073369.s9	No	histopathological	alterations	or	differences	in	bone	formation	were	seen	in	the	limbs	or	toes	of	any	chicks	from	any	group	,	however	,	extensive	cranial_hemorrhage	occurred	in	all	nicotine	sulfate	-	treated	chicks	.	.
a20698227.s9	CONCLUSION	,	This	is	the	first	study	in	the	literature	investigating	a	link	between	angiogenesis	soluble	markers	and	ribavirin	induced	anemia	in	patients	with	hepatitis	C	and	we	could	not	find	any	relation	.	.
a10704919.s7	This	was	further	evidenced	by	absence	of	oxygen	consumption	and	hemoglobin	oxidation	both	determined	in	parallel	with	TAM	-	induced	hemolysis	.	.
a7269015.s3	The	similarity	between	the	histologic	appearances	of	busulfan	cystitis	and	both	radiation	and	cyclophosphamide	-	induced	cystitis	is	discussed	and	the	world	literature	reviewed	.	.
a10739826.s7	These	analyses	suggest	that	the	higher	risk	observed	for	the	newer	OC	in	other	studies	may	be	the	result	of	inadequate	comparisons	of	pill	users	with	different	patterns	of	pill	use	.	.
a12695819.s1	Our	objective	was	to	investigate	brain	MR	imaging	findings	and	the	utility	of	diffusion	-	weighted	(	DW	)	imaging	in	organ	transplant	patients	who	developed	neurologic	symptoms	during	tacrolimus	therapy	.	.
a12202650.s1	The	pathophysiology	of	painful	temporomandibular_disorders	is	not	fully	understood	,	but	evidence	suggests	that	muscle_pain	modulates	motor	function	in	characteristic	ways	.	.
a6888657.s9	The	data	extend	the	findings	of	other	investigators	,	further	establishing	the	DES	-	induced	tumor	as	a	model	for	study	of	PRL	cellular	control	mechanisms	.	.
a2348231.s7	Dipyridamole	significantly	increased	coronary	blood	flow	before	and	after	7.5	or	15	mm	/	kg	i.v	.	.
a10342929.s1	The	estimated	incidence	of	angioedema	during	angiotensin	-	converting_enzyme_(ACE)_inhibitor	treatment	is	between	1	and	7	per	thousand	patients	.	.
a3187073.s6	In	the	pre	-	treatment	evaluation	,	signs	of	cardiovascular_disease	were	found	in	33	patients	(	43	%	)	.	.
a10704919.s4	The	extension	of	hemolysis	is	variable	with	erythrocyte	samples	,	but	12.5	microM	TAM	induces	total	hemolysis	of	all	tested	suspensions	.	.
a17854040.s4	HBsAg	,	anti	-	HBs	,	anti	-	HBc	,	and	anti	-	HIV	1/2	were	determined	as	part	of	routine	diagnosis	using	Axsym	assays	(	Abbott	Laboratories	,	North	Chicago	,	IL	)	.	.
a17491223.s3	METHODS	,	The	study	group	comprised	40	patients	undergoing	Sestamibi	-	SPECT	/	dobutamine	stress	test	.	.
a9249847.s0	Iatrogenically	induced	intractable	atrioventricular_reentrant_tachycardia	after	verapamil	and	catheter	ablation	in	a	patient	with	Wolff	-	Parkinson	-	White_syndrome	and	idiopathic_dilated_cardiomyopathy	.	.
a84204.s7	They	should	be	closely	observed	and	should	be	given	reduced	doses	of	cimetidine	.	.
a1728522.s2	This	type	of	lesion	broadens	the	spectrum	of	liver_injury	due	to	this	drug	combination	,	mainly	represented	by	a	benign	cholestatic_syndrome	.	.
a15120741.s2	Population	responses	in	granule	cells	of	the	dentate	gyrus	were	examined	in	transverse	slices	of	the	ventral	hippocampus	from	pilocarpine	-	treated	and	untreated	mice	.	.
a2440413.s2	1981	)	.	.
a16680561.s11	These	data	suggest	that	during	concomitant	treatment	with	cinacalcet	,	dose	adjustment	may	be	necessary	for	drugs	that	demonstrate	a	narrow	therapeutic	index	and	are	metabolized	by	CYP2D6	.	.
a20470218.s2	Outcome	improvement	with	more	intensive	chemotherapy	has	significantly	increased	the	incidence	and	severity	of	adverse	events	.	.
a230316.s11	The	full	syndrome	of	subacute	myelo	-	optic_neuropathy	was	more	frequent	in	women	,	but	they	tended	to	have	taken	greater	quantities	of	the	drug	.	.
a3192036.s4	On	the	first	day	of	the	schedule	,	moderate	high	doses	of	Methotrexate	,	Etoposide	and	Cyclophosphamide	were	administered	.	.
a3341566.s3	During	HEM	-	induced	hypotension	the	cardiac	output	was	significantly	lower	and	systemic	vascular	resistance	higher	compared	with	that	in	the	SNP	group	.	.
a12483326.s2	With	current	treatment	regimens	including	combined	surgery	,	radiation	and	chemotherapy	,	the	average	life	expectancy	of	the	patients	is	limited	to	approximately	1	year	.	.
a7423039.s7	In	the	adriamycin	-	treated	cells	,	the	addition	of	adenosine	increased	the	adenylate	charge	and	,	concomitant	with	this	inrcease	,	the	cells	'	functional	integrity	,	in	terms	of	percentage	of	beating	cells	and	rate	of	contractions	,	was	maintained	.	.
a4071154.s4	Since	nonsteroidal	anti	-	inflammatory	agents	interfere	with	this	compensatory	mechanism	and	may	cause	acute_renal_failure	,	they	should	be	used	with	caution	in	such	patients	.	.
a12695819.s4	Apparent	diffusion	coefficient	(	ADC	)	values	on	the	initial	MR	study	were	correlated	with	reversibility	of	the	lesions	.	.
a6287825.s2	There	is	a	male	preponderance	and	the	peak	incidence	is	in	the	fourth	decade	.	.
a1468485.s3	We	then	used	hyperbaric	oxygen	at	an	absolute	pressure	of	2	atm	,	5	days	a	week	for	8	consecutive	weeks	.	.
a10704919.s2	This	work	evaluates	the	effects	of	TAM	on	isolated	human	erythrocytes	,	attempting	to	identify	the	underlying	mechanisms	on	TAM	-	induced	hemolytic_anemia	and	the	involvement	of	biomembranes	in	its	cytostatic	action	mechanisms	.	.
a2348231.s9	Neither	dose	of	pentoxifylline	significantly	decreased	the	dipyridamole	-	induced	hyperemia	,	while	peak	coronary	blood	flow	was	significantly	lower	after	theophylline	(	p	less	than	0.01	)	.	.
a8690168.s8	Number	and	total	anionic	site	surface	in	the	remaining	part	of	the	glomerular	basement	membrane	(	lamina	densa	and	lamina	rara	interna	)	were	not	significantly	changed	.	.
a12820454.s14	CONCLUSION	,	Our	data	suggest	that	rHuEPO	-	beta	correctable	CAB	-	induced	anemia	occurs	in	14.3	%	of	prostate_cancer	patients	after	6	months	of	therapy	.	.
a17854040.s9	The	HBV	viral	loads	for	mono	-	infected	and	co	-	infected	patients	ranged	from	3.32	x	10(2	)	to	3.82	x	10(7	)	and	<	200	to	4.40	x	10(3	)	copies	/	ml	,	respectively	.	.
a18182964.s5	RESULTS	,	There	were	more	incidents	of	bradycardia	in	subjects	treated	with	clonidine	compared	with	those	not	treated	with	clonidine	(	17.5	%	versus	3.4	%	,	p	=	.02	)	,	but	no	other	significant	group	differences	regarding	electrocardiogram	and	other	cardiovascular	outcomes	.	.
a20470218.s1	Central_nervous_system_(CNS)_complications	during	treatment	of	childhood	acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia	(	ALL	)	remain	a	challenging	clinical	problem	.	.
a2670794.s5	Renal_damage	as	reflected	by	an	increase	in	serum	urea	and	in	kidney	weight	was	prevented	by	Captopril	.	.
a12443032.s0	Cocaine	related	chest_pain	,	are	we	seeing	the	tip	of	an	iceberg	?	.
a6666578.s8	The	endothelial	ultrastructure	was	unaffected	by	D	-	pen	,	and	no	differences	in	aortic	131I	-	HSA	radioactivity	or	aorta	/	serum	-	ratio	were	recorded	between	experimental	and	control	groups	10	minutes	after	tracer	injection	,	indicating	that	the	permeability	of	the	endothelial	barrier	to	albumin	remained	unaffected	by	D	-	pen	treatment	.	.
a17175308.s18	Mean	serum	creatinine	level	before	conversion	was	2.21	mg	/	dL	and	thereafter	,	4.93	mg	/	dL	(	P	=	.02	)	.	.
a11198499.s0	Hypotension	following	the	initiation	of	tizanidine	in	a	patient	treated	with	an	angiotensin	converting	enzyme	inhibitor	for	chronic	hypertension	.	.

a2273650.s2	Similarly	,	pre	-	test	scopolamine	partially	reversed	the	scopolamine	-	induced	amnesia	,	but	not	significantly	,	and	pre	-	test	cycloheximide	failed	to	reverse	the	cycloheximide	-	induced	amnesia	.	.
a2024540.s6	All	patients	recovered	.	.
a12820454.s6	The	duration	of	the	study	was	six	months	.	.
a6287825.s10	Heredofamilial	and	connective_tissue_disorders	were	rare	.	.
a6503301.s1	A	case	of	veno	-	occlusive_disease_of_the_liver	with	fatal	outcome	after	dacarbazine	(	DTIC	)	therapy	for	melanoma	is	reported	.	.
a12615818.s0	The	risk	of	venous_thromboembolism	in	women	prescribed	cyproterone_acetate	in	combination	with	ethinyl_estradiol	,	a	nested	cohort	analysis	and	case	-	control	study	.	.
a10704919.s8	Furthermore	,	it	was	observed	that	TAM	inhibits	the	peroxidation	of	human	erythrocytes	induced	by	AAPH	,	thus	ruling	out	TAM	-	induced	cell	oxidative	stress	.	.
a891050.s1	A	case	is	reported	of	the	hemolytic_uremic_syndrome	(	HUS	)	in	a	woman	taking	oral_contraceptives	.	.
a19300402.s9	Therefore	,	concomitant	administration	of	small	doses	of	bradykinin	receptor	antagonists	and	NO	synthase	inhibitors	can	be	effective	in	alleviation	of	neuropathic_pain	,	even	in	hospital	care	.	.
a17491223.s2	OBJECTIVES	,	To	assess	the	added	diagnostic	value	of	a	new	cardiac	performance	index	(	dP	/	dtejc	)	measurement	,	based	on	brachial	artery	flow	changes	,	as	compared	to	standard	12-lead	ECG	,	for	detecting	dobutamine	-	induced	myocardial_ischemia	,	using	Tc99m	-	Sestamibi	single	-	photon	emission	computed	tomography	as	the	gold	standard	of	comparison	to	assess	the	presence	or	absence	of	ischemia	.	.
a1420741.s11	The	results	of	this	pilot	study	suggest	that	fusidic_acid	may	be	of	benefit	in	selected	chronic	active	Crohn's_disease	patients	in	whom	conventional	treatment	is	ineffective	.	.
a15278670.s5	However	,	the	threshold	(	61.6	+	/-	8.7	mg	.	.
a7423039.s2	Adriamycin	inhibited	cell	growth	and	the	rhythmic	contractions	characteristic	of	myocardial	cells	in	culture	.	.
a2951327.s1	In	six	conscious	,	trained	dogs	,	maintained	on	a	normal	sodium	intake	of	2	to	4	mEq	/	kg	/	day	,	sympathetic	activity	was	assessed	as	the	release	rate	of	norepinephrine	and	epinephrine	during	15-minute	i.v	.	.

a7449470.s0	Late	,	late	doxorubicin	cardiotoxicity	.	.
a3341566.s2	Mean	arterial	pressure	was	decreased	to	50	mm	Hg	for	30	minutes	either	by	hemorrhage	(	HEM	,	n	=	7	)	or	by	continuous	infusion	of	sodium_nitroprusside	(	SNP	,	n	=	7	)	.	.
a17042910.s12	Vascular	eNOS	mRNA	was	assessed	by	semi	-	quantitative	reverse	transcription	-	polymerase	chain	reaction	.	.
a18261172.s6	Proteinuria	increased	significantly	from	a	median	of	0.13	g	/	day	(	range	0	-	5.7	)	preswitch	to	0.23	g	/	day	(	0	-	9.88	)	at	24	months	postswitch	(	p	=	0.0024	)	.	.
a15120741.s5	Focal	glutamate	photostimulation	of	the	granule	cell	layer	at	sites	distant	from	the	recording	pipette	resulted	in	population	responses	of	1	-	30	s	duration	in	slices	from	SE	survivors	but	not	other	groups	.	.
a11897407.s4	99mTc	-	glucarate	was	easy	to	prepare	,	stable	for	96	h	and	was	used	to	study	its	biodistribution	in	rats	with	isoproterenol	-	induced	acute	myocardial_infarction	.	.
a1420741.s7	Five	of	8	patients	(	63	%	)	improved	during	fusidic_acid	treatment	,	3	at	two	weeks	and	2	after	four	weeks	.	.
a18261172.s4	In	this	study	,	long	-	term	cardiac	transplant	patients	were	switched	from	cyclosporine	to	Srl	-	based	IS	.	.
a12090760.s0	Antagonism	between	interleukin	3	and	erythropoietin	in	mice	with	azidothymidine	-	induced	anemia	and	in	bone	marrow	endothelial	cells	.	.
a18503483.s7	Improvement	and	eventually	full	recovery	only	occurred	after	TAC	was	completely	discontinued	and	successfully	replaced	by	everolimus	.	.
a20882060.s3	The	present	study	aimed	to	investigate	the	effects	of	pallidal	neurotensin	on	haloperidol	-	induced	parkinsonian_symptoms	.	.
a9625142.s3	These	responded	to	systemic	steroids	and	immunoglobulins	.	.
a9625142.s1	An	80-yr	-	old	man	developed	acute	hepatitis	shortly	after	ingesting	oral	ceftriaxone	.	.
a7248170.s1	The	yield	of	severe	cirrhosis_of_the_liver	(	defined	as	a	shrunken	finely	nodular	liver	with	micronodular	histology	,	ascites	greater	than	30	ml	,	plasma	albumin	less	than	2.2	g	/	dl	,	splenomegaly	2	-	3	times	normal	,	and	testicular	atrophy	approximately	half	normal	weight	)	after	12	doses	of	carbon_tetrachloride	given	intragastrically	in	the	phenobarbitone	-	primed	rat	was	increased	from	25	%	to	56	%	by	giving	the	initial	"	calibrating	"	dose	of	carbon_tetrachloride	at	the	peak	of	the	phenobarbitone	-	induced	enlargement_of_the_liver	.	.
a16298782.s5	The	otoprotectant_L	-	NAME	was	administered	topically	to	12/27	animals	.	.

a10520387.s1	The	marked	vasodilator	and	negative	inotropic	effects	of	propofol	are	disadvantages	in	frail	elderly	patients	.	.
a18208574.s7	The	Receiver	Operative	Characteristic	Curve	showed	that	OD	>	1.27	in	the	isolated	-	HIT	group	had	a	significantly	higher	chance	of	developing	thrombosis	by	day	30	.	.
a10739826.s4	Totals	of	128	cases	and	650	controls	were	analysed	for	repeat	use	and	135	cases	and	622	controls	for	switching	patterns	.	.
a8302922.s6	EBFF	did	not	change	during	PGE1	infusion	whereas	in	the	TMP	group	,	EBF	decreased	significantly	at	30	and	60	min	after	the	start	of	TMP	(	preinfusion	,	45.9	+	/-	13.9	ml/100g	/	min	.	.
a3173179.s3	We	report	a	case	in	which	myocardial_infarction	coincided	with	the	introduction	of	captopril	and	the	withdrawal	of	verapamil	in	a	previously	asymptomatic	woman	with	severe	hypertension	.	.
a19581773.s6	The	ocular_myasthenia	associated	with	combination	therapy	of	pegylated_IFN_alpha-2b	and	ribavirin	for	CHC	is	very	rarely	reported	,	therefore	,	we	present	this	case	with	a	review	of	the	various	eye	complications	of	IFN	therapy	.	.

a18208574.s6	However	,	OD	was	significantly	higher	in	all	patients	with	thrombosis	(	n	=	48	,	1.34	+	/-	0.89	)	,	including	isolated	-	HIT	patients	who	later	developed	thrombosis	within	30	d	(	n	=	8	,	1.84	+	/-	0.64	)	as	compared	to	isolated	-	HIT	patients	who	did	not	develop	thrombosis	(	0.96	+	/-	0.75	,	P	=	0.011	and	P	=	0.008	)	.	.
a8690168.s5	A	minority	of	anionic	sites	were	scattered	throughout	the	lamina	densa	and	lamina	rara	interna	,	and	were	significantly	smaller	than	those	in	the	lamina	rara	externa	of	the	glomerular	basement	membrane	(	p<0.001	and	p<0.01	for	diabetic	and	control	rats	,	respectively	)	.	.
a4071154.s2	Prompt	restoration	of	renal	function	followed	drug	withdrawal	,	while	re	-	exposure	to	a	single	dose	of	indomethacin	caused	recurrence	of	acute	reversible	oliguria	.	.
a8073369.s10	There	was	a	statistically	significant	(	P	<	or	=	0.01	)	decrease	in	movement	in	coniine	and	nicotine	sulfate	treated	chicks	as	determined	by	ultrasound	.	.
a3192036.s6	Formation	of	these	plugs	was	probably	due	to	extensive	tumor	necrosis	at	the	level	of	the	walls	of	the	major	uterine	veins	,	which	resulted	in	an	open	exchange	of	tumor	plugs	to	the	vascular	spaces	,	decrease	in	tumor	tissue	coherence	secondary	to	chemotherapy	may	have	further	contributed	to	the	formation	of	tumor	emboli	.	.
a3997294.s4	Review	of	this	and	previously	reported	cases	indicates	the	need	for	early	diagnosis	of	amiodarone	pneumonitis	,	immediate	withdrawal	of	amiodarone	,	and	prompt	but	continued	steroid	therapy	to	ensure	full	recovery	.	.
a11679859.s9	One	study	participant	was	excluded	after	protocol	violation	.	.

a18221780.s3	To	this	end	,	persistent	hyperalgesia	was	induced	by	administration	of	capsaicin	in	the	tail	of	gonadally	intact	F344	rats	,	following	which	the	tail	was	immersed	in	a	mildly	noxious	thermal	stimulus	,	and	tail	-	withdrawal	latencies	measured	.	.
a11256525.s8	In	this	patient	,	renal_artery_stenosis	combined	with	heart_failure	and	diuretic	therapy	certainly	resulted	in	a	strong	activation	of	the	renin	-	angiotensin	system	(	RAS	)	.	.
a3341566.s4	The	systemic	,	central	venous	,	pulmonary	capillary	wedge	pressures	,	and	heart	rates	,	were	similar	in	the	two	groups	.	.

a19631624.s8	A	conjunction	analysis	of	the	encode	and	recall	phases	of	the	task	revealed	ecstasy	-	specific	hyperactivity	in	bilateral	frontal	regions	,	left	temporal	,	right	parietal	,	bilateral	temporal	,	and	bilateral	occipital	brain	regions	.	.
a2070391.s2	To	determine	if	the	addition	of	a	buffering	solution	to	adjust	the	pH	of	lidocaine	into	the	physiologic	range	would	reduce	pain	during	injection	,	we	performed	a	blinded	randomized	study	in	patients	undergoing	cardiac	catheterization	.	.
a18261172.s9	Patients	without	proteinuria	had	increased	renal	function	(	median	42.5	vs.	64.1	,	p	=	0.25	)	,	whereas	patients	who	developed	high	-	grade	proteinuria	showed	decreased	renal	function	at	the	end	of	follow	-	up	(	median	39.6	vs.	29.2	,	p	=	0.125	)	.	.
a17466854.s6	A	chi	-	square	test	was	used	to	assess	the	statistical	significance	of	results	.	.
a1639466.s2	Six	weeks	after	clipping	of	one	renal	artery	,	hypertensive	rats	(	178	+	/-	4	mm	Hg	)	were	randomly	assigned	to	three	groups	,	untreated	hypertensive	controls	(	n	=	8)	,	enalapril	-	treated	(	n	=	8)	,	or	nitrendipine	-	treated	(	n	=	10	)	.	.
a2024540.s1	Since	the	introduction	of	angiotensin_converting_enzyme_(ACE)_inhibitors	into	the	adjunctive	treatment	of	patients	with	congestive_heart_failure	,	cases	of	severe	hypotension	,	especially	on	the	first	day	of	treatment	,	have	occasionally	been	reported	.	.
a16298782.s0	Nitro	-	L	-	arginine_methyl_ester	,	a	potential	protector	against	gentamicin	ototoxicity	.	.
a8231633.s0	Effects	of	calcium	channel	blockers	on	bupivacaine	-	induced	toxicity	.	.
a6888657.s1	Pituitary_tumors	were	induced	in	F344	female	rats	by	chronic	treatment	with	diethylstilbestrol	(	DES	,	8	-	10	mg	)	implanted	subcutaneously	in	silastic	capsules	.	.
a10704919.s10	However	,	TAM	induces	release	of	peripheral	proteins	of	membrane	-	cytoskeleton	and	cytosol	proteins	essentially	bound	to	band	3	.	.
a20698227.s10	Future	research	with	larger	number	of	patients	is	needed	to	find	out	modifiable	factors	that	will	improve	the	safety	of	ribavirin	therapy	.	.
a3676049.s8	These	changes	might	offer	protection	to	brain	tissue	during	periods	of	induced	hypotension	.	.
a16160878.s0	Behavioral	effects	of	urotensin	-	II	centrally	administered	in	mice	.	.
a230316.s10	Older	subjects	tended	to	display	more	side	effects	.	.
a12820454.s7	RESULTS	,	The	mean	hemoglobin	(	Hb	)	levels	were	significantly	declined	in	all	patients	from	baseline	of	14.2	g	/	dl	to	14.0	g	/	dl	,	13.5	g	/	dl	,	13.2	g	/	dl	and	12.7	g	/	dl	at	1	,	2	,	3	and	6	months	post	-	CAB	,	respectively	.	.
a2348231.s2	Many	of	these	patients	are	taking	pentoxifylline	(	Trental	)	,	a	methylxanthine	derivative	which	may	improve	intermittent_claudication	.	.
a19631624.s12	These	ecstasy	-	specific	effects	may	be	related	to	the	vulnerability	of	isocortical	and	allocortical	regions	to	the	neurotoxic	effects	of	ecstasy	.	.
a11679859.s11	In	the	bolus	group	,	26.0	%	(	13/50	)	had	akathisia	compared	with	32.7	%	(	16/49	)	in	the	infusion	group	(	Delta=-6.7	%	,	95	%	confidence	interval	[	CI	]	-24.6	%	to	11.2	%	)	.	.
a9334596.s14	Prolactin	exceeded	20	ng./ml	.	.
a9334596.s11	Two	pituitary_tumors	were	discovered	after	testosterone	determination	.	.
a19300402.s2	METHODS	,	The	changes	in	pain	thresholds	were	determined	using	mechanical	stimuli	--	the	modification	of	the	classic	paw	withdrawal	test	described	by	Randall	-	Selitto	.	.
a10807237.s10	Hunt	and	Hess	grade	(	P	<	0.005	)	and	age	(	P	<	0.007	)	were	significant	predictors	of	outcome	for	the	patients	with	cocaine	-	related	aneurysms	.	.
a11391224.s3	METHODS	,	We	examined	278	consecutive	renal	specimens	(	from	135	transplants	and	143	native	kidneys	)	for	ultrastructural	evidence	of	PTCR	.	.
a3693336.s0	Triazolam	-	induced	brief	episodes	of	secondary	mania	in	a	depressed	patient	.	.
a9334596.s8	RESULTS	,	Testosterone	was	less	than	3	ng./ml	.	.
a2440413.s3	In	this	study	,	the	severity	of	response	to	other	seizure	-	inducing	agents	was	tested	in	mice	1	and	24	h	after	intraperitoneal	administration	of	80	mg	/	kg	gamma	-	HCH	.	.
a17466854.s8	CONCLUSIONS	,	The	administration	of	methylprednisolone	and	gentamicin	in	the	posterior	sub	-	Tenon	's	space	was	related	to	a	high	incidence	of	side	effects	including	nausea,_vomiting	,	and	headache	.	.
a3187073.s2	Obviously	,	there	is	a	need	for	effective	chemotherapy	.	.
a12090760.s5	There	was	a	significant	reduction	of	thymidine	incorporation	into	both	erythroid	and	endothelial	cells	in	cultures	pre	-	treated	with	IGF	-	IL-3	and	EPO	.	.
a15278670.s3	l(-1	)	with	lidocaine	infusion	(	6	mg.kg(-1).min(-1	)	)	,	increasing	significantly	to	66.6	+	/-	10.9	mg	.	.
a9334596.s5	Prolactin	results	were	compared	with	those	of	a	previous	personal	cohort	of	1,340	patients	with	erectile_dysfunction	and	systematic	prolactin	determination	.	.
a1639466.s4	After	6	weeks	of	treatment	,	renal	hemodynamics	(	glomerular	filtration	rate	and	renal	plasma	flow	)	were	measured	in	the	anesthetized	rats	.	.
a16181582.s6	The	problems	in	diagnosing	this	condition	are	subsequently	discussed	.	.
a15458908.s0	Safety	and	adverse	effects	associated	with	raloxifene	,	multiple	outcomes	of	raloxifene	evaluation	.	.
a7423039.s6	The	addition	of	1	mM	adenosine	to	the	myocardial	cell	cultures	markedly	increases	the	ATP	concentration	through	a	pathway	reportedly	leading	to	a	compartmentalized	ATP	pool	.	.
a869641.s12	Furthermore	,	the	effects	are	mediated	through	dopamine	rather	than	norepinephrine	and	do	not	require	the	carotid	sinus	baroreceptors	.	.
a2071257.s6	The	findings	of	this	study	indicate	that	the	drug	is	able	to	antagonize	impairment_of_attention_and_memory	induced	by	scopolamine	.	.
a16298782.s3	Their_ototoxicity	is	a	serious	health	problem	and	,	as	their_ototoxic	mechanism	involves	the	production	of	NO	,	we	need	to	assess	the	use	of	NO	inhibitors	for	the	prevention	of_aminoglycoside	-	induced_sensorineural_hearing_loss	.	.
a12596116.s3	The	authors	discuss	the	mechanism	of	the	occurrence	of	this	complication	and	recommend	caution	of	its	use	in	high	-	risk	premature	neonates	.	.
a7468724.s1	Severe	cardiovascular_complications	occurred	in	eight	of	160	patients	treated	with	terbutaline	for	preterm_labor	.	.
a230316.s3	Of	the	remainder	,	a	relationship	to	clioquinol	was	considered	probable	in	42	and	possible	in	69	cases	.	.
a6229975.s3	The	timolol	-	treated	patients	showed	a	small	but	significant	increase	in	heart	size	from	baseline	in	contrast	to	a	decrease	in	the	placebo	group	.	.
a11256525.s9	Under	such	conditions	,	angiotensin_II	receptor	blockade	by	losartan	probably	induced	a	critical	fall	in	glomerular	filtration	pressure	.	.
a11569530.s6	Four	compounds	known	to	increase	QT	interval	and	cause	TDP	were	investigated	,	terfenadine	,	terodiline	,	cisapride	and	E4031	.	.
a11198499.s2	In	addition	to	their	effects	on	spasticity	,	certain	adverse	cardiorespiratory	effects	have	been	reported	.	.
a10739826.s1	The	epidemiological	studies	that	assessed	the	risk	of	venous_thromboembolism	(	VTE	)	associated	with	newer	oral_contraceptives	(	OC	)	did	not	distinguish	between	patterns	of	OC	use	,	namely	first	-	time	users	,	repeaters	and	switchers	.	.
a10807237.s5	Age	at	presentation	,	time	of	ictus	after	intoxication	,	Hunt	and	Hess	grade	of	subarachnoid_hemorrhage	,	size	of	the	aneurysm	,	location	of	the	aneurysm	,	and	the	Glasgow	Outcome	Scale	score	were	assessed	and	compared	.	.
a12820454.s13	Severe	and	clinically	evident	anemia	was	easily	corrected	by	subcutaneous	injections	(	3	times	/	week	for	1	month	)	of	recombinant	erythropoietin	(	rHuEPO	-	beta	)	.	.
a869641.s3	in	anesthetize	MAO	-	inhibited	dogs	.	.

a12483326.s4	Generally	,	carboplatin	is	said	to	have	milder	side	effects	than	cisplatin	,	whose	ocular_and_orbital_toxicity	are	well	known	.	.
a869641.s7	Removal	of	the	carotid	sinuses	caused	an	elevation	blood	pressure	and	heart	rate	and	abolished	the	negative	chronotropic	effect	of	norepinephrine	.	.
a7516729.s8	Independent	but	not	additive	effects	of	Na	and	Ca	are	shown	by	decreases	in	the	values	of	[	verapamil]o	needed	to	reduce	BF	by	30	%	(	IC30	)	with	the	following	order	of	inhibitory	potency	,	LNa	>	LCa	>	HCa	>	N	,	resulting	LNa+HCa	similar	to	LNa	.	.
a15120741.s0	Recurrent	excitation	in	the	dentate	gyrus	of	a	murine	model	of	temporal_lobe_epilepsy	.	.
a15278670.s9	However	,	there	was	no	significant	difference	in	the	lidocaine	concentrations	measured	when	the	systolic	blood	pressure	became	70	mmHg	.	.
a3070035.s2	His	renal	function	remained	impaired	but	stable	during	2	years	'	treatment	with	captopril	but	returned	to	pre	-	treatment	levels	soon	after	cessation	of	the	drug	.	.
a7199841.s5	None	of	the	animals	that	received	bupivacaine	,	normal	saline	,	or	normal	saline	titrated	to	a	pH	3.0	developed	hind	-	limb	paralysis	.	.
a2096243.s5	It	may	be	attributed	to	the	structural_damage_to_the_frontal_lobe	.	.
a2024540.s2	To	assess	the	safety	of	the	ACE_inhibitor	enalapril	a	multicenter	,	randomized	,	prazosin	-	controlled	trial	was	designed	that	compared	the	incidence	and	severity	of	symptomatic	hypotension	on	the	first	day	of	treatment	.	.
a3187073.s4	The	aim	of	the	study	was	to	clarify	the	incidence	and	severity	of	adverse	cardiac	effects	to	this	treatment	.	.
a11027905.s2	Animal	and	clinical	studies	have	suggested	that	N	-	methyl	-	D	-	aspartate	(	NMDA	)	antagonists	,	such	as	ketamine	,	may	be	effective	in	improving	opioid	analgesia	in	difficult	pain	syndromes	,	such	as	neuropathic_pain	.	.
a1639466.s3	Sham	-	operated	rats	served	as	normotensive	controls	(	128	+	/-	3	mm	Hg	,	n	=	8)	.	.
a17242861.s7	B6	mice	were	resistant	to	seizures	and	slower	to	reach	stages	compared	to	A	/	J	mice	.	.
a10807237.s3	METHODS	,	A	review	of	admissions	during	a	6-year	period	revealed	14	patients	with	cocaine	-	related	aneurysms	.	.
a1436384.s8	Depletion	of	dopamine	in	the	striatum	was	also	antagonized	when	LY274614	was	given	after	the	injection	of	amphetamine	,	LY274614	protected	when	given	up	to	4	hr	after	but	not	when	given	8	or	24	hr	after	amphetamine	.	.
a2670794.s7	It	is	suggested	that	the	effects	of	Captopril	on	the	lungs	may	be	attributable	to	a	vasodilatory	effect	due	to	a	reduction	in	the	circulating	level	of	Angiotension_II	and	an	increase	in	prostacyclin	(	secondary	to	an	increase	in	bradykinin	)	.	.
a10807237.s11	CONCLUSION	,	Cocaine	use	predisposed	aneurysmal_rupture	at	a	significantly	earlier	age	and	in	much	smaller	aneurysms	.	.
a18208574.s9	Multivariate	analysis	showed	a	2.8-fold	increased	risk	of	thrombosis	in	females	.	.
a9334596.s4	Determination	was	repeated	in	case	of	abnormal	first	results	.	.

a18182964.s9	CONCLUSIONS	,	Clonidine	,	used	alone	or	with	methylphenidate	,	appears	safe	and	well	tolerated	in	childhood	ADHD	.	.
a1732369.s5	Echocardiographic	Doppler	studies	were	performed	before	infusion	and	after	15	min	of	infusion	at	each	rate	.	.
a11256525.s2	He	was	hospitalized	for	a	myocardial_infarction	with	pulmonary_edema	,	treated	with	high	-	dose	diuretics	.	.
a20698227.s5	RESULTS	,	We	observed	a	significant	decrease	in	haptoglobin	levels	at	the	end	of	the	treatment	period	.	.
a18261172.s10	Thus	,	proteinuria	may	develop	in	cardiac	transplant	patients	after	switch	to	Srl	,	which	may	have	an	adverse	effect	on	renal	function	in	these	patients	.	.
a15278670.s1	The	influence	of	sevoflurane	on	lidocaine	-	induced	convulsions	was	studied	in	cats	.	.

a8690168.s4	The	majority	of	anionic	sites	(	74	%	in	diabetic	and	81	%	in	control	rats	)	were	found	within	the	lamina	rara	externa	of	the	glomerular	basement	membrane	.	.
a435349.s1	Suxamethonium_chloride	(	Sch	)	was	administered	i.v	.	.
a19631624.s9	Ecstasy	-	specific	hypoactivity	was	evident	in	the	right	dorsal	anterior	cingulated	cortex	(	ACC	)	and	left	posterior	cingulated	cortex	.	.
a19300402.s4	Pretreatment	with	L	-	NOArg	and	L	-	NIL	but	not	7-NI	,	significantly	increases	antihyperalgesic	activity	both	HOE_140	and	des_Arg10_HOE_140	.	.
a18996674.s3	The	management	options	in	the	ED	,	as	exemplified	by	four	individual	case	reports	,	in	particular	the	use	of	a	minimally	invasive	method	of	intracorporal	epinephrine	instillation	,	are	discussed	.	.
a6503301.s4	Small-	and	medium	-	sized	hepatic	veins	were	blocked	by	thrombosis	.	.
a17491223.s7	dP	/	dtejc	outcome	was	combined	with	the	ECG	results	,	giving	an	ECG	-	enhanced	value	,	and	compared	to	ECG	alone	.	.
a1436384.s9	The	prolonged	depletion	of	dopamine	in	the	striatum	in	mice	,	given	multiple	injections	of	methamphetamine	,	was	also	antagonized	dose	-	dependently	and	completely	by	LY274614	.	.
a1987816.s1	OBJECTIVE	,	This	study	was	designed	to	determine	whether	patients	maintained	on	a	regimen	of	lithium	on	a	once	-	per	-	day	schedule	have	lower	urine	volumes	than	do	patients	receiving	multiple	doses	per	day	.	.
a17854040.s6	HBV	viral	load	was	performed	with	Amplicor	HBV	Monitor	test	v2.0	(	Roche	Diagnostics	,	Penzberg	,	Germany	)	.	.
a3412544.s2	The	risk	of	renal_papillary_necrosis	was	increased	nearly	20-fold	by	consumption	of	phenacetin	,	which	also	increased	the	risk	for	cancer_of_the_renal_pelvis_and_bladder	but	not	for	ureteric_cancer	.	.
a15458908.s1	OBJECTIVE	,	To	examine	the	effect	of	raloxifene	on	major	adverse	events	that	occur	with	postmenopausal	estrogen	therapy	or	tamoxifen	.	.

a19300402.s3	RESULTS	,	The	results	of	this	paper	confirm	that	inhibition	of	bradykinin	receptors	and	inducible	NO	synthase	but	not	neuronal	NO	synthase	activity	reduces	diabetic_hyperalgesia	.	.
a84204.s5	The	cerebrospinal	fluid	,	serum	ratio	of	cimetidine	concentrations	was	0.24,1	and	indicates	that	cimetidine	passes	the	blood	-	brain	barrier	,	it	also	raises	the	possibility	that	M.S.	changes	are	due	to	blockade	of	histamine	H2-receptors	in	the	central	nervous	system	.	.
a12820454.s3	All	patients	received	CAB	[	leuprolide_acetate	(	LHRH	-	A	)	3.75	mg	,	intramuscularly	,	every	28	days	plus	250	mg	flutamide	,	tid	,	per	Os	]	and	were	evaluated	for	anemia	by	physical	examination	and	laboratory	tests	at	baseline	and	4	subsequent	intervals	(	1	,	2	,	3	and	6	months	post	-	CAB	)	.	.
a6229975.s1	The	effect	of	long	-	term	timolol	treatment	on	heart	size	after	myocardial_infarction	was	evaluated	by	X	-	ray	in	a	double	-	blind	study	including	241	patients	(	placebo	126	,	timolol	115	)	.	.

a17175308.s8	Before	conversion	8	(	32	%	)	patients	had	no	proteinuria	,	whereas	afterwards	all	patients	had	proteinuria	.	.
a9334596.s23	However	,	cost	-	effective	screening	strategies	recommended	so	far	missed	40	to	50	%	of	cases	improved	with	endocrine	therapy	and	the_pituitary_tumors	.	.
a2070391.s4	The	mean	pain	score	for	buffered	lidocaine	was	significantly	lower	than	the	mean	score	for	standard	lidocaine	(	2.7	+	/-	1.9	vs.	3.8	+	/-	2.2	,	P	=	0.03	)	.	.
a7053303.s3	The	extrapolated	6-hr	serum	concentration	of	cimetidine	per	unit	dose	,	after	intravenous	cimetidine	,	increased	with	age	of	the	patients	.	.
a8421099.s4	In	8	patients	followed	for	24	weeks	,	gallbladder	contractility	remained	depressed	throughout	therapy	.	.
a11198499.s3	Adults	chronically	treated	with	angiotensin	converting	enzyme	inhibitors	may	have	a	limited	ability	to	respond	to	hypotension	when	the	sympathetic	response	is	simultaneously	blocked	.	.
a12907309.s8	Neuroprotection	rendered	by	MPEP	may	be	associated	with	the	reduction	of	the	methamphetamine	-	induced	dopamine	efflux	in	the	striatum	due	to	the	blockade	of	extrastriatal	mGluR5	,	and	with	a	decrease	in	hyperthermia	.	.
a17242861.s5	Three	hundred	fifty	-	five	adult	male	CSS	mice	,	58	B6	,	and	39	A	/	J	were	tested	for	susceptibility	to	pilocarpine	-	induced	seizures	.	.
a10704919.s6	The	hemolytic	effect	of	TAM	is	prevented	by	low	concentrations	of	alpha	-	tocopherol	(	alpha	-	T	)	and	alpha	-	tocopherol_acetate	(	alpha	-	TAc	)	(	inactivated	functional	hydroxyl	)	indicating	that	TAM	-	induced	hemolysis	is	not	related	to	oxidative	membrane	damage	.	.
a3187073.s12	It	is	concluded	that	patients	on	5-FU	treatment	should	be	under	close	supervision	and	that	the	treatment	should	be	discontinued	if	chest_pain	or	tachyarrhythmia	is	observed	.	.
a2670794.s1	Induction	of	intravascular_coagulation	and	inhibition	of	fibrinolysis	by	injection	of	thrombin	and	tranexamic_acid	(	AMCA	)	in	the	rat	gives	rise	to	pulmonary_and_renal_insufficiency	resembling	that	occurring	after	trauma	or	sepsis	in	man	.	.
a18208574.s0	Higher	optical	density	of	an	antigen	assay	predicts	thrombosis	in	patients	with	heparin	-	induced	thrombocytopenia	.	.
a6308277.s2	Because	salicylates	have	been	reported	to	augment	the	stimulatory	effects	of	caffeine	on	the	CNS	,	attention	was	focused	on	the	possibility	that	the	presence	of	acetaminophen	(	52	micrograms	/	mL	)	reduced	the	CNS	toxicity	of	caffeine	.	.
a2008831.s3	In	all	patients	with	variant_angina	,	coronary_spasm	was	provoked	at	a	mean	dose	of	28	+	/-	13	micrograms	(	mean	+	/-	SD	)	.	.
a19581773.s3	A	brain	imaging	study	and	repetitive	nerve	stimulation	test	indicated	no	abnormality	.	.
a11256525.s3	Due	to	severe	systolic_dysfunction	losartan	was	prescribed	.	.
a15632880.s8	Patients	who	developed	hyperkalemia	were	older	and	more	likely	to	have	diabetes	,	had	higher	baseline	serum	potassium	levels	and	lower	baseline	potassium	supplement	doses	,	and	were	more	likely	to	be	treated	with	beta	-	blockers	than	controls	(	n	=	134	)	.	.
a11569530.s4	2	.	.
a9249847.s1	In	a	patient	with	WPW_syndrome	and	idiopathic_dilated_cardiomyopathy	,	intractable	atrioventricular_reentrant_tachycardia	(	AVRT	)	was	iatrogenically	induced	.	.
a17491223.s0	Assessment	of	a	new	non	-	invasive	index	of	cardiac	performance	for	detection	of	dobutamine	-	induced	myocardial_ischemia	.	.
a3676049.s7	There	was	a	significant	increase	in	CBF	,	although	CMRO2	was	unchanged	,	compared	with	pre	-	hypotensive	values	.	.
a9653867.s4	In	particular	it	illustrates	the	derangements	of	thyroid	function	seen	in	pregnant	women	with	eating_disorders	and	reminds	us	that	when	a	cause	for	thyrotoxicosis	remains	obscure	,	thyroxine	abuse	should	be	considered	and	explored	.	.
a11256525.s7	Ultimately	,	an	arteriography	showed	a	70	-	80	%	renal_artery_stenosis	.	.
a3358181.s5	Careful	fluid	administration	and	cautious	use	of	titrated	doses	of	ephedrine	are	advised	.	.
a18503483.s1	TAC	has	been	shown	to	be	a	potent	immunosuppressive	agent	for	solid	organ	transplantation	in	pediatrics	.	.
a11897407.s2	The	animal	model	used	to	produce	infarction	implies	artery	ligation	but	chemical	induction	can	be	easily	obtained	with	isoproterenol	.	.
a18081909.s6	OUTCOME	,	Following	discontinuation	of	LEV	,	EEG	and	neuropsychological	findings	improved	and	seizure	frequency	decreased	.	.
a18081909.s2	FINDINGS	,	A	28-year	-	old	man	suffering	from	idiopathic_epilepsy	with	generalized	seizures	was	treated	with	LEV	(	3000	mg	)	added	to	valproate	(	VPA	)	(	2000	mg	)	.	.
a19581773.s5	The	patient	's	ophthalmological	symptoms	improved	rapidly	3	weeks	after	discontinuation	of	pegylated_IFN_alpha-2b	and	ribavirin	.	.
a2071257.s1	The	present	study	was	carried	out	to	test	the	effects	of	L	-	alpha	-	glycerylphosphorylcholine	(	L	-	alpha	-	GFC	)	on	memory_impairment	induced	by	scopolamine	in	man	.	.
a15458908.s9	CONCLUSION	,	Raloxifene	was	associated	with	an	increased	risk	for	venous_thromboembolism	,	but	there	was	no	increased	risk	for	cataracts	,	gallbladder_disease	,	endometrial_hyperplasia	,	or	endometrial_cancer	.	.
a3192036.s1	Multiple	cytotoxic	drug	administration	is	the	generally	accepted	treatment	of	patients	with	a	high	-	risk	stage	of	choriocarcinoma	.	.
a15632880.s10	CONCLUSIONS	,	Spironolactone	-	induced	hyperkalemia	and	renal_insufficiency	are	more	common	in	our	clinical	experience	than	reported	previously	.	.
a6634932.s1	UM-272	(	N	,	N	-	dimethylpropranolol	)	,	a	quaternary	antiarrhythmic	agent	,	was	administered	sublingually	to	dogs	with	ouabain	-	induced	ventricular_tachycardias	.	.
a16680561.s1	OBJECTIVE	,	In	vitro	work	has	demonstrated	that	cinacalcet	is	a	strong	inhibitor	of	cytochrome	P450	isoenzyme	(	CYP	)	2D6	.	.
a11391224.s10	PTCR	also	occurs	in	certain	native	kidney_diseases	,	though	the	association	is	not	as	strong	as	that	for	TG	.	.
a7516729.s4	It	decreased	by	16	+	/-	3	%	by	lowering	[	Na]o	to	78	mM	(	LNa	)	,	23	+	/-	2	%	by	lowering	simultaneously	[	Na]o	to	78	mM	and	[	Ca]o	to	0.675	mM	(	LNa+LCa	)	and	31	+	/-	5	%	by	lowering	[	Na]o	to	78	mM	plus	increasing	[	Ca]o	to	3.6	mM	(	LNa+HCa	)	.	.
a3192036.s7	In	view	of	the	close	time	association	between	the	start	of	chemotherapy	and	the	acute	onset	of	massive	embolism	other	explanations	,	such	as	spontaneous	necrosis	,	must	be	considered	less	likely	.	.
a18182964.s7	Moderate	or	severe	adverse	events	were	more	common	in	subjects	on	clonidine	(	79.4	%	versus	49.2	%	,	p	=	.0006	)	but	not	associated	with	higher	rates	of	early	study	withdrawal	.	.
a2673163.s5	Cerebral_infarction	occurred	in	10	patients	(	22	%	)	,	intracerebral_hemorrhage	in	22	(	49	%	)	,	and	subarachnoid_hemorrhage	in	13	(	29	%	)	.	.
a16680561.s4	Blood	samples	were	obtained	predose	and	up	to	72	h	postdose	.	.
a435349.s4	Six	additional	patients	received	a	30-mg	i.v	.	.
a17175308.s10	In	40	%	it	increased	by	more	than	100	%	.	.
a12202650.s0	Capsaicin	-	induced	muscle_pain	alters	the	excitability	of	the	human	jaw	-	stretch	reflex	.	.
a11166519.s0	Acute	cocaine	-	induced	seizures	,	differential	sensitivity	of	six	inbred	mouse	strains	.	.
a3750012.s2	Although	acetylcholine	receptor	antibodies	were	not	detectable	,	the	time	course	was	consistent	with	an	autoimmune	process	.	.
a17042910.s3	Atorvastatin	(	Ato	)	possesses	pleiotropic	properties	that	have	been	reported	to	improve	endothelial	function	through	increased	availability	of	NO	and	reduced	O2-	production	in	various	forms	of	hypertension	.	.
a17466854.s3	METHODS	,	A	double	-	blind	double	-	armed	prospective	study	comprised	40	patients	who	had	uneventful	sutureless	phacoemulsification	under	sub	-	Tenon	's	local	infiltration	of	3	mL	of	plain	lignocaine	.	.
a18343374.s7	RESULT(S	)	,	A	36-year	-	old	Chinese	woman	developed	central	retinal_vein_occlusion	after	eight	courses	of	CC	.	.
a6387529.s3	Delayed_free_recall_was_also_impaired	but	the	two	drugs	did	not	differ	.	.
a3782049.s0	A	case	of	massive	rhabdomyolysis	following	molindone	administration	.	.
a16160878.s2	Intracerebroventricular	(	i.c.v	.	)	.
a20621845.s0	Elevation	of	ADAM10	,	ADAM17	,	MMP-2	and	MMP-9	expression	with	media	degeneration	features	CaCl2-induced	thoracic_aortic_aneurysm	in	a	rat	model	.	.
a10342929.s2	This	potentially	serious	adverse	effect	is	often	preceded	by	minor	manifestations	that	may	serve	as	a	warning	.	.
a17242861.s6	Highest	stage	reached	and	latency	to	each	stage	were	recorded	for	all	mice	.	.
a10807237.s2	However	,	no	study	in	the	literature	has	reported	the	use	of	a	statistical	model	to	analyze	the	variables	that	influence	outcome	.	.
a7516729.s1	The	effects	of	varying	the	extracellular	concentrations	of	Na	and	Ca	(	[	Na]o	and	[	Ca]o	)	on	both	,	the	spontaneous	beating	and	the	negative	chronotropic	action	of	verapamil	,	were	studied	in	the	isolated	rat	atria	.	.
a17042910.s5	Ato	could	prevent	endothelial	NO	synthase	(	eNOS	)	downregulation	and	the	increase	in	O2-	in	Sprague	-	Dawley	(	SD	)	rats	,	thereby	reducing	blood	pressure	.	.
a17175308.s12	Biopsies	performed	in	five	patients	revealed	new	pathological	changes	,	One	membranoproliferative_glomerulopathy	and	interstitial_nephritis	.	.
a7453952.s4	At	12	h	,	all	the	tissues	showed	a	slight	increase	in	lithium	levels	.	.
a869641.s4	In	addition	,	reflex	bradycardia	caused	by	injected	norepinephrine	was	significantly	enhanced	by	L	-	dopa	,	DL	-	Threo	-	dihydroxyphenylserine	had	no	effect	on	blood	pressure	,	heart	rate	or	reflex	responses	to	norepinephrine	.	.
a10739826.s5	The	adjusted	rate	ratio	of	VTE	for	repeat	users	of	third	generation	OC	was	0.6	(	95	%	CI,0.3	-	1.2	)	relative	to	repeat	users	of	second	generation	pills	,	whereas	it	was	1.3	(	95	%	CI,0.7	-	2.4	)	for	switchers	from	second	to	third	generation	pills	relative	to	switchers	from	third	to	second	generation	pills	.	.
a11027905.s6	This	effect	was	more	relevant	in	patients	treated	with	higher	doses	.	.
a1786266.s3	Repeated	cerebral	perfusion	SPECT	scans	revealed	decreased_basal_ganglia_perfusion	while	the	movement_disorder	was	present	,	and	a	return	to	normal	perfusion	when	the	rabbit_syndrome	resolved	.	.
a10704919.s15	Additionally	,	since	membrane	leakage	is	a	final	stage	of	cytotoxicity	,	the	disruption	of	the	structural	characteristics	of	biomembranes	by	TAM	may	contribute	to	the	multiple	mechanisms	of	its	anticancer	action	.	.
a8669433.s1	Six	epidemiologic	studies	in	the	United	States	and	Europe	indicate	that	habitual	use	of	phenacetin	is	associated	with	the	development	of	chronic_renal_failure	and	end	-	stage_renal_disease	(	ESRD	)	,	with	a	relative	risk	in	the	range	of	4	to	19	.	.
a6634932.s3	Sublingual	UM-272	converted	ventricular_tachycardia	to	sinus	rhythm	in	all	5	dogs	.	.
a18208574.s2	PATIENTS	AND	METHODS	,	Patients	with	more	than	50	%	decrease	in	platelet	count	or	thrombocytopenia	(	<	150	x	10(9)/L	)	after	exposure	to	heparin	,	who	had	a	positive	two	-	step	antigen	assay	[	optical	density	(	OD	)	>	0.4	and	>	50	inhibition	with	high	concentration	of	heparin	]	were	included	in	the	study	.	.
a2670794.s6	The	amount	of	fibrin	in	the	kidneys	was	also	considerably	lower	than	in	animals	which	received	thrombin	and	AMCA	alone	.	.
a10739826.s2	Data	from	a	Transnational	case	-	control	study	were	used	to	assess	the	risk	of	VTE	for	the	latter	patterns	of	use	,	while	accounting	for	duration	of	use	.	.
a11897407.s8	ROIs	drawn	over	the	gamma	camera	images	showed	a	ratio	of	4.4	.	.
a7053303.s6	There	was	only	one	case	of	dementia	possibly	due	to	cimetidine	(	with	a	drug	level	of	1.9	microgram	/	ml	6	hr	after	a	dose	)	in	a	group	of	13	patients	without	liver_or_kidney_disease	who	had	cimetidine	levels	above	1.25	microgram	/	ml	.	.
a10704919.s14	These	defects	explain	the	abnormal	erythrocyte	shape	and	decreased	mechanical	stability	promoted	by	TAM	,	resulting	in	hemolytic_anemia	.	.
a1420741.s8	There	were	no	serious	clinical	side	effects	,	but	dose	reduction	was	required	in	two	patients	because	of	nausea	.	.
a11027905.s3	A	slow	bolus	of	subhypnotic	doses	of	ketamine	(	0.25	mg	/	kg	or	0.50	mg	/	kg	)	was	given	to	10	cancer	patients	whose	pain	was	unrelieved	by	morphine	in	a	randomized	,	double	-	blind	,	crossover	,	double	-	dose	study	.	.
a230316.s2	In	80	cases	insufficient	information	was	available	for	adequate	comment	and	in	29	a	relationship	to	the	administration	of	clioquinol	could	be	excluded	.	.
a17491223.s8	RESULTS	,	The	sensitivity	improved	dramatically	from	16	%	to	79	%	,	positive	predictive	value	increased	from	60	%	to	68	%	and	negative	predictive	value	from	54	%	to	78	%	,	and	specificity	decreased	from	90	%	to	67	%	.	.
a3693336.s3	Manic	excitement	was	coincident	with	the	duration	of	action	of	triazolam	.	.
a1732369.s6	Dobutamine	infusion	at	10	micrograms	/	kg	per	min	was	discontinued	after	six	studies	secondary	to	a	50	%	incidence	rate	of	adverse	symptoms	.	.
a7862923.s4	The	results	of	this	case	report	support	the	idea	that	in	contrast	with	carbamazepine	oxcarbazepine	does	not	induce	the	hepatic	microsomal	enzyme	systems	regulating	the	inactivation	of	antipsychotic	drugs	.	.
a15632880.s0	Spironolactone	-	induced	renal_insufficiency	and	hyperkalemia	in	patients	with	heart_failure	.	.
a20470218.s4	Exclusion	criteria	included	CNS	leukemic_infiltration	at	diagnosis	,	therapy	-	related	peripheral_neuropathy	,	late	-	onset	encephalopathy	,	or	long	-	term	neurocognitive_defects	.	.
a1987816.s5	The	dosing	schedule	,	duration	of	lithium	treatment	,	and	daily	dose	of	lithium	did	not	affect	maximum	osmolality	or	creatinine	clearance	.	.
a1420741.s6	The	disease	activity	was	primarily	measured	by	a	modified	individual	grading	score	.	.
a11679859.s10	Seventy	-	three	percent	(	73/99	)	of	the	study	participants	were	treated	for	headache	and	70	%	(	70/99	)	for	nausea	.	.
a10520387.s4	The	addition	of	ephedrine	to	propofol	appears	to	be	an	effective	method	of	obtunding	the	hypotensive	response	to	propofol	at	all	doses	used	in	this	study	.	.
a84204.s3	These	6	patients	had	both	renal_and_liver_dysfunction	(	P	less	than	0.05	)	,	as	well	as	cimetidine	trough	-	concentrations	of	more	than	1.25	microgram	/	ml	(	P	less	than	0.05	)	.	.
a6133211.s1	Three	infants	,	born	of	two	mothers	with	inflammatory_bowel_disease	who	received	treatment	with	sulphasalazine	throughout	pregnancy	,	were	found	to	have	major	congenital_anomalies	.	.
a12090760.s6	Endothelial	cell	culture	supernatants	separated	by	ultrafiltration	and	ultracentrifugation	from	cells	treated	with	EPO	and	IL-3	significantly	reduced	thymidine	incorporation	into	erythroid	cells	as	compared	to	identical	fractions	obtained	from	the	media	of	cells	cultured	with	EPO	alone	.	.
a1468485.s6	In	future	,	this	form	of	therapy	can	offer	a	safe	alternative	in	the	treatment	of	cyclophosphamide	-	induced	hemorrhagic_cystitis	.	.
a16298782.s4	In	this	experimental	study	we	used	30	Sprague	-	Dawley	rats	,	27	of	which	had_gentamicin	instilled	into	the	middle	ear	.	.
a11166519.s5	DBA/2J	,	BALB	/	cByJ	and	NZW	/	LacJ	strains	exhibited	intermediate	sensitivity	.	.
a3750012.s0	Myasthenia_gravis	caused	by	penicillamine	and	chloroquine	therapy	for	rheumatoid_arthritis	.	.
a1992636.s2	It	has	been	shown	to	be	extremely	effective	in	the	treatment	of	peptic_ulcer_disease	,	reflux_esophagitis	,	and	the	Zollinger	-	Ellison_syndrome	.	.
a1436384.s0	Protection	against	amphetamine	-	induced	neurotoxicity	toward	striatal	dopamine	neurons	in	rodents	by	LY274614	,	an	excitatory	amino_acid	antagonist	.	.
a15957009.s11	In	conclusion	,	although	Ro4368554	did	not	improve	a	time	-	related	retention	deficit	,	it	reversed	a	cholinergic	and	a	serotonergic	memory_deficit	,	suggesting	that	both	mechanisms	may	be	involved	in	the	facilitation	of	object	memory	by	Ro4368554	and	,	possibly	,	other	5-HT(6	)	receptor	antagonists	.	.
a3358181.s3	Preoperative	assessment	should	focus	on	cardiovascular	status	and	serum	potassium	level	.	.
a17042910.s0	Anti	-	oxidant	effects	of	atorvastatin	in	dexamethasone	-	induced	hypertension	in	the	rat	.	.
a18343374.s5	INTERVENTION(S	)	,	Ophthalmic	examination	after	CC	therapy	.	.
a567256.s2	Angiosarcoma	was	also	present	within	pulmonary	and	renal	arteries	.	.
a2887062.s3	Electron	microscopy	disclosed	many	secretory	granules	,	slightly	distorted	rough	endoplasmic	reticulum	,	and	partially	dilated	Golgi	cisternae	in	the	prolactinoma	cells	.	.
a20470218.s7	In	conclusion	,	CNS	complications	are	frequent	events	during	ALL	therapy	,	and	require	rapid	detection	and	prompt	treatment	to	limit	permanent	damage	.	.
a9293063.s1	We	report	a	case	of	bile_duct_hamartoma	which	developed	in	a	patient	who	had	been	on	long	-	term	danazol	treatment	.	.
a17466854.s7	RESULTS	,	Sixty	percent	in	Group	A	developed	postoperative_emetic_symptoms	,	headache	,	or	both	,	1	patient	in	Group	B	developed	symptoms	.	.
a17854040.s10	It	remains	to	be	seen	whether	such	pre	-	existing	antiviral	mutations	could	result	in	widespread	emergence	of	HBV	resistant	strains	when	lamivudine	-	containing	highly	active	antiretroviral	(	ARV	)	treatment	(	HAART	)	regimens	become	widely	applied	in	South	Africa	,	as	this	is	likely	to	have	potential	implications	in	the	management	of	HBV	-	HIV_co	-	infected	patients	.	.
a20698227.s4	Serum	hemoglobin	,	haptoglobin	and	angiogenesis	markers	of	vascular	endothelial	growth	factor	and	angiopoetin-2	were	investigated	before	and	after	therapy	.	.
a15278670.s11	Apamin	(	10	ng	)	had	a	tendency	to	decrease	the	convulsive	threshold	(	21.6	+	/-	2.2	to	19.9	+	/-	2.5	mg	.	.

a15957009.s3	The	present	study	sought	to	characterize	the	cognitive	-	enhancing	effects	of	the	5-HT(6	)	antagonist	Ro4368554	(	3-benzenesulfonyl-7-(4-methyl	-	piperazin-1-yl)1H	-	indole	)	in	a	rat	object	recognition	task	employing	a	cholinergic	(	scopolamine	pretreatment	)	and	a	serotonergic-	(	tryptophan	(	TRP	)	depletion	)	deficient	model	,	and	compared	its	pattern	of	action	with	that	of	the	acetylcholinesterase	inhibitor	metrifonate	.	.
a8669433.s8	The	possibility	that	habitual	use	of	acetaminophen	alone	increases	the	risk	of	ESRD	has	not	been	clearly	demonstrated	,	but	can	not	be	dismissed	.	.
a9523805.s10	Times	to	ambulate	and	to	void	were	similar	after	lidocaine	and	prilocaine	(	150	vs.	165	min	and	238	vs.	253	min	,	respectively	)	but	prolonged	after	bupivacaine	(	200	and	299	min	,	respectively	,	P	<	0.05	)	.	.
a19356307.s4	Simultaneously	,	we	found	that	these	two	lemon	essential	oil	components	could	inhibit	acetylcholinesterase	activity	in	vitro	using	the	Ellman	method	.	.
a6692345.s5	The	present	results	are	consistent	with	the	carcinogenicity	experiment	suggesting	that	different	mechanisms	are	involved	in	FANFT	carcinogenesis	in	the	bladder	and	forestomach	,	and	that	aspirin	's	effect	on	FANFT	in	the	forestomach	is	not	due	to	an	irritant	effect	associated	with	increased	cell	proliferation	.	.

a7199841.s2	The	possible	role	of	low	pH	as	well	as	total	volume	as	potential	factors	in	causing	neurotoxicity	was	evaluated	.	.
a12627929.s8	CONCLUSION	,	The	addition	of	thalidomide	to	docetaxel	in	the	treatment	of	prostate_cancer	significantly	increases	the	frequency	of	VTE	.	.
a9034419.s6	Based	on	nonoverdose	pharmacokinetics	and	pharmacodynamics	of	venlafaxine	and	the	potential	risks	of	available	interventions	,	no	emergent	therapy	was	instituted	.	.
a3676049.s5	This	resulted	in	a	significant	decrease	in	CMRO2	(	to	1.73	+	/-	0.16	ml/100	g	min-1	)	,	while	CBF	was	unchanged	.	.

a6308277.s4	The	frequency	of	sound	-	induced	seizures	after	12.5	or	25	mg	/	kg	caffeine	was	reduced	from	50	to	5	%	by	acetaminophen	.	.
a12820454.s4	Hb	,	PSA	and	Testosterone	measurements	were	recorded	.	.
a6103707.s11	The	drug	was	still	present	in	measurable	quantities	after	24	h	even	with	the	smallest	dose	.	.
a2670794.s3	The	lung	weights	were	lower	and	PaO2	was	improved	in	rats	given	this	enzyme	-	blocking	agent	.	.

a8073369.s7	All	concentrations	of	nicotine	sulfate	caused	some	lethality	but	a	no	effect	level	for	coniine	lethality	was	0.75	%	.	.
a6503301.s5	Eosinophilic	infiltrations	were	found	around	the	vessels	.	.
a3714122.s3	These	data	were	correlated	with	histologically	scored	cervical	cord_damage	in	a	separate	group	of	similarly	dosed	rats	sampled	14	-	21	days	post	-	exposure	.	.
a18081909.s5	The	interictal	electroencephalogram	(	EEG	)	showed	a	generalized	slowing	to	5	per	second	theta	rhythms	with	bilateral	generalized	high	-	amplitude	discharges	.	.

a2440413.s4	One	hour	after	the	administration	of	gamma	-	HCH	,	the	activity	of	seizure	-	inducing	agents	was	increased	,	regardless	of	their	mechanism	,	while	24	h	after	gamma	-	HCH	a	differential	response	was	observed	.	.
a8421099.s8	It	is	therefore	very	important	to	follow	the	changes	of	gallbladder	function	during	long	-	term	octreotide	therapy	of	acromegalic	patients	.	.
a6861444.s1	Sodium_chloride	solution	(	0.9	%	)	or	noradrenaline	in	doses	of	4	,	12	and	36	micrograms	h-1	kg-1	was	infused	for	five	consecutive	days	,	either	intrarenally	(	by	a	new	technique	)	or	intravenously	into	rats	with	one	kidney	removed	.	.
a6308277.s6	Acetaminophen	(	up	to	150	micrograms	/	mL	)	did	not	retard	the	incorporation	of	radioactive	adenosine	into	ATP	in	slices	of	rat	cerebral	cortex	.	.
a9523805.s1	BACKGROUND	,	Recent	evidence	suggests	that	transient_neurologic_symptoms	(	TNSs	)	frequently	follow	lidocaine	spinal	anesthesia	but	are	infrequent	with	bupivacaine	.	.
a7516729.s9	The	[	verapamil]o	that	arrested	atrial	beating	(	AC	)	was	also	potentiated	with	the	order	LNa	=	LNa+LCa	=	LNa+HCa	=	LCa	>	HCa	=	N.	The	results	indicate	that	rat	atrial	spontaneous	beating	is	more	dependent	on	[	Na]o	than	on	[	Ca]o	in	a	range	of	+	/-	50	%	of	their	normal	concentration	.	.
a11679859.s1	STUDY	OBJECTIVE	,	We	sought	to	compare	the	rate	of	akathisia	after	administration	of	intravenous	prochlorperazine	as	a	2-minute	bolus	or	15-minute	infusion	.	.

a11198499.s5	The	possible	interaction	of	tizanidine	and	other	antihypertensive	agents	should	be	kept	in	mind	when	prescribing	therapy	to	treat	either	hypertension	or	spasticity	in	such	patients	.	.
a2008831.s5	The	basal	tone	of	the	right	coronary	artery	was	significantly	lower	than	that	of	the	left	coronary	artery	.	.
a1639466.s8	Renal	plasma	flow	increased	,	but	albumin	excretion	and	glomerulosclerosis	did	not	change	after	enalapril	treatment	.	.
a20882060.s6	Electrophysiological	recordings	showed	that	microinjection	of	neurotensin	induced	excitation	of	pallidal	neurons	in	the	presence	of	systemic	haloperidol	administration	.	.

a16680561.s7	The	t	(	1/2,z	)	of	desipramine	was	longer	when	desipramine	was	coadministered	with	cinacalcet	(	21.0	versus	43.3	hs	)	.	.
a6387529.s7	Accumulation	of	drugs	was	not	reflected	in	prolonged	behavioral_impairment	.	.
a17491223.s6	The	increase	in	dP	/	dtejc	during	infusion	of	dobutamine	in	this	group	was	severely	impaired	as	compared	to	the	non	-	ischemic	group	.	.
a9293063.s2	Such	patients	should	be	under	close	follow	-	up	,	preferably	with	periodic	ultrasound	examination	of	the	liver	.	.
a2348231.s3	Whether	pentoxifylline	inhibits	dipyridamole	-	induced	coronary	hyperemia	like	other	methylxanthines	such	as	theophylline	and	should	be	stopped	prior	to	dipyridamole	-	thallium-201	imaging	is	unknown	.	.

a11679859.s12	The	difference	between	the	bolus	and	infusion	groups	in	the	percentage	of	participants	who	saw	a	50	%	reduction	in	their	headache	intensity	within	30	minutes	was	11.8	%	(	95	%	CI	-9.6	%	to	33.3	%	)	.	.
a6634932.s4	The	area	under	the	plasma	concentration	time	curve	at	90	min	was	4	-	12	times	greater	than	for	oral	drug	,	suggesting	the	existence	of	an	absorption	-	limiting	process	in	the	intestine	,	and	providing	an	alternate	form	of	administration	for	quaternary	drugs	.	.
a8669433.s5	This	apparent	difference	in	risk	may	not	be	due	to	differences	in	nephrotoxic	potential	of	the	drugs	themselves	.	.
a8421099.s7	Our	results	suggest	that	the	suppression	of	gallbladder	contractility	is	the	cause	of	the	successive	formation	of	bile	sludge	,	gallstones	,	and	cholecystitis	during	octreotide	therapy	in	Chinese	acromegalic	patients	.	.
a1420741.s5	and	the	treatment	was	planned	to	last	8	weeks	.	.
a6386793.s3	The	overall	incidence	of	side	effects	and	the	frequency	and	severity	of	blurred_vision	,	dry_mouth	,	and	drowsiness	were	significantly	less	with	dothiepin	than	with	amitriptyline	.	.
