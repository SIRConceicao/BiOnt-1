a15957009.s2	Although	the	underlying	mechanism(s	)	are	not	well	understood	,	these	effects	may	involve	an	increase	in	acetylcholine	(	ACh	)	levels	.	.

a12483326.s12	CONCLUSION	,	When	performing	intracarotid	injection	of	carboplatin	,	we	must	be	aware	of	its	potentially	blinding	ocular_toxicity	.	.
a19356307.s3	Analysis	of	neurotransmitter	concentration	in	some	brain	regions	on	the	test	day	showed	that	dopamine	concentration	of	the	vehicle	/	scopolamine	group	was	significantly	lower	than	that	of	the	vehicle	/	vehicle	group	,	but	this	phenomenon	was	reversed	when	s	-	limonene	or	s	-	perillyl_alcohol	were	administered	before	the	injection	of	scopolamine	.	.

a6287825.s3	Sensori	-	motor_neuropathy	was	the	commonest	presentation	(	50	%	)	.	.
a18503483.s5	MRI	demonstrated	hyperintense	T2	signals	in	the	cervical	cord	and	right	brachial	plexus	roots	indicative	of	both	myelitis	and	right	brachial_plexitis	.	.
a11679859.s2	METHODS	,	We	conducted	a	prospective	,	randomized	,	double	-	blind	study	in	the	emergency	department	of	a	central	-	city	teaching	hospital	.	.
a17042910.s10	Systolic	blood	pressure	(	SBP	)	was	measured	on	alternate	days	using	the	tail	-	cuff	method	.	.
a11391224.s4	In	addition	to	renal	allografts	with	TG	,	we	also	examined	grafts	with	acute	rejection	,	recurrent	glomerulonephritis	,	chronic_allograft_nephropathy	and	stable	grafts	(	"	protocol	biopsies	"	)	.	.
a15036754.s2	The	acute	toxicity	of	OPs	is	the	result	of	their	irreversible	binding	with	AChEs	in	the	central	nervous	system	(	CNS	)	,	which	elevates	acetylcholine	(	ACh	)	levels	.	.
a11027905.s9	Significant	increases	in	drowsiness	were	reported	in	patients	treated	with	ketamine	in	both	groups	and	were	more	marked	with	ketamine	0.50	mg	/	kg	.	.
a11256525.s10	This	case	report	highlights	the	fact	that	the	angiotensin_II	receptor	antagonist	losartan	can	cause	serious	unexpected	complications	in	patients	with	renovascular_disease	and	should	be	used	with	extreme	caution	in	this	setting	.	.
a11569530.s1	1	.	.
a16330766.s8	The	observed	drug	-	induced	effects	were	not	due	to	changes	in	the	baseline	fMRI	signal	.	.
a16181582.s1	Valproate	-	induced	encephalopathy	is	a	rare	syndrome	that	may	manifest	in	otherwise	normal	epileptic	individuals	.	.
a9653867.s2	When	they	do	occur	they	are	often	unrecognized	because	of	denial	but	when	significant	may	pose	a	risk	to	both	the	mother	and	her	fetus	.	.
a19631624.s4	To	address	the	potential	confounding	effects	of	the	cannabis	use	of	the	ecstasy	using	group	,	a	second	analysis	included	14	previously	tested	cannabis	users	(	Nestor	,	L.	,	Roberts	,	G.	,	Garavan	,	H.	,	Hester	,	R.	,	2008	.	.
a12202650.s7	Increased	sensitivity	of	the	fusimotor	system	during	acute	muscle_pain	could	be	one	likely	mechanism	to	explain	the	findings	.	.
a12907309.s7	The	results	of	this	study	suggest	that	the	blockade	of	mGluR5	by	MPEP	may	protect	dopaminergic	neurones	against	methamphetamine	-	induced	toxicity	.	.
a11166519.s4	A	range	of	strain	specific	sensitivities	was	documented	with	A	/	J	and	SJL	mice	being	most	sensitive	and	C57BL/6J	most	resistant	.	.
a6103707.s8	There	was	pain	on	i.m	.	.
a1992636.s8	The	mechanism	by	which	omeprazole	caused	the	patient	's	hemolytic_anemia	is	uncertain	,	but	physicians	should	be	alerted	to	this	possible	adverse	effect	.	.
a3412544.s3	By	contrast	,	we	were	unable	to	substantiate	an	increased	risk	from	paracetamol	consumption	for	renal_papillary_necrosis	or	any	of	these	cancers	although	there	was	a	suggestion	of	an	association	with	cancer_of_the_ureter	.	.
a15036754.s6	All	rats	were	terminated	either	24	h	or	3	weeks	after	the	DFP	injection	.	.
a8231633.s5	The	convulsant	activity	,	the	time	of	latency	to	convulse	and	the	mortality	rate	were	assessed	in	each	group	.	.
a230316.s8	Isolated	myelopathy	or	peripheral_neuropathy	,	or	these	manifestations	occurring	together	,	were	infrequent	.	.
a869641.s11	It	is	concluded	that	L	-	dopa	enhances	reflex	bradycardia	through	central	alpha	-	receptor	stimulation	.	.

a2312209.s0	Myocardial_infarction	following	sublingual	administration	of	isosorbide_dinitrate	.	.
a9334596.s7	Endocrine	therapy	consisted	of	testosterone_heptylate	or	human	chorionic	gonadotropin	for	hypogonadism	and	bromocriptine	for	hyperprolactinemia	.	.
a15036754.s9	Atropine	-	MK801	did	not	offer	any	additional	protection	against	DFP	toxicity	.	.
a16160878.s9	Whatever	was	the	dose	,	the	central	administration	of	U	-	II	had	no	effect	on	body	temperature	,	nociception	,	apomorphine	-	induced	penile_erection	and	climbing	behavior	,	and	stress	-	induced	plasma	corticosterone	level	.	.
a9334596.s22	CONCLUSIONS	,	Low	prevalences	and	effects	of	low_testosterone	and	high	prolactin	in_erectile_dysfunction	can	not	justify	their	routine	determination	.	.
a3187073.s11	This	was	followed	by	ventricular_fibrillation	in	one	patient	and	sudden_death	in	another	.	.
a17175308.s15	Five	grafts	were	lost	and	the	patients	returned	to	dialysis	.	.
a11897407.s0	99mTc	-	glucarate	for	detection	of	isoproterenol	-	induced	myocardial_infarction	in	rats	.	.
a3676049.s4	Controlled	hypotension	to	an	average	MAP	of	50	-	55	mm	Hg	was	induced	by	increasing	the	dose	of	isoflurane	,	and	maintained	at	an	inspired	concentration	of	2.2	+	/-	0.2	%	.	.
a12483326.s3	Therefore	,	patients	with	glioblastoma	sometimes	have	intracarotid	injection	of	carcinostatics	added	to	the	treatment	regimen	.	.
a1639466.s6	Enalapril	but	not	nitrendipine	reduced	blood	pressure	significantly	.	.
a7199841.s6	Of	the	15	spinal	cords	of	the	animals	that	received	2-chloroprocaine	-	CE	,	13	showed	subpial_necrosis	,	the	nerve	roots	and	subarachnoid	vessels	were	normal	.	.
a18182964.s6	There	were	no	suggestions	of	interactions	between	clonidine	and	methylphenidate	regarding	cardiovascular	outcomes	.	.
a12443032.s3	In	particular	,	the	tendency	of	cocaine	to	produce	chest_pain	ought	to	be	in	the	mind	of	the	emergency	nurse	when	faced	with	a	young	victim	of	chest_pain	who	is	otherwise	at	low	risk	.	.
a10704919.s0	Hemolysis	of	human	erythrocytes	induced	by	tamoxifen	is	related	to	disruption	of	membrane	structure	.	.
a18208574.s1	OBJECTIVES	,	To	correlate	optical	density	and	percent	inhibition	of	a	two	-	step	heparin	-	induced	thrombocytopenia	(	HIT	)	antigen	assay	with	thrombosis	,	the	assay	utilizes	reaction	inhibition	characteristics	of	a	high	heparin	concentration	.	.

a6634932.s2	Both	anti	-	arrhythmic	efficacy	and	bioavailability	were	compared	to	oral	drug	.	.
a10704919.s9	Hemolysis	caused	by	TAM	was	not	preceded	by	the	leakage	of	_	K(+	)	from	the	cells	,	also	excluding	a	colloid	-	osmotic	type	mechanism	of	hemolysis	,	according	to	the	effects	on	osmotic	fragility	curves	.	.
a18261172.s7	Before	the	switch	,	11.5	%	of	patients	had	high	-	grade	proteinuria	(	>	1.0	g	/	day	)	,	this	increased	to	22.9	%	postswitch	(	p	=	0.006	)	.	.
a3629586.s4	A	nonregenerative	anemia	was	the	most	compromising	of	the	cytopenias	and	occurred	in	approximately	50	%	of	dogs	receiving	400	-	500	mg	/	kg	cefonicid	or	540	-	840	mg	/	kg	cefazedone	.	.
a10704919.s5	Despite	inducing	extensive	erythrocyte	lysis	,	TAM	does	not	shift	the	osmotic	fragility	curves	of	erythrocytes	.	.
a12615818.s1	BACKGROUND	,	Cyproterone_acetate	combined	with	ethinyl_estradiol	(	CPA	/	EE	)	is	licensed	in	the	UK	for	the	treatment	of	women	with	acne	and	hirsutism	and	is	also	a	treatment	option	for	polycystic_ovary_syndrome	(	PCOS	)	.	.
a11897407.s9	The	high	image	quality	suggests	that	high	contrast	images	can	be	obtained	in	humans	and	the	96	h	stability	makes	it	an	ideal	agent	to	detect	,	in	patients	,	early	cardiac_infarction	.	.
a1468485.s4	The	bleeding	ceased	completely	by	the	end	of	treatment	and	the	patient	remained	free	of	hematuria	thereafter	.	.

a20698227.s1	BACKGROUND	/	AIMS	,	Recently	ribavirin	has	been	found	to	inhibit	angiogenesis	and	a	number	of	angiogenesis	inhibitors	such	as	sunitinib	and	sorafenib	have	been	found	to	cause	acute	hemolysis	.	.
a3125768.s7	In	five	rats	that	did	not	become	rigid	,	ICP	and	CVP	did	not	change	following	alfentanil	.	.
a6287825.s7	Isoniazid	was	the	most	frequent	agent	in	drug	-	induced	neuropathy	.	.
a1987816.s3	Patients	were	admitted	to	the	hospital	for	measurement	of	lithium	level	,	creatinine	clearance	,	urine	volume	,	and	maximum	osmolality	.	.
a17175308.s21	The	possibility	of	de	novo	glomerular	pathology	under	SRL	treatment	requires	further	investigation	by	renal	biopsy	.	.

a17466854.s5	Postoperatively	,	all	patients	were	assessed	for	symptoms	of	nausea,_vomiting	,	and	headache	.	.
a14698717.s3	This	case	suggests	that	the	psychotic_symptoms	that	occur	following	phenytoin	treatment	in	some	epileptic	patients	may	be	the	direct	result	of	medication	,	unrelated	to	seizures	.	.
a16330766.s4	The	aim	of	this	study	was	to	assess	the	effects	of	gabapentin	,	a	drug	effective	in	neuropathic_pain	patients	,	on	brain	processing	of	nociceptive	information	in	normal	and	central	sensitization	states	.	.

a230316.s7	In	the	remaining	cases	,	a	combination	of	myelopathy	,	visual_disturbance	,	and	peripheral_neuropathy	was	the	most	common	manifestation	.	.
a8073369.s12	In	summary	,	the	chick	embryo	provides	a	reliable	and	simple	experimental	animal	model	of	coniine	-	induced	arthrogryposis	.	.
a2894766.s3	It	is	suggested	that	the	patient	had	sulfasalazine	-	induced	lupus	,	which	manifested	with	serositis	and	pulmonary	parenchymal	involvement	in	the	absence	of	joint	symptoms	.	.
a9523805.s9	RESULTS	,	Nine	of	30	patients	receiving	lidocaine	experienced	TNSs	,	1	of	30	patients	receiving	prilocaine	(	P	=	0.03	)	had	them	,	and	none	of	30	patients	receiving	bupivacaine	had	TNSs	.	.

a2611118.s3	The	patient	described	developed	chronic_active_hepatitis	after	six	months	therapy	with	diclofenac_sodium	which	progressed	despite	the	withdrawal	of	the	drug	,	a	finding	not	previously	reported	.	.
a9293063.s3	If	the	patient	develops	a	liver_mass	,	because	of	non	-	specific	clinical	features	and	imaging	appearances	,	biopsy	may	be	the	only	way	to	achieve	a	definitive	diagnosis	.	.
a3629586.s7	This	observation	,	along	with	the	rapid	rate	of	decline	in	red	cell	mass	parameters	of	affected	dogs	,	suggests	that	a	hemolytic	component	complicated	the	red	cell	production	problem	and	that	multiple	toxicologic	mechanisms	contributed	to	the	cytopenia	.	.
a17242861.s2	Chromosome	substitution	strains	(	CSS	)	,	in	which	a	single	chromosome	from	one	inbred	strain	(	donor	)	has	been	transferred	onto	a	second	strain	(	host	)	by	repeated	backcrossing	,	may	be	used	to	identify	quantitative	trait	loci	(	QTLs	)	that	contribute	to	seizure	susceptibility	.	.
a11166519.s6	EEG	recordings	were	made	in	SJL	,	A	/	J	and	C57BL/6J	mice	revealing	a	close	correspondence	between	electrical	activity	and	behavior	.	.

a11642480.s2	We	report	a	favorable	response	to	treatment	with	citalopram	by	a	15-year	-	old	boy	with	major_depression	who	exhibited	palpebral_twitching	during	his	first	2	weeks	of	treatment	.	.
a12820454.s9	This	CAB	-	induced	anemia	was	normochromic	and	normocytic	.	.
a17175308.s13	These	patients	showed	persistently	good	graft	function	.	.
a6888657.s2	Over	a	range	of	1	-	150	days	of	DES	treatment	,	pairs	of	control	and	DES	-	treated	rats	were	sacrificed	,	and	their	pituitaries	dissociated	enzymatically	into	single	-	cell	preparations	.	.

a2440413.s6	In	vitro	,	gamma	-	HCH	,	pentylenetetrazol	and	picrotoxin	were	shown	to	inhibit	3H	-	TBOB	binding	in	mouse	whole	brain	,	with	IC50	values	of	4.6	,	404	and	9.4	microM	,	respectively	.	.
a6287825.s8	Migraine	(	20	%	)	was	not	an	uncommon	cause	of	cranial_neuropathy	although	malignancies	arising	from	the	reticuloendothelial	system	or	related	structures	of	the	head	and	neck	were	more	frequent	(	26	%	)	.	.
a20882060.s4	METHODS	,	Behavioral	experiments	and	electrophysiological	recordings	were	performed	in	the	present	study	.	.
a7423039.s0	Metabolic	involvement	in	adriamycin	cardiotoxicity	.	.
a7269015.s0	Busulfan	-	induced	hemorrhagic_cystitis	.	.
a8669433.s3	However	,	three	case	control	studies	,	one	each	in	North	Carolina	,	northern	Maryland	,	and	West	Berlin	,	Germany	,	showed	that	habitual	use	of	acetaminophen	is	also	associated	with	chronic_renal_failure	and	ESRD	,	with	a	relative	risk	in	the	range	of	2	to	4	.	.
a6386793.s2	Dothiepin	and	amitriptyline	were	equally	effective	in	alleviating	the	symptoms	of	depressive_illness	,	and	both	were	significantly	superior	to	placebo	.	.
a12627929.s2	DESIGN	,	Retrospective	analysis	of	a	randomized	phase	II	trial	.	.
a11391224.s11	We	suggest	that	repeated	endothelial_injury	,	including	immunologic_injury	,	may	be	the	cause	of	this	lesion	both	in	allografts	and	native	kidneys	.	.
a3125768.s8	These	observations	suggest	that	rigidity	should	be	prevented	when	alfentanil	,	and	,	presumably	,	other	opiates	,	are	used	in	the	anesthetic	management	of	patients	with	ICP	problems	.	.
a8231633.s4	dose	of	bupivacaine	.	.
a1420741.s9	Biochemically	,	an	increase	in	alkaline	phosphatases	was	noted	in	5	of	8	cases	(	63	%	)	,	and	the	greatest	increases	were	seen	in	those	who	had	elevated	levels	prior	to	treatment	.	.
a3358181.s6	After	delivery	of	the	infant	,	there	should	be	no	contraindication	to	the	use	of	an	alpha	-	adrenergic	vasopressor	such	as	phenylephrine	to	treat	hypotensive	patients	with	tachycardia	.	.
a1420741.s2	Because	of	the	need	for	the	development	of	new	treatments	for	Crohn's_disease	,	a	pilot	study	was	undertaken	to	estimate	the	pharmacodynamics	and	tolerability	of	fusidic_acid	treatment	in	chronic	active	,	therapy	-	resistant	patients	.	.
a17175308.s20	Therefore	,	conversion	should	be	considered	for	patients	who	have	not	developed	advanced	CAN	and	proteinuria	.	.
a17042910.s7	Male	SD	rats	(	n	=	30	)	were	treated	with	Ato	(	50	mg	/	kg	per	day	in	drinking	water	)	or	tap	water	for	15	days	.	.
a17042910.s11	Endothelial	function	was	assessed	by	acetylcholine	-	induced	vasorelaxation	and	phenylephrine	-	induced	vasoconstriction	in	aortic	segments	.	.
a17175308.s14	Serum	creatinine	values	did	not	change	significantly	,	1.98	+	/-	0.8	mg	/	dL	before	SRL	therapy	and	2.53	+	/-	1.9	mg	/	dL	at	last	follow	-	up	(	P	=	.14	)	.	.

a7453952.s6	In	all	the	experiments	,	the	attenuation	of	the	lithium	-	induced	diabetes	-	insipidus	-	like_syndrome	by	amiloride	was	accompanied	by	a	reduction	of	the	ratio	between	the	lithium	concentration	in	the	renal	medulla	and	its	levels	in	the	blood	and	an	elevation	in	the	plasma	potassium	level	.	.
a3693336.s4	The	possible	contribution	of	the	triazolo	group	to	changes	in	affective	status	is	discussed	.	.
a6287825.s4	Guillain	-	Barr___syndrome	was	the	commonest	identifiable	cause	(	15.6	%	)	,	accounting	for	half	of	the	cases	with	motor_neuropathy	.	.
a1639466.s10	Furthermore	,	glomerulosclerosis	index	was	significantly	increased	in	the	nitrendipine	-	treated	group	compared	with	the	hypertensive	controls	(	0.38	+	/-	0.1	versus	0.13	+	/-	0.04	)	.	.
a20698227.s7	In	contrast	with	the	literature	,	serum	levels	of	angiogenesis	factors	did	not	change	significantly	by	pegylated_interferon	and	ribavirin	therapy	.	.
a7449470.s3	A	patient	is	reported	who	developed	progressive	cardiomyopathy	two	and	one	-	half	years	after	receiving	580	mg	/	m2	which	apparently	represents	late	,	late	cardiotoxicity	.	.
a6861444.s4	These	results	suggest	that	hypertension	after	chronic	intrarenal	noradrenaline	infusion	is	produced	by	relatively	higher	levels	of	circulating	noradrenaline	and	by	triggering	of	an	additional	intrarenal	pressor	mechanism	.	.
