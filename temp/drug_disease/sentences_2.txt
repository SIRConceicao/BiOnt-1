a17466854.s1	PURPOSE	,	To	assess	the	incidence	of	postoperative	emetic	side	effects	after	the	administration	of	methylprednisolone	and	gentamicin	into	the	posterior	sub	-	Tenon	's	space	at	the	end	of	routine	cataract	surgery	.	.
a12615818.s4	METHODS	,	Using	the	General	Practice	Research	Database	we	conducted	a	cohort	analysis	and	case	-	control	study	nested	within	a	population	of	women	aged	between	15	and	39	years	with	acne	,	hirsutism	or	PCOS	to	estimate	the	risk	of	VTE	associated	with	CPA	/	EE	.	.
a17854040.s0	Mutations	associated	with	lamivudine	-	resistance	in	therapy	-	na	_	ve	hepatitis_B_virus_(HBV)_infected	patients	with	and	without	HIV_co	-	infection	,	implications	for	antiretroviral	therapy	in	HBV_and_HIV_co	-	infected	South	African	patients	.	.
a18221780.s0	Sex	differences	in	NMDA	antagonist	enhancement	of	morphine	antihyperalgesia	in	a	capsaicin	model	of	persistent	pain	,	comparisons	to	two	models	of	acute_pain	.	.
a10739826.s3	Over	the	period	1993	-	1996	,	551	cases	of	VTE	were	identified	in	Germany	and	the	UK	along	with	2066	controls	.	.
a3560095.s5	Most	side	effects	were	mild	and	related	to	the	GI	tract	.	.
a9334596.s1	PURPOSE	,	We	reviewed	the	results	of	serum	testosterone	and	prolactin	determination	in	1,022	patients	referred	because	of	erectile_dysfunction	and	compared	the	data	with	history	,	results	of	physical	examination	,	other	etiological	investigations	and	effects	of	endocrine	therapy	to	refine	the	rules	of	cost	-	effective	endocrine	screening	and	to	pinpoint	actual	responsibility	for	hormonal	abnormalities	.	.
a11897407.s3	A	new	infarct	-	avid	radiopharmaceutical	based	on	glucaric_acid	was	prepared	in	the	hospital	radiopharmacy	of	the	INCMNSZ	.	.
a17042910.s1	1	.	.
a17466854.s9	All	adverse	effects	were	self	-	limiting	.	.
a8421099.s3	In	all	of	7	patients	examined	acutely	,	gallbladder	contractility	was	inhibited	after	a	single	100-micrograms	injection	.	.
a1420741.s3	Eight	Crohn's_disease	patients	were	included	.	.
a20621845.s5	RESULTS	,	Despite	similar	external	diameters	among	CaCl(2)-treated	,	non	-	CaCl(2)-treated	and	NaCl	-	treated	segments	,	aneurymal	alteration	(	n=6	,	50	%	)	,	media	degeneration	with	regional	disruption	,	fragmentation	of	elastic	fiber	,	and	increased	collagen	deposition	(	n=12	,	100	%	)	were	demonstrated	in	CaCl(2)-treated	segments	.	.
a1468485.s2	Conservative	treatment	,	including	bladder	irrigation	with	physiological	saline	and	instillation	of	prostaglandin_F2_alpha	,	failed	to	totally	control	hemorrhage	.	.
a2549018.s5	The	authors	suggest	that	fluoxetine	-	induced	akathisia	may	be	caused	by	serotonergically	mediated	inhibition	of	dopaminergic	neurotransmission	and	that	the	pathophysiology	of	fluoxetine	-	induced	akathisia	and	tricyclic	antidepressant	-	induced	"	jitteriness	"	may	be	identical	.	.
a12483326.s13	It	is	recommended	that	further	studies	and	investigations	are	undertaken	in	the	effort	to	minimize	such	severe	side	effects	.	.
a11027905.s5	Ketamine	,	but	not	saline	solution	,	significantly	reduced	the	pain	intensity	in	almost	all	the	patients	at	both	doses	.	.
a14698717.s2	The	case	of	a	nonepileptic	patient	who	developed	psychosis	following	phenytoin	treatment	for	trigeminal_neuralgia	is	described	.	.
a7862923.s1	Carbamazepine	was	switched	to	its	10-keto	analogue	oxcarbazepine	among	six	difficult	-	to	-	treat	schizophrenic	or	organic_psychotic	patients	using	concomitantly	haloperidol	,	chlorpromazine	or	clozapine	.	.
a9334596.s15	in	5	men	and	was	normal	in	2	at	repeat	determination	.	.
a15120741.s3	In	Mg(2+)-free	bathing	medium	containing	bicuculline	,	conditions	designed	to	increase	excitability	in	the	slices	,	electrical	stimulation	of	the	hilus	resulted	in	a	single	population	spike	in	granule	cells	from	control	mice	and	pilocarpine	-	treated	mice	that	did	not	experience	SE	.	.
a17854040.s5	Serum	samples	were	PCR	amplified	with	HBV	reverse	transcriptase	(	RT	)	primers	,	followed	by	direct	sequencing	across	the	tyrosine	-	methionine	-	aspartate	-	aspartate	(	YMDD	)	motif	of	the	major	catalytic	region	in	the	C	domain	of	the	HBV	RT	enzyme	.	.
a12695819.s8	Diffusion	-	weighted	imaging	may	be	useful	in	predicting	the	outcomes	of	the	lesions	of	tacrolimus	-	induced	neurotoxicity	.	.
a18221780.s1	In	acute_pain	models	,	N	-	methyl	-	D	-	aspartate	(	NMDA	)	antagonists	enhance	the	antinociceptive	effects	of	morphine	to	a	greater	extent	in	males	than	females	.	.
a18996674.s0	Intracavernous	epinephrine	,	a	minimally	invasive	treatment	for	priapism	in	the	emergency	department	.	.
a869641.s9	5-HTP	(	5	mg	/	kg	i.v	.	)	.
a11569530.s11	For	compounds	that	have	shown	TDP	in	the	clinic	(	terfenadine	,	terodiline	,	cisapride	)	there	is	little	differentiation	between	the	dog	ED50	and	the	efficacious	free	plasma	concentrations	in	man	(	<	10-fold	)	reflecting	their	limited	safety	margins	.	.
a2894766.s2	After	cessation	of	the	sulfasalazine	and	completion	of	a	six	-	week	course	of	corticosteroids	,	these	problems	resolved	over	a	period	of	four	to	six	months	.	.
a7444978.s4	Abnormal_movements	and	deafness	occurred	only	in	rats	treated	during	the	preweaning	period	,	within	this	period	the	greatest	sensitivities	for	these	abnormalities	occurred	from	2	to	11	-	17	and	5	to	11	days	of	age	,	respectively	,	indicating	that	the	cochlea	is	more	sensitive	to	streptomycin	than	the	site	(	vestibular	or	central	)	responsible	for	the	dyskinesias	.	.
a11391224.s8	Mild	PTCR	in	allografts	without	TG	did	not	predict	renal_failure	or	significant	proteinuria	after	follow	-	up	periods	of	between	3	months	and	1	year	.	.
a20698227.s8	We	found	no	correlation	of	angiogenesis	soluble	markers	with	either	hemoglobin	or	haptoglobin	.	.
a6888657.s8	All	these	effects	of	DES	were	more	pronounced	among	previously	ovariectomized	animals	.	.
a2348231.s0	Pentoxifylline	(	Trental	)	does	not	inhibit	dipyridamole	-	induced	coronary	hyperemia	,	implications	for	dipyridamole	-	thallium-201	myocardial	imaging	.	.
a18081909.s1	BACKGROUND	,	We	report	on	the	manifestation	of	a	levetiracetam	(	LEV)-induced	encephalopathy	.	.
a16680561.s2	The	purpose	of	this	study	was	to	evaluate	the	effect	of	cinacalcet	on	CYP2D6	activity	,	using	desipramine	as	a	probe	substrate	,	in	healthy	subjects	.	.
a9523805.s2	However	,	identification	of	a	short	-	acting	local	anesthetic	to	substitute	for	lidocaine	for	brief	surgical	procedures	remains	an	important	goal	.	.
a20698227.s6	Hemoglobin	levels	also	decreased	but	insignificantly	by	treatment	.	.
a2071257.s5	Before	and	0.5	,	1	,	2	,	3	,	and	6	h	after	injection	the	subjects	were	given	attention	and	mnemonic	tests	.	.
a6666578.s1	Male	Sprague	-	Dawley	rats	were	treated	with	D	-	penicillamine	(	D	-	pen	)	500	mg	/	kg	/	day	for	10	or	42	days	.	.
a3173179.s1	Verapamil	is	an	effective	and	relatively	-	safe	antihypertensive	drug	.	.
a10704919.s11	Either	alpha	-	T	or	alpha	-	TAc	increases	membrane	packing	and	prevents	TAM	partition	into	model	membranes	.	.
a18996674.s2	A	45-year	-	old	man	,	an	admitted	frequent	cocaine	user	,	presented	to	the	Emergency	Department	(	ED	)	on	two	separate	occasions	with	a	history	of	priapism	after	cocaine	use	.	.
a16330766.s1	Abnormal	processing	of	somatosensory	inputs	in	the	central	nervous	system	(	central	sensitization	)	is	the	mechanism	accounting	for	the	enhanced	pain	sensitivity	in	the	skin	surrounding	tissue_injury	(	secondary_hyperalgesia	)	.	.
a10704919.s13	Therefore	,	TAM	-	induced	hemolysis	results	from	a	structural	perturbation	of	red	cell	membrane	,	leading	to	changes	in	the	framework	of	the	erythrocyte	membrane	and	its	cytoskeleton	caused	by	its	high	partition	in	the	membrane	.	.
a20621845.s9	CONCLUSION	,	This	study	establishes	a	TAA	model	by	periarterial	CaCl(2	)	exposure	in	rats	,	and	demonstrates	a	significant	elevation	of	expression	of	MMP-2	,	MMP-9	,	ADAM10	and	ADAM17	in	the	pathogenesis	of	vascular	remodeling	.	.
a10739826.s6	We	conclude	that	second	and	third	generation	agents	are	associated	with	equivalent	risks	of	VTE	when	the	same	agent	is	used	repeatedly	after	interruption	periods	or	when	users	are	switched	between	the	two	generations	of	pills	.	.
a15036754.s10	In	conclusion	,	CPA	,	diazepam	and	2PAM	in	combination	with	atropine	prevented	the	occurrence	of	serious	signs	of	poisoning	and	thus	reduced	the	toxicity	of	DFP	in	rat	.	.
a7858459.s3	This	complication	reappeared	on	day	25	during	the	second	dose	of	5-fluorouracil	and	folinic_acid	,	which	were	then	the	only	drugs	given	.	.
a17854040.s3	The	latter	group	was	further	sub	-	divided	into	13	occult	HBV	(	HBsAg	-	negative	)	and	7	overt	HBV	(	HBsAg-	positive	)	patients	.	.
a3173179.s0	Verapamil	withdrawal	as	a	possible	cause	of	myocardial_infarction	in	a	hypertensive	woman	with	a	normal	coronary	angiogram	.	.
a3997294.s3	Immediate	but	gradual	improvement	followed	withdrawal	of	amiodarone	and	treatment	with	prednisolone	.	.
a7858459.s4	Because	folinic_acid	was	unlikely	to	be	associated	with	this	condition	,	neurotoxicity	due	to	high	-	dose	5-fluorouracil	was	highly	suspected	.	.
a1436384.s3	A	single	18.4	mg	/	kg	(	i.p	.	)	.
a2611118.s2	Although	generally	well	-	tolerated	,	asymptomatic	abnormalities_of_liver_function	have	been	recorded	and	,	less	commonly	,	severe	hepatitis	induced	by	diclofenac	.	.
a9195768.s4	In	these	individuals	,	side	effects	are	most	likely	generated	superficially	in	the	skin	.	.
a15632880.s7	RESULTS	,	Sixty	-	seven	of	926	patients	(	7.2	%	)	required	discontinuation	of	spironolactone	due	to	hyperkalemia	(	n	=	33	)	or	renal_failure	(	n	=	34	)	.	.
a12202650.s2	This	study	tested	the	hypothesis	that	activation	of	nociceptive_muscle	afferent	fibers	would	be	linked	to	an	increased	excitability	of	the	human	jaw	-	stretch	reflex	and	whether	this	process	would	be	sensitive	to	length	and	velocity	of	the	stretch	.	.
a3341566.s0	Systolic	pressure	variation	is	greater	during	hemorrhage	than	during	sodium_nitroprusside	-	induced	hypotension	in	ventilated	dogs	.	.
a7858459.s2	He	developed	acute	neurologic	symptoms	of	mental	confusion	,	disorientation	and	irritability	,	and	then	lapsed	into	a	deep	coma	,	lasting	for	approximately	40	hours	during	the	first	dose	(	day	2	)	of	5-fluorouracil	and	folinic_acid	infusion	.	.
a19631624.s11	These	results	elucidated	ecstasy	-	related	deficits	,	only	some	of	which	might	be	attributed	to	cannabis	use	.	.
a15120741.s6	These	data	support	the	hypothesis	that	SE	-	induced	mossy	fiber	sprouting	and	synaptic	reorganization	are	relevant	characteristics	of	seizure	development	in	these	murine	strains	,	resembling	rat	models	of	human	temporal_lobe_epilepsy	.	.
a7199841.s1	The	purpose	of	this	study	was	to	evaluate	the	neurologic	consequences	of	deliberate	subarachnoid	injection	of	large	volumes	of	2-chloroprocaine	-	CE	in	experimental	animals	.	.
a2611118.s0	Chronic_active_hepatitis	associated	with	diclofenac_sodium	therapy	.	.
a16680561.s6	Relative	to	desipramine	alone	,	mean	AUC	and	C(max	)	of	desipramine	increased	3.6-	and	1.8-fold	when	coadministered	with	cinacalcet	.	.
a20882060.s2	Previous	studies	have	indicated	that	the	globus	pallidus	receives	neurotensinergic	innervation	from	the	striatum	,	and	systemic	administration	of	a	neurotensin	analog	could	produce	antiparkinsonian	effects	.	.
a15632880.s2	Because	treatments	for	heart_failure	have	changed	since	the	benefits	of	spironolactone	were	reported	,	the	prevalence	of	these	complications	may	differ	in	current	clinical	practice	.	.
a1786266.s1	The	rabbit_syndrome	is	an	extrapyramidal	side	effect	associated	with	chronic	neuroleptic	therapy	.	.
a8302922.s8	60	min	,	30	+	/-	7.5	ml/100	g	/	min	(	P	<	0.05	)	)	.	.
a11198499.s1	Centrally	acting	alpha-2	adrenergic	agonists	are	one	of	several	pharmacologic	agents	used	in	the	treatment	of	spasticity	related	to	disorders_of_the_central_nervous_system	.	.
a7453952.s7	It	is	concluded	that	acute	amiloride	administration	to	lithium	-	treated	patients	suffering	from	polydipsia	and	polyuria	might	relieve	these	patients	but	prolonged	amiloride	supplementation	would	result	in	elevated	lithium	levels	and	might	be	hazardous	.	.
a7468724.s2	Associated	corticosteroid	therapy	and	twin	gestations	appear	to	be	predisposing	factors	.	.
a3750012.s1	We	have	described	a	unique	patient	who	had	reversible	and	dose	-	related	myasthenia_gravis	after	penicillamine	and	chloroquine	therapy	for	rheumatoid_arthritis	.	.
a2951327.s3	Mean	arterial	pressure	(	as	a	percentage	of	control	+	/-	SEM	)	during	randomized	infusions	of	0.03	,	0.1	,	0.3	,	or	1.0	microgram	/	kg	/	min	was	99	+	/-	1	,	95	+	/-	1	(	p	less	than	0.05	)	,	93	+	/-	1	(	p	less	than	0.01	)	,	or	79	+	/-	6	%	(	p	less	than	0.001	)	,	respectively	,	but	no	tachycardia	and	no	augmentation	of	the	norepinephrine	release	rate	(	up	to	0.3	microgram	/	kg	/	min	)	were	observed	,	which	is	in	contrast	to	comparable	hypotension	induced	by	hydralazine	or	nitroglycerin	.	.
a17175308.s19	Heavy	proteinuria	was	common	after	the	use	of	SRL	as	rescue	therapy	for	renal	transplantation	.	.
a2673163.s6	These	data	indicate	that	(	1	)	the	apparent	incidence	of	stroke	related	to	cocaine	use	is	increasing	,	(	2	)	cocaine	-	associated	stroke	occurs	primarily	in	young	adults	,	(	3	)	stroke	may	follow	any	route	of	cocaine	administration	,	(	4	)	stroke	after	cocaine	use	is	frequently	associated	with	intracranial_aneurysms	and	arteriovenous_malformations	,	and	(	5	)	in	cocaine	-	associated	stroke	,	the	frequency	of	intracranial_hemorrhage	exceeds	that	of	cerebral_infarction	.	.
a11897407.s7	Thirty	minutes	after	99mTc	-	glucarate	administration	the	standardised	heart	uptake	value	S(h)UV	was	4.7	in	infarcted	rat	heart	which	is	six	times	more	than	in	normal	rats	.	.
a16330766.s9	These	findings	indicate	that	gabapentin	has	a	measurable	antinociceptive	effect	and	a	stronger	antihyperalgesic	effect	most	evident	in	the	brain	areas	undergoing	deactivation	,	thus	supporting	the	concept	that	gabapentin	is	more	effective	in	modulating	nociceptive	transmission	when	central	sensitization	is	present	.	.
a15458908.s8	Raloxifene	did	not	increase	risk	for	cataracts	(	RR	0.9	,	95	%	CI	0.8	-	1.1	)	,	gallbladder_disease	(	RR	1.0	,	95	%	CI	0.7	-	1.3	)	,	endometrial_hyperplasia	(	RR	1.3	,	95	%	CI	0.4	-	5.1	)	,	or	endometrial_cancer	(	RR	0.9	,	95	%	CI	0.3	-	2.7	)	.	.
a567256.s3	The	possibility	that	the	intraarterial_lesions	might	represent	independent	primary	tumors	is	considered	.	.
a7423039.s3	A	possible	involvement	of	energy	metabolism	was	suggested	previously	,	and	in	this	study	the	adenylate	energy	charge	and	phosphorylcreatine	mole	fraction	were	determined	in	the	adriamycin	-	treated	cells	.	.
a15036754.s5	The	control	rats	received	atropine_sulfate	,	but	also	saline	and	olive	oil	instead	of	other	antidotes	and	DFP	,	respectively	.	.
a11679859.s15	The	efficacy	of	prochlorperazine	in	the	treatment	of	headache	and	nausea	likewise	did	not	appear	to	be	affected	by	the	rate	of	administration	,	although	no	formal	statistical	comparisons	were	made	.	.
a8073369.s8	The	deformations	caused	by	both	coniine	and	nicotine	sulfate	were	excessive_flexion_or_extension_of_one_or_more_toes	.	.
a7248170.s4	The	optimal	time	for	the	initial	dose	of	carbon_tetrachloride	was	after	14	days	on	phenobarbitone	.	.
a11027905.s0	Analgesic	effect	of	intravenous	ketamine	in	cancer	patients	on	morphine	therapy	,	a	randomized	,	controlled	,	double	-	blind	,	crossover	,	double	-	dose	study	.	.
a12443032.s4	The	mechanism	of	chest_pain	related	to	cocaine	use	is	discussed	and	treatment	dilemmas	are	discussed	.	.
a3341566.s1	The	systolic	pressure	variation	(	SPV	)	,	which	is	the	difference	between	the	maximal	and	minimal	values	of	the	systolic	blood	pressure	(	SBP	)	after	one	positive	-	pressure	breath	,	was	studied	in	ventilated	dogs	subjected	to	hypotension	.	.
a8073369.s6	Both	compounds	caused	deformations	and	lethality	in	a	dose	-	dependent	manner	.	.
a3187073.s5	Before	treatment	all	patients	had	a	cardiac	evaluation	and	during	treatment	serial	ECG	recordings	were	performed	.	.
a1728522.s0	Granulomatous_hepatitis	due	to	combination_of_amoxicillin_and_clavulanic_acid	.	.
a3125768.s1	Intracranial	pressure	(	ICP	)	was	measured	during	alfentanil	-	induced	rigidity	in	rats	.	.
a6229975.s6	In	patients	with	cardiomegaly	,	the	increase	in	heart	size	was	similar	in	both	groups	.	.
a8231633.s3	or	an	equal	volume	of	saline	for	the	control	group	(	n	=	20	)	,	15	minutes	later	,	all	the	animals	were	injected	with	a	single	50	mg	/	kg	/	i.p	.	.
a2887062.s9	However	,	only	secretory	granules	showed	the	positive	reaction	products	for	prolactin	6	h	after	bromocriptine	treatment	of	the	adenoma	cells	.	.

a3782049.s3	The	case	of	a	schizophrenic	patient	is	reported	to	illustrate	massive	rhabdomyolysis	and	subsequent	acute_renal_failure	following	molindone	administration	.	.
a6229975.s0	Changes	in	heart	size	during	long	-	term	timolol	treatment	after	myocardial_infarction	.	.
a9334596.s12	Most	of	the	other	low	testosterone	levels	seemed	to	result	from	nonorganic	hypothalamic_dysfunction	because	of	normal	serum	luteinizing	hormone	and	prolactin	and	to	have	only	a	small	role	in	erectile_dysfunction	(	definite	improvement	in	only	16	of	44	[	36	%	]	after	androgen	therapy	,	normal	morning	or	nocturnal	erections	in	30	%	and	definite	vasculogenic	contributions	in	42	%	)	.	.

a2887062.s7	The	prolactinoma	cells	at	this	time	were	well	granulated	,	with	vesiculated	rough	endoplasmic	reticulum	and	markedly	dilated	Golgi	cisternae	.	.
a3629586.s5	All	three	cytopenias	were	completely	reversible	following	cessation	of	treatment	,	the	time	required	for	recovery	of	the	erythron	(	approximately	1	month	)	was	considerably	longer	than	that	of	the	granulocytes	and	platelets	(	hours	to	a	few	days	)	.	.
a15278670.s13	It	is	suggested	that	sevoflurane	reduces	the	convulsive	effect	of	lidocaine	toxicity	but	carries	some	risk	due	to	circulatory	depression	.	.
a9401499.s2	We	attempted	to	find	underlying	similarities	,	evaluate	the	risk	factors	,	and	identify	appropriate	treatment	for	this	complication	.	.
a18208574.s5	At	diagnosis	there	was	no	significant	difference	in	OD	between	HIT	patients	with	thrombosis	and	those	with	isolated	-	HIT	.	.
a2348231.s6	Baseline	circumflex	coronary	blood	flows	did	not	differ	significantly	among	treatment	groups	.	.
a10807237.s9	The	differences	in	mortality	and	morbidity	between	the	two	groups	were	not	significant	.	.
a12695819.s7	The	remaining	1	patient	(	20.0	%	)	showed	lower	than	normal	ADC	value	and	showed	incomplete	resolution	with	cortical_laminar_necrosis	.	.
a3173179.s2	Serious	adverse	effects	are	uncommon	and	mainly	have	been	related	to	the	depression	of	cardiac	contractility	and	conduction	,	especially	when	the	drug	is	combined	with	beta	-	blocking	agents	.	.
a12907309.s6	MPEP	administered	into	the	striatum	at	high	concentrations	(	500	microM	)	increased	extracellular	dopamine	levels	,	while	lower	concentrations	(	50	-	100	microM	)	were	devoid	of	any	effect	.	.
a11166519.s2	Cocaine	was	injected	ip	over	a	range	of	doses	(	50	-	100	mg	/	kg	)	and	behavior	was	monitored	for	20	minutes	.	.
a6666578.s6	In	experimental	animals	excess	deposition	of	collagen	and	glycoaminoglycans	was	observed	in	the	subendothelial	and	medial	layer	of	the	aortic	wall	,	together	with	prominent	basal	membrane	substance	around	aortic	smooth	muscle	cells	.	.
a16680561.s8	The	t	(	max	)	was	similar	between	the	regimens	.	.
a12907309.s2	Methamphetamine	(	10	mg	/	kg	sc	)	,	administered	five	times	,	reduced	the	levels	of	dopamine	and	its	metabolites	in	striatal	tissue	when	measured	72	h	after	the	last	injection	.	.
a6308277.s5	In	the	absence	of	caffeine	,	acetaminophen	(	up	to	300	mg	/	kg	)	did	not	modify	the	seizures	induced	by	maximal	electroshock	and	did	not	alter	the	convulsant	dose	of	pentylenetetrezol	in	mice	(	tests	performed	by	the	Anticonvulsant	Screening	Project	of	NINCDS	)	.	.
a15632880.s9	Patients	who	developed	renal_insufficiency	had	lower	baseline	body	weight	and	higher	baseline	serum	creatinine	,	required	higher	doses	of	loop	diuretics	,	and	were	more	likely	to	be	treated	with	thiazide	diuretics	than	controls	.	.
a2008831.s6	The	percentage	of	vasoconstriction	of	the	right	coronary	artery	was	significantly	higher	than	that	of	the	left	coronary	artery	.	.
a2096243.s1	Organic_mental_disorder	was	observed	in	a	29-year	-	old	female	in	the	prognostic	period	after	the	onset	of	carmofur	-	induced	leukoencephalopathy	.	.
a16330766.s0	Pharmacological	modulation	of	pain	-	related	brain	activity	during	normal	and	central	sensitization	states	in	humans	.	.
a1420741.s12	Because	there	seems	to	exist	a	scientific	rationale	for	the	use	of	fusidic_acid	at	the	cytokine	level	in	inflammatory_bowel_disease	,	we	suggest	that	the	role	of	this	treatment	should	be	further	investigated	.	.
a9401499.s7	Treatment	for	ticlopidine	-	induced	aplastic_anemia	with	colony	-	stimulating	factors	seemed	to	have	little	effect	.	.
a9523805.s8	In	the	evening	of	postoperative	day	1	,	patients	were	evaluated	for	TNSs	by	a	physician	unaware	of	the	drug	administered	and	the	details	of	the	anesthetic	procedure	.	.
a3714122.s2	Brain	and	spinal	cord	NTE	activities	were	measured	in	Long	-	Evans	male	rats	1	hr	post	-	exposure	to	various	dosages	of	Mipafox	(	ip	,	1	-	15	mg	/	kg	)	.	.
a2670794.s2	Injection	of	Captopril	(	1	mg	/	kg	)	,	an	inhibitor	of	angiotensin	converting	enzyme	(	ACE	)	,	reduced	both	pulmonary_and_renal_insufficiency	in	this	rat	model	.	.
a435349.s5	bolus	dose	.	.
a16298782.s1	The	nitric_oxide	(	NO	)	inhibitor	nitro	-	L	-	arginine_methyl_ester	(	L	-	NAME	)	may	act	as	an	otoprotectant	against	high	-	frequency_hearing_loss	caused	by	gentamicin	,	but	further	studies	are	needed	to	confirm	this	.	.
a9523805.s11	CONCLUSIONS	,	Prilocaine	may	be	preferable	to	lidocaine	for	short	surgical	procedures	because	it	has	a	similar	duration	of	action	but	a	lower	incidence	of	TNSs	.	.
a2440413.s0	Differential	effects	of	gamma	-	hexachlorocyclohexane	(	lindane	)	on	pharmacologically	-	induced	seizures	.	.
a230316.s0	Neurotoxicity	of	halogenated_hydroxyquinolines	,	clinical	analysis	of	cases	reported	outside	Japan	.	.
a8302922.s2	An	initial	dose	of	0.1	microgram.kg-1.min-1	of	PGE1	(	15	patients	)	,	or	10	micrograms.kg-1.min-1	of	TMP	(	15	patients	)	was	administered	intravenously	after	the	dural	opening	and	the	dose	was	adjusted	to	maintain	the	mean	arterial	blood	pressure	(	MAP	)	at	about	60	mmHg	.	.
a12907309.s4	A	single	MPEP	(	5	mg	/	kg	ip	)	injection	reduced	the	basal	extracellular	dopamine	level	in	the	striatum	,	as	well	as	dopamine	release	stimulated	either	by	methamphetamine	(	10	mg	/	kg	sc	)	or	by	intrastriatally	administered	veratridine	(	100	microM	)	.	.
a17242861.s11	This	approach	provides	a	framework	for	identifying	potentially	novel	homologous	candidate	genes	for	human	temporal_lobe_epilepsy	.	.
a20882060.s7	The	neurotensin_type-1_receptor_antagonist	SR48692	blocked	both	the	behavioral	and	the	electrophysiological	effects	induced	by	neurotensin	.	.
a7858459.s7	It	is	necessary	that	both	oncologists	and	neurologists	be	fully	aware	of	this	unusual	complication	.	.
a6666578.s3	Changes	in	aortic	morphology	were	examined	by	light-	and	transmission	-	electron	microscopy	(	TEM	)	.	.
a18343374.s2	DESIGN	,	Case	study	.	.
a1728522.s4	As	penicillin	derivatives	and	amoxicillin	alone	are	known	to	induce	such	types	of	lesions	,	the	amoxicillin	component	,	with	or	without	a	potentiating	effect	of	clavulanic_acid	,	might	have	a	major	role	.	.
a11679859.s5	The	main	outcome	was	the	number	of	study	participants	experiencing	akathisia	within	60	minutes	of	administration	.	.
a12483326.s9	RESULTS	,	He	was	treated	with	intravenous	administration	of	corticosteroids	and	glycerin	for	6	days	after	the	injection	.	.
a3125768.s2	Ten	rats	had	arterial	,	central	venous	(	CVP	)	,	and	subdural	cannulae	inserted	under	halothane	anesthesia	.	.
a19631624.s7	Ecstasy	users	performed	significantly	worse	in	learning	and	memory	compared	to	controls	and	cannabis	users	.	.
a84204.s0	Pharmacokinetic	and	clinical	studies	in	patients	with	cimetidine	-	associated	mental	confusion	.	.
a84204.s6	Patients	likely	to	have	both	raised	trough	-	concentrations	and	mental	confusion	are	those	with	both	severe	renal_and_hepatic_dysfunction	.	.
a17242861.s10	CSS	mapping	suggests	seizure	susceptibility	loci	on	mouse	Chromosomes	10	and	18	.	.
a7516729.s6	All	negative	chronotropic	effects	were	BF	-	dependent	.	.
a12615818.s3	We	believe	the	results	of	those	studies	may	have	been	affected	by	residual	confounding	.	.
a8073369.s1	Coniine	,	an	alkaloid	from	Conium	maculatum	(	poison	hemlock	)	,	has	been	shown	to	be	teratogenic	in	livestock	.	.
a6386793.s0	A	double	-	blind	study	of	the	efficacy	and	safety	of	dothiepin_hydrochloride	in	the	treatment	of	major	depressive_disorder	.	.
a7858459.s6	High	-	dose	5-fluorouracil	/	folinic_acid	infusion	therapy	has	recently	become	a	popular	regimen	for	various	cancers	.	.
a9195768.s3	Two	patients	are	presented	with	tingling_or_burning_sensations	limited	to	areas	of	heat	exposure	or	sunburn	.	.
a11569530.s7	On	the	basis	that	only	free	drug	in	the	systemic	circulation	will	elicit	a	pharmacological	response	target	,	free	concentrations	in	plasma	were	selected	to	mimic	the	free	drug	exposures	in	man	.	.
a6133211.s3	In	the	twin	pregnancy	,	the	mother	had	Crohn's_disease	.	.
a17242861.s3	QTLs	for	susceptibility	to	pilocarpine	-	induced	seizures	,	a	model	of	temporal_lobe_epilepsy	,	have	not	been	reported	,	and	CSS	have	not	previously	been	used	to	localize	seizure	susceptibility	genes	.	.
a2670794.s4	The	contents	of	albumin	in	the	lungs	were	not	changed	,	indicating	that	Captopril	did	not	influence	the	extravasation	of	protein	.	.
a19631624.s2	In	addition	,	working	memory	processing	in	ecstasy	users	has	been	shown	to	be	associated	with	neural	alterations	in	hippocampal	and/or	cortical	regions	as	measured	by	functional	magnetic	resonance	imaging	(	fMRI	)	.	.
a6308277.s3	Studies	in	DBA/2J	mice	showed	that	,	1	)	pretreatment	with	acetaminophen	(	100	mg	/	kg	)	increased	the	interval	between	the	administration	of	caffeine	(	300	to	450	mg	/	kg	IP	)	and	the	onset	of	fatal	convulsions	by	a	factor	of	about	two	,	and	2	)	pretreatment	with	acetaminophen	(	75	mg	/	kg	)	reduced	the	incidence	of	audiogenic	seizures	produced	in	the	presence	of	caffeine	(	12.5	to	75	mg	/	kg	IP	)	.	.
a1639466.s1	The	effect	of	a	6-week	treatment	with	the	calcium	channel	blocker	nitrendipine	or	the	angiotensin	converting	enzyme	inhibitor	enalapril	on	blood	pressure	,	albuminuria	,	renal	hemodynamics	,	and	morphology	of	the	nonclipped	kidney	was	studied	in	rats	with	two	-	kidney	,	one	clip	renovascular_hypertension	.	.
a18208574.s3	RESULTS	,	Forty	of	94	HIT	patients	had	thrombosis	at	diagnosis	,	54/94	had	isolated	-	HIT	without	thrombosis	.	.
a15957009.s1	Antagonists	at	serotonin	type	6	(	5-HT(6	)	)	receptors	show	activity	in	models	of	learning	and	memory	.	.
a17854040.s2	Thirty	-	five	lamivudine	-	na	_	ve	HBV_infected	patients	with	or	without	HIV_co	-	infection	were	studied	,	15	chronic	HBV_mono	-	infected	patients	and	20	HBV	-	HIV_co	-	infected	patients	.	.
a11391224.s6	RESULTS	,	We	found	PTCR	in	14	of	15	cases	of	TG	,	in	7	transplant	biopsy	specimens	without	TG	,	and	in	13	of	143	native	kidney	biopsy	specimens	.	.
a16160878.s8	Intracerebroventricular	injection	of	U	-	II	also	caused	an	increase	in	,	food	intake	at	doses	of	100	and	1,000	ng	/	mouse	,	water	intake	at	doses	of	100	-	10,000	ng	/	mouse	,	and	horizontal	locomotion	activity	at	a	dose	of	10,000	ng	/	mouse	.	.
a2887062.s1	To	clarify	the	effects	of	bromocriptine	on	prolactinoma	cells	in	vivo	,	immunohistochemical	,	ultrastructural	and	morphometrical	analyses	were	applied	to	estrogen	-	induced	rat	prolactinoma	cells	1	h	and	6	h	after	injection	of	bromocriptine	(	3	mg	/	kg	of	body	weight	)	.	.
a15036754.s4	The	rats	received	AChE	reactivator	pralidoxime-2-chloride	(	2PAM	)	(	30.0	mg	/	kg	BW	)	,	anticonvulsant	diazepam	(	2.0	mg	/	kg	BW	)	,	A(1)-adenosine	receptor	agonist	N(6)-cyclopentyl_adenosine	(	CPA	)	(	2.0	mg	/	kg	BW	)	,	NMDA	-	receptor	antagonist	dizocilpine_maleate	(	+	-MK801	hydrogen	maleate	)	(	2.0	mg	/	kg	BW	)	or	their	combinations	with	cholinolytic	drug	atropine_sulfate	(	50.0	mg	/	kg	BW	)	immediately	or	30	min	after	the	single	SC	injection	of	DFP	.	.
a7248170.s3	The	optimal	rat	size	to	begin	phenobarbitone	was	determined	as	100	g	,	and	this	size	as	a	group	had	a	mean	maximum	relative	liver	weight	increase	47	%	greater	than	normal	rats	of	the	same	body	weight	.	.
a9334596.s13	Determining	testosterone	only	in	cases	of	low_sexual_desire	or	abnormal	physical	examination	would	have	missed	40	%	of	the	cases	with	low	testosterone	,	including	37	%	of	those	subsequently	improved	by	androgen	therapy	.	.
a19356307.s0	Components	of	lemon	essential	oil	attenuate	dementia	induced	by	scopolamine	.	.
a2008831.s4	In	the	control	group	neither	ischemic	ST	change	nor	localized	spasm	occurred	.	.
a12202650.s6	The	normalized	reflex	amplitude	was	significantly	higher	during	pain	,	but	only	at	faster	stretches	in	the	painful_muscle	.	.
a15278670.s2	The	convulsive	threshold	(	mean	+	/-	SD	)	was	41.4	+	/-	6.5	mg	.	.
a7516729.s3	in	control	Krebs	-	Ringer	containing	137	mM	Na	and	1.35	mM	Ca	(	N	)	.	.
a6133211.s6	Despite	reports	to	the	contrary	,	it	is	suggested	that	sulphasalazine	may	be	teratogenic	.	.
a2673163.s4	Intracranial_aneurysms	or	arteriovenous_malformations	were	present	in	17	of	32	patients	studied	angiographically	or	at	autopsy	,	cerebral_vasculitis	was	present	in	two	patients	.	.
a2070391.s1	Previous	reports	have	suggested	that	pain	associated	with	the	injection	of	lidocaine	is	related	to	the	acidic	pH	of	the	solution	.	.
a20470218.s3	This	study	analyzed	the	incidence	of	neurological_complications	during	ALL	treatment	in	a	single	pediatric	institution	,	focusing	on	clinical	,	radiological	,	and	electrophysiological	findings	.	.
a8669433.s4	These	studies	suggest	that	both	phenacetin	and	acetaminophen	may	contribute	to	the	burden	of	ESRD	,	with	the	risk	of	the	latter	being	somewhat	less	than	that	of	the	former	.	.
a20698227.s0	Can	angiogenesis	be	a	target	of	treatment	for	ribavirin	associated	hemolytic_anemia	?	.
a15632880.s11	This	difference	is	explained	by	patient	comorbidities	and	more	frequent	use	of	beta	-	blockers	.	.
a2887062.s5	These	findings	suggest	that	lowered	serum	prolactin	levels	in	the	early	phase	of	bromocriptine	treatment	may	result	from	an	impaired	secretion	of	prolactin	due	to	decreasing	numbers	of	cytoplasmic	microtubules	.	.
a18261172.s5	Concomitant	IS	consisted	of	mycophenolate_mofetil	+	/-	steroids	.	.
a12627929.s6	This	4-week	cycle	was	repeated	until	there	was	evidence	of	excessive	toxicity	or	disease	progression	.	.
a16160878.s1	Urotensin	-	II	(	U	-	II	)	receptors	are	widely	distributed	in	the	central	nervous	system	.	.
a11166519.s7	Additionally	,	levels	of	cocaine	determined	in	hippocampus	and	cortex	were	not	different	between	sensitive	and	resistant	strains	.	.
a3714122.s6	These	data	indicate	that	a	critical	percentage	of	NTE	inhibition	in	brain	and	spinal	cord	sampled	shortly	after	Mipafox	exposure	can	predict	neuropathic_damage	in	rats	several	weeks	later	.	.
a1639466.s11	In	addition	,	glomerular	size	was	higher	in	the	nitrendipine	-	treated	group	(	14.9	+	/-	0.17	10(-3	)	mm2	)	but	lower	in	the	enalapril	-	treated	group	(	11.5	+	/-	0.15	10(-3	)	mm2	)	compared	with	the	hypertensive	controls	(	12.1	+	/-	0.17	10(-3	)	mm2).(ABSTRACT	TRUNCATED	AT	250	WORDS	)	.
a16330766.s6	The	dose	of	gabapentin	was	1,800	mg	per	os	,	in	a	single	administration	.	.
a9523805.s4	Accordingly	,	the	present	,	prospective	double	-	blind	study	compares	prilocaine	with	lidocaine	and	bupivacaine	with	respect	to	duration	of	action	and	relative	risk	of	TNSs	.	.
a9625142.s2	Although	the	transaminases	gradually	returned	to	baseline	after	withholding	the	beta_lactam	antibiotic	,	there	was	a	gradual	increase	in	serum	bilirubin	and	a	decrease	in	hemoglobin	concentration	caused	by	an	autoimmune_hemolytic_anemia	and	erythroblastocytopenia	.	.
a6386793.s1	In	a	6-week	double	-	blind	parallel	treatment	study	,	dothiepin	and	amitriptyline	were	compared	to	placebo	in	the	treatment	of	33	depressed	outpatients	.	.
a9653867.s1	Eating_disorders	and	the	associated	behavioural	problems	and	drug_abuse	are	uncommon	in	pregnancy	.	.
a6888657.s6	Beyond	8	days	of	DES	exposure	,	the	immunochemically	PRL	-	positive	proportion	of	cells	increased	to	over	50	%	of	the	total	population	.	.
a230316.s4	In	six	of	the	probable	cases	the	neurological_disturbance	consisted	of	an	acute	reversible	encephalopathy	usually	related	to	the	ingestion	of	a	high	dose	of	clioquinol	over	a	short	period	.	.
a19356307.s1	The	anti	-	dementia	effects	of	s	-	limonene	and	s	-	perillyl_alcohol	were	observed	using	the	passive	avoidance	test	(	PA	)	and	the	open	field	habituation	test	(	OFH	)	.	.
a11642480.s3	This	may	have	been	a	side	effect	of	citalopram	as	it	remitted	with	redistribution	of	doses	.	.
a8669433.s2	As	a	result	of	these	and	other	studies	,	phenacetin	has	now	been	withdrawn	from	the	market	in	most	countries	.	.
a11679859.s6	Akathisia	was	defined	as	either	a	spontaneous	report	of	restlessness	or	agitation	or	a	change	of	2	or	more	in	the	patient	-	reported	akathisia	rating	scale	and	a	change	of	at	least	1	in	the	investigator	-	observed	akathisia	rating	scale	.	.
a4071154.s1	We	have	reported	a	case	of	acute	oliguric	renal_failure	with	hyperkalemia	in	a	patient	with	cirrhosis	,	ascites	,	and	cor_pulmonale	after	indomethacin	therapy	.	.
a2951327.s4	The	release	rate	of	epinephrine	(	control	,	6.7	+	/-	0.6	ng	/	kg	/	min	)	declined	immediately	during	infusions	of	atrial	natriuretic	factor	to	a	minimum	of	49	+	/-	5	%	of	control	(	p	less	than	0.001	)	during	0.1	microgram	/	kg	/	min	and	to	63	+	/-	5	%	(	0.1	greater	than	p	greater	than	0.05	)	or	95	+	/-	13	%	(	not	significant	)	during	0.3	or	1.0	microgram	/	kg	/	min	.	.
a18182964.s8	Drowsiness	was	common	on	clonidine	,	but	generally	resolved	by	6	to	8	weeks	.	.
a7053303.s1	In	35	patients	(	ages	20	to	86	yr	)	receiving	cimetidine	therapeutically	two	serum	samples	and	all	urine	formed	in	the	interim	were	collected	for	analysis	of	cimetidine	by	high	-	pressure	liquid	chromatography	and	for	creatinine	.	.
a6103707.s5	The	effects	of	i.m	.	.
a3997294.s1	A	patient	with	sinuatrial_disease	and	implanted	pacemaker	was	treated	with	amiodarone	(	maximum	dose	1000	mg	,	maintenance	dose	800	mg	daily	)	for	10	months	,	for	control	of	supraventricular_tachyarrhythmias	.	.
a9334596.s24	We	now	advocate	that	before	age	50	years_testosterone	be	determined	only	in	cases	of_low_sexual_desire	and	abnormal	physical	examination	but	that	it	be	measured	in	all	men	older	than	50	years	.	.
a15458908.s3	Women	were	randomly	assigned	to	raloxifene	60	mg	/	d	or	120	mg	/	d	or	placebo	.	.

a2024540.s7	It	was	concluded	that	treatment	with	enalapril	was	well	tolerated	and	it	is	,	therefore	,	unreasonable	to	restrict	the	initiation	of	treatment	with	enalapril	to	inpatients	.	.
a16680561.s3	METHODS	,	Seventeen	subjects	who	were	genotyped	as	CYP2D6	extensive	metabolizers	were	enrolled	in	this	randomized	,	open	-	label	,	crossover	study	to	receive	a	single	oral	dose	of	desipramine	(	50	mg	)	on	two	separate	occasions	,	once	alone	and	once	after	multiple	doses	of	cinacalcet	(	90	mg	for	7	days	)	.	.
a6386793.s4	Dothiepin	also	produced	fewer	CNS	and	cardiovascular	effects	.	.

a18081909.s0	Encephalopathy	induced	by	levetiracetam	added	to	valproate	.	.
a7858459.s1	A	61-year	-	old	man	was	treated	with	combination	chemotherapy	incorporating	cisplatinum	,	etoposide	,	high	-	dose	5-fluorouracil	(	2,250	mg	/	m2/24	hours	)	and	folinic_acid	for	an	inoperable	gastric_adenocarcinoma	.	.
a7858459.s5	The	pathogenesis	of	5-fluorouracil	neurotoxicity	may	be	due	to	a	Krebs	cycle	blockade	by	fluoroacetate	and	fluorocitrate	,	thiamine	deficiency	,	or	dihydrouracil	dehydrogenase	deficiency	.	.
a8073369.s11	Control	chicks	were	in	motion	an	average	of	33.67	%	of	the	time	,	while	coniine	-	treated	chicks	were	only	moving	8.95	%	of	a	5-min	interval	,	and	no	movement	was	observed	for	nicotine	sulfate	treated	chicks	.	.
a2440413.s1	Gamma	-	hexachlorocyclohexane	(	gamma	-	HCH	)	,	the	active	ingredient	of	the	insecticide	lindane	,	has	been	shown	to	decrease	seizure	threshold	to	pentylenetrazol	(	PTZ	)	3	h	after	exposure	to	gamma	-	HCH	and	conversely	increase	threshold	to	PTZ	-	induced	seizures	24	h	after	exposure	to	gamma	-	HCH	(	Vohland	et	al	.	.
a2887062.s10	An	increase	in	the	volume	density	of	secretory	granules	and	a	decrease	in	the	volume	densities	of	rough	endoplasmic	reticulum	and	microtubules	was	determined	by	morphometric	analysis	,	suggesting	that	bromocriptine	inhibits	protein	synthesis	as	well	as	bringing	about	a	disturbance	of	the	prolactin	secretion	.	.
a7053303.s5	Rc	seemed	to	be	independent	of	age	and	decreased	with	increasing	serum	concentration	of	cimetidine	,	suggesting	that	secretion	of	cimetidine	is	a	saturable	process	.	.
a12820454.s12	The	development	of	severe	CAB	-	induced	anemia	in	prostate_cancer	patients	did	not	correlate	with	T	baseline	values	(	T	<	3	ng	/	ml	versus	T	>	or	=	3	ng	/	ml	)	,	with	age	(	<	76	yrs	versus	>	or	=	76	yrs	)	,	and	clinical	stage	(	stage	C	versus	stage	D1	)	.	.
a1992636.s6	Two	weeks	after	the	initiation	of	therapy	,	her	hematocrit	had	decreased	from	44.1	%	to	20.4	%	,	and	she	had	a	positive	direct	Coombs	antiglobulin	test	and	an	elevated	indirect	bilirubin	.	.
a15458908.s6	The	excess	event	rate	was	1.8	per	1,000	woman	-	years	(	95	%	CI	-0.5	-	4.1	)	,	and	the	number	needed	to	treat	to	cause	1	event	was	170	(	95	%	CI	100	-	582	)	over	3.3	years	.	.
a11569530.s3	TDP	is	a	side	-	effect	that	has	led	to	withdrawal	of	several	drugs	from	the	market	(	e.g.	terfenadine	and	terodiline	)	.	.
a18208574.s11	CONCLUSION	,	Higher	OD	is	associated	with	significant	risk	of	subsequent	thrombosis	in	patients	with	isolated	-	HIT	,	percent	inhibition	,	however	,	was	not	predictive	.	.
a7269015.s4	In	view	of	the	known	tendency	of	busulfan	to	induce	cellular	atypia	and	carcinoma	in	other	sites	,	periodic	urinary	cytology	is	suggested	in	patients	on	long	-	term	therapy	.	.
a8073369.s0	Effect	of	coniine	on	the	developing	chick	embryo	.	.
a1992636.s3	Although	clinical	experience	with	omeprazole	is	still	limited	,	many	controlled	studies	have	established	the	short	-	term	safety	of	this	drug	.	.
a18503483.s3	It	is	characterized	by	encephalopathy	,	headaches	,	seizures	,	or	neurological_deficits	.	.
a18081909.s4	Neuropsychological	testing	showed	impaired_word_fluency,_psychomotor_speed_and_working_memory	.	.
a3125768.s3	The	animals	were	mechanically	ventilated	to	achieve	normocarbia	(	PCO2	=	42	+	/-	1	mmHg	,	mean	+	/-	SE	)	.	.
a12627929.s0	Increased	frequency	of	venous_thromboembolism	with	the	combination	of	docetaxel	and	thalidomide	in	patients	with	metastatic	androgen	-	independent	prostate_cancer	.	.
a7453952.s3	6	h	after	the	administration	of	amiloride	,	a	reduction	was	observed	in	the	lithium	content	of	the	renal	medulla	but	not	in	the	other	organs	studied	.	.
a12615818.s5	RESULTS	,	The	age	-	adjusted	incidence	rate	ratio	for	CPA	/	EE	versus	conventional	COCs	was	2.20	[	95	%	confidence	interval	(	CI	)	1.35	-	3.58	]	.	.
a11256525.s4	Surprisingly	,	the	first	dose	of	50	mg	of	losartan	resulted	in	a	sudden	anuria	,	which	lasted	eight	hours	despite	high	-	dose	furosemide	and	amine	infusion	.	.
a3125768.s5	In	the	five	rats	that	developed	somatic_rigidity	,	ICP	and	CVP	increased	significantly	above	baseline	(	delta	ICP	7.5	+	/-	1.0	mmHg	,	delta	CVP	5.9	+	/-	1.3	mmHg	)	.	.
a15278670.s7	There	was	no	significant	difference	in	the	convulsive	threshold	between	sevoflurane	and	enflurane	.	.
a6888657.s7	Increased	density	and/or	size	and	PRL	content	were	indicated	for	the	majority	of	the	PRL	cell	population	in	both	types	of	separation	protocols	.	.
a9334596.s6	Main	clinical	criteria	tested	regarding	efficiency	in	hormone	determination	were	low_sexual_desire	,	small	testes	and	gynecomastia	.	.
a17042910.s2	Dexamethasone	(	Dex)-induced	hypertension	is	characterized	by	endothelial	dysfunction	associated	with	nitric_oxide	(	NO	)	deficiency	and	increased	superoxide	(	O2-	)	production	.	.
a1992636.s5	The	patient	developed	weakness	,	lethargy	,	and	shortness_of_breath	2	days	after	starting	therapy	with	omeprazole	.	.
a2096243.s4	Consequently	,	carmofur	-	induced	leukoencephalopathy	may	uncommonly	result	in	organic_personality_syndrome	in	the	residual	state	.	.
a6308277.s0	Reduction	in	caffeine	toxicity	by	acetaminophen	.	.
a12695819.s0	MR	imaging	with	quantitative	diffusion	mapping	of	tacrolimus	-	induced	neurotoxicity	in	organ	transplant	patients	.	.
a11679859.s4	Study	participants	were	randomized	to	receive	10	mg	of	prochlorperazine	administered	intravenously	by	means	of	2-minute	push	(	bolus	group	)	or	10	mg	diluted	in	50	mL	of	normal	saline	solution	administered	by	means	of	intravenous	infusion	during	a	15-minute	period	(	infusion	group	)	.	.
a20698227.s2	We	aimed	to	investigate	whether	there	is	a	relation	between	hemoglobin	,	haptoglobin	and	angiogenesis	soluble	markers	which	are	modifiable	and	can	help	in	developing	strategies	against	anemia	.	.
a8231633.s6	The	local	anesthetic	-	induced	mortality	was	significantly	increased	by	the	three	different	calcium	channel	blockers	.	.
a7858459.s0	Acute	confusion	induced	by	a	high	-	dose	infusion	of	5-fluorouracil	and	folinic_acid	.	.
a3560095.s3	The	most	frequently	observed	side	effect	was	fecal_occult_blood	(	25	%	of	patients	)	,	however	,	there	was	no	other	evidence	of	gastrointestinal_(GI)_bleeding	in	these	patients	.	.
a11679859.s13	The	difference	in	the	percentage	of	patients	with	a	50	%	reduction	in	their	nausea	was	12.6	%	(	95	%	CI	-4.6	%	to	29.8	%	)	.	.
a18208574.s4	Eight	of	the	isolated	-	HIT	patients	developed	thrombosis	within	the	next	30	d	,	thus	,	a	total	of	48	patients	had	thrombosis	at	day	30	.	.
a3125768.s6	These	variables	returned	to	baseline	when	rigidity	was	abolished	with	metocurine	.	.
a1639466.s7	After	6	weeks	of	therapy	,	glomerular	filtration	rate	was	not	different	among	the	studied	groups	.	.
a18221780.s5	In	males	,	the	non	-	competitive	NMDA	antagonist	dextromethorphan	enhanced	the	antihyperalgesic	effect	of	low	to	moderate	doses	of	morphine	in	a	dose	-	and	time	-	dependent	manner	.	.
a1436384.s1	LY274614	,	3SR,4aRS,6SR,8aRS-6-[phosphonomethyl]decahydr_oisoquinoline-3-_carboxylic_acid	,	has	been	described	as	a	potent	antagonist	of	the	N	-	methyl	-	D	-	aspartate	(	NMDA	)	subtype	of	glutamate	receptor	.	.
a15632880.s3	We	therefore	sought	to	determine	the	prevalence	and	clinical	associations	of	hyperkalemia	and	renal_insufficiency	in	heart_failure	patients	treated	with	spironolactone	.	.
a9334596.s2	MATERIALS	AND	METHODS	,	Testosterone	and	prolactin	were	determined	by	radioimmunoassay	.	.
a18343374.s6	MAIN	OUTCOME	MEASURE(S	)	,	Central	retinal_vein_occlusion	after	ovulation	induction	with	CC	.	.
a84204.s1	15	cases	of	cimetidine	-	associated	mental	confusion	have	been	reported	.	.
a8231633.s7	The	convulsant	activity	of	bupivacaine	was	not	significantly	modified	but	calcium	channel	blockers	decreased	the	time	of	latency	to	obtain	bupivacaine	-	induced	convulsions	,	this	effect	was	less	pronounced	with	bepridil	.	.
a18221780.s7	Enhancement	of	morphine	antinociception	by	dextromethorphan	was	seen	in	both	males	and	females	in	the	acute_pain	models	,	with	the	magnitude	of	this	effect	being	greater	in	males	.	.
a17466854.s2	SETTING	,	St.	Luke	's	Hospital	,	Gwardamangia	,	Malta	.	.
a3192036.s9	Notwithstanding	these	facts	our	findings	suggest	that	these	patients	might	benefit	from	relatively	mild	initial	treatment	,	especially	true	for	patients	not	previously	exposed	to	this	drug	.	.
a11027905.s1	Pain	not	responsive	to	morphine	is	often	problematic	.	.
a2273650.s3	These	results	suggest	that	the	facilitation	of	memory	retrieval	by	pre	-	test	morphine	might	be	the	direct	action	of	morphine	rather	than	a	state	dependent	effect	.	.
a84204.s4	The	severity	of	M.S.	changes	increased	as	trough	-	concentrations	rose	,	5	patients	had	lumbar	puncture	.	.
a16160878.s6	injections	of	U	-	II	on	behavioral	,	metabolic	,	and	endocrine	responses	in	mice	.	.
a2440413.s7	MPA	,	BCC	,	DMCM	,	and	STR	showed	no	inhibition	of	3H	-	TBOB	(	t	-	butyl_bicyclo	-	orthobenzoate	)	binding	at	concentrations	of	100	micron	.	.
a18343374.s8	A	search	of	the	literature	on	the	thromboembolic	complications	of	CC	does	not	include	this	severe	ophthalmic	complication	,	although	mild	visual_disturbance	after	CC	intake	is	not	uncommon	.	.
a11897407.s5	Histological	studies	demonstrated	that	the	rats	developed	an	infarct	18	h	after	isoproterenol	administration	.	.
a7453952.s1	The	effect	of	amiloride	on	lithium	-	induced	polydipsia	and	polyuria	and	on	the	lithium	concentration	in	the	plasma	,	brain	,	kidney	,	thyroid	and	red	blood	cells	was	investigated	in	rats	,	chronically	treated	with	LiCl	.	.

a3997294.s0	Pneumonitis	with	pleural_and_pericardial_effusion	and	neuropathy	during	amiodarone	therapy	.	.
a11027905.s12	However	,	the	occurrence	of	central	adverse	effects	should	be	taken	into	account	,	especially	when	using	higher	doses	.	.
a12627929.s9	Clinicians	should	be	aware	of	this	potential	complication	when	adding	thalidomide	to	chemotherapeutic	regimens	.	.
a7516729.s10	Also	the	enhancement	of	verapamil	effects	on	atrial	beating	was	more	pronounced	at	LNa	than	at	LCa.(ABSTRACT	TRUNCATED	AT	250	WORDS	)	.
a15458908.s7	Risk	in	the	raloxifene	group	was	higher	than	in	the	placebo	group	for	the	first	2	years	,	but	decreased	to	about	the	same	rate	as	in	the	placebo	group	thereafter	.	.
a2611118.s1	Diclofenac_sodium	(	Voltarol	,	Geigy	Pharmaceuticals	)	is	a	non	-	steroidal	anti	-	inflammatory	derivative	of	phenylacetic_acid	.	.
a7199841.s4	Of	the	20	animals	that	received	subarachnoid	injection	of	2-chloroprocaine	-	CE	seven	(	35	%	)	developed	hind	-	limb	paralysis	.	.
a16298782.s2	Aminoglycoside	antibiotics	are	still	widely	used	by	virtue	of	their	efficacy	and	low	cost	.	.
a3341566.s9	They	are	thus	more	important	during	absolute	hypovolemia	than	during	deliberate	hypotension	.	.
a8690168.s9	We	conclude	that	in	streptozotocin	-	diabetic	rats	with	an	increased	urinary	albumin	excretion	,	a	reduced	heparan_sulphate	charge	barrier	/	density	is	found	at	the	lamina	rara	externa	of	the	glomerular	basement	membrane	.	.
