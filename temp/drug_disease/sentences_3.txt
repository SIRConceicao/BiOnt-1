a88336.s7	It	is	suggested	that	in	both	situations	disturbed	reticulo	-	thalamic	interactions	are	important	in	the	pathogenesis	of	alpha	coma	.	.
a11745184.s12	RESULTS	,	Forty	-	four	patients	were	enrolled	in	the	study	of	which	7	(	16	%	)	were	ineligible	.	.
a19889778.s1	Immune	escape	variants	of	the	hepatitis	B	virus	(	HBV	)	represent	an	emerging	clinical	challenge	,	because	they	can	be	associated	with	vaccine	escape	,	HBV	reactivation	,	and	failure	of	diagnostic	tests	.	.
a19473225.s5	There	was	no	significant	difference	in	the	frequency	of	signs	or	symptoms	between	the	two	groups	although	neurotoxicity	symptoms	presented	mostly	with	lower	scores	of	severity	in	group	G.	However	,	this	difference	reached	statistical	significance	only	with	regard	to	reported	pain	sensation	(	P	=	0.011	)	.	.
a11875660.s7	It	was	found	that	the	transformation	of	exencephalic	tissue	was	not	simply	size	-	dependent	,	and	all	cases	of	anencephaly	at	E18.5	resulted	from	embryos	with	a	large	amount	of	exencephalic	tissue	at	E13.5	.	.
a7582165.s3	The	purpose	of	our	study	was	to	determine	the	cause	of	the	patients	'	reactions	,	the	immunological	mechanisms	involved	and	whether	these	patients	would	be	able	to	tolerate	any	kind	of	corticoid	.	.
a16904497.s13	She	was	unable	to	urinate	.	.
a11250767.s8	CONCLUSION	,	Pericarditis	may	be	the	initial	manifestation	of	drug	-	induced	vasculitis	attributable	to	propylthio-_uracil	therapy	.	.
a18083142.s7	In	experiments	using	specific	adrenergic	antagonists	,	we	found	that	pretreatment	with	the	beta	-	adrenergic	receptor	antagonist	propranolol	blocked	cocaine	-	induced	anxiety	-	like	behavior	in	Dbh	+	/-	and	wild	-	type	C57BL6/J	mice	,	while	the	alpha(1	)	antagonist	prazosin	and	the	alpha(2	)	antagonist	yohimbine	had	no	effect	.	.
a15145918.s4	Three	time	domain	indexes	of	hemodynamic	variability	were	employed	,	the	standard	deviation	of	mean	arterial	pressure	as	a	measure	of	blood	pressure	variability	and	the	standard	deviation	of	beat	-	to	-	beat	intervals	(	SDRR	)	and	the	root	mean	square	of	successive	differences	in	R	-	wave	-	to	-	R	-	wave	intervals	as	measures	of	heart	rate	variability	.	.
a10683478.s6	In	mice	,	apomorphine	produced	qualitatively	different	responses	under	novel	conditions	when	compared	to	those	behaviors	elicited	in	the	home	test	cage	.	.
a17241784.s7	These	observations	suggest	that	statins	may	initiate	an	immune	-	mediated	myopathy	that	persists	after	withdrawal	of	the	drug	and	responds	to	immunosuppressive	therapy	.	.
a11334364.s9	GSPE+drug	exposed	tissues	exhibited	minor	residual	damage	or	near	total	recovery	.	.
a1549199.s2	The	physician	should	also	determine	the	proper	use	of	any	adjunctive	medications	,	such	combined	therapy	has	become	the	standard	approach	to	treatment	.	.
a15899738.s3	Thyroid_disorders	,	illicit	drug	or	stimulant	use	,	and	acute_alcohol_intoxication	are	among	these	causes	.	.
a7930386.s5	For	both	experiments	the	drug	intake	led	to	significant	increases	in	PRL	secretion	,	acting	preferentially	on	tonic	secretion	as	pulse	amplitude	and	frequency	did	not	differ	significantly	from	corresponding	control	values	.	.

a2445283.s3	The	average	time	of	death	was	delayed	.	.
a9869257.s8	The	maximal	NGF	contents	obtained	by	PG-9	were	17.6-fold	of	the	control	value	.	.
a12707296.s5	Crossover	studies	were	performed	2	weeks	apart	.	.

a3101906.s3	An	analysis	of	the	75	cases	that	had	been	adequately	followed	up	suggested	that	16	,	including	three	deaths	,	were	probably	related	to	treatment	with	the	drug	.	.
a3425586.s4	Although	the	AE	RBCs	from	an	individual	not	taking	dapsone	had	increased	incubated	Heinz	body	formation	,	the	GSH	content	and	GSH	stability	were	normal	.	.
a150790.s4	A	placebo	had	no	effect	,	but	niacinamide	was	as	effective	as	pyridoxine	.	.
a20084309.s2	OBJECTIVE	,	to	analyze	aspects	of	TEE	safety	associated	to	the	use	of	Midazolan	(	MZ	)	and	Flumazenil	(	FL	)	and	the	influence	of	the	clinical	variables	on	the	event	rate	.	.
a18809400.s2	We	used	an	in	vitro	model	of	chemotherapy	induced	peripheral_neuropathy	that	closely	mimic	the	in	vivo	condition	by	exposing	primary	cultures	of	dorsal	root	ganglion	(	DRG	)	sensory	neurons	to	paclitaxel	and	cisplatin	,	two	widely	used	and	highly	effective	chemotherapeutic	drugs	.	.
a18308784.s8	The	electrophysiological	recording	in	vitro	showed	that	Rg1	restored	the	LTP	in	slices	from	the	rats	treated	with	morphine	,	but	not	changed	LTP	in	the	slices	from	normal	saline-	or	morphine	/	Rg1-treated	rats	,	this	restoration	could	be	inhibited	by	N	-	methyl	-	D	-	aspartate	(	NMDA	)	receptor	antagonist	MK801	.	.
a11263551.s6	Pain	was	not	explained	by	other	diseases	causing	foot	pain	,	like	reflex_sympathetic_dystrophy	,	polyneuropathy	,	Morton's_neuralgia	,	gout	,	osteoporosis	,	avascular_necrosis	,	intermittent_claudication	,	orthopaedic	foot_deformities	,	stress_fractures	,	and	hyperparathyroidism	.	.
a20528871.s5	Our	experience	supports	the	safety	of	giving	AraG	as	salvage	therapy	in	synchrony	with	etoposide	and	cyclophosphamide	,	although	neurological_toxicity	must	be	closely	monitored	.	.
a20633755.s1	Suxamethonium	causes	prolonged	apnea	in	patients	in	whom	pseudocholinesterase	enzyme	gets	deactivated	by	organophosphorus_(OP)_poisons	.	.
a7420681.s5	Five	of	33	(	15	%	)	of	the	tobramycin	-	treated	patients	and	16	of	29	(	55.2	%	)	of	the	gentamicin	-	treated	patients	had	renal_failure	.	.
a9390208.s9	One	patient	had	complete	response	,	seven	had	stable	disease	,	none	had	partial	response	and	five	had	progressive	disease	.	.
a15572383.s15	This	supports	the	assumption	that	differences	in	renal	ACE	activity	predispose	to	a	less	favourable	course	of	renal_damage	.	.
a12789195.s3	Pseudoacromegaly	,	on	the	other	hand	,	is	the	presence	of	similar	acromegaloid	features	in	the	absence	of	elevated	growth	hormone	or	insulin	-	like	growth	factor	levels	.	.
a8649546.s4	This	study	suggests	that	administration	of	low	doses	of	beta	-	blockers	may	improve	levodopa	-	induced	ballistic	and	choreic	dyskinesia	in	PD	.	.
a9100294.s2	The	present	study	was	designed	to	investigate	the	hypothesis	that	calcium	channel	blockers	in	general	induce	cardiovascular_malformations	indicating	a	pharmacologic	class	effect	.	.
a8638206.s4	We	report	a	case	of	atracurium	-	related	paralysis	persisting	for	approximately	50	hours	in	a	patient	who	was	not	treated	with	corticosteroids	.	.
a11532387.s4	The	symptom	was	treated	successfully	with	trihexyphenidyl	anticholinergic	therapy	.	.
a6640832.s13	The	beneficial	effect	of	Adriamycin	appears	obvious	and	might	be	related	to	the	drug	itself	,	the	early	and	repeated	instillations	after	TUR	,	or	both	.	.
a18442015.s3	Additionally	,	the	protective	effect	of	verapamil	on	this	ulcer	model	was	evaluated	.	.

a16330293.s10	Five	hundred	fifty	-	three	patients	,	264	taking	the	lozenge	and	289	taking	the	gum	,	used	the	study	product	for	>	or	=	4	days	per	week	during	the	first	2	weeks	(	evaluable	population	)	.	.
a17612891.s3	RESULTS	,	A	20-year	-	old	male	with	schizophrenia	developed	a	sudden	onset	of	myocarditis	after	commencement	of	clozapine	.	.
a2224762.s0	A	phase	I	study	of	4'-0-tetrahydropyranyladriamycin	.	Clinical	pharmacology	and	pharmacokinetics	.	.
a15188772.s2	In	contrast	,	reports	of	myocardial_dysfunction	due	to	acute	iatrogenic	overdose	are	rare	.	.
a11007689.s6	With	the	more	widespread	application	of	tacrolimus	in	organ	transplantation	,	tacrolimus	-	associated	TMA	has	also	been	recognized	.	.
a11279304.s10	On	the	other	hand	,	BNP	did	not	increase	in	the	patients	without	heart_failure	given	DNR	,	even	at	more	than	700	mg	/	m(2	)	.	.
a10579464.s6	NRA0160	and	clozapine	significantly	induced	catalepsy	in	rats	,	although	their	effects	did	not	exceed	50	%	induction	even	at	the	highest	dose	given	.	.
a17919553.s12	Recurrence	of	hepatitis	attack	might	have	been	avoided	if	the	initial	incident	had	been	communicated	to	the	attending	physician	who	prescribed	telithromycin	the	second	time	.	.
a983936.s1	A	reproducible	model	for	producing	diffuse	myocardial_injury	(	epinephrine	infusion	)	has	been	developed	to	study	the	cardioprotective	effects	of	agents	or	maneuvers	which	might	alter	the	evolution	of	acute	myocardial_infarction	.	.
a8595686.s9	Recovery	room	discharge	times	were	similar	,	C	(	75.9	+	/-	19.4	min	)	,	L	73.6	+	/-	21.6	min	)	,	T	(	77.1	+	/-	18.9	min	)	.	.
a9766615.s2	Thus	,	clinicians	should	address	patients	'	concerns	about	adverse	effects	and	attempt	to	choose	medications	that	will	improve	their	patients	'	quality	of	life	as	well	as	overall	health	.	.
a12536034.s2	Despite	the	underlying	diseases	,	the	prognosis	for	drug	-	induced	de	novo	absence_seizure	is	good	because	it	subsides	rapidly	after	discontinuing	the	use	of	the	offending	drugs	.	.
a14596845.s2	The	present	study	examined	whether	female	rats	on	various	regimens	of	sugar	access	would	show	behavioral_cross	-	sensitization	to	a	low	dose	of	amphetamine	.	.
a1867351.s5	The	incidence	calculation	revealed	that	one	of	215	therapeutic	users	had	reactions	,	compared	with	one	of	13,000	in	the	prophylaxis	group	,	making	the	risk	of	neuropsychiatric	reactions	after	mefloquine	treatment	60	times	higher	than	after	prophylaxis	.	.
a9522143.s7	None	of	the	patients	complained	of	subjective	hearing_loss	.	.
a12536034.s7	By	understanding	the	underlying	mechanism	of	absence_epilepsy	,	we	can	avoid	the	inappropriate	use	of	anticonvulsants	in	children	with	epilepsy	and	prevent	drug	-	induced	absence_seizures	.	.
a9862868.s5	We	used	rat	models	of	intrahepatic_cholestasis	by	ethinyl_estradiol	(	EE	)	treatment	and	extrahepatic_cholestasis	by	bile	duct	ligation	(	BDL	)	to	precisely	determine	the	site	of	TJ	damage	.	.
a16867021.s16	reduced	locomotor	time	,	distance	traveled	and	average	speed	(	P	<	0.05	)	.	.

a16867021.s18	could	partially	reverse	such	effects	of_THP	(	3.75	mg	/	kg	i.p	.	)	.	.
a9721172.s0	Drug	-	associated	acute	-	onset	vanishing_bile_duct	and	Stevens	-	Johnson_syndromes	in	a	child	.	.
a9100294.s5	A	low	incidence	of	cardiovascular_malformations	was	observed	after	exposure	to	each	of	the	four	calcium	channel	blockers	,	but	this	incidence	was	statistically	significant	only	for	verapamil	and	nifedipine	.	.
a6534871.s2	The	rats	were	trained	to	swim	for	a	specific	duration	and	for	a	particular	period	.	.
a17400887.s6	Immunohistochemical	studies	showed	that	administration	of	terbutaline	on	PN	2	to	5	produced	a	robust	increase	in	microglial	activation	on	PN	30	in	the	cerebral	cortex	,	as	well	as	in	cerebellar	and	cerebrocortical	white	matter	.	.
a7234705.s2	In	four	patients	,	polymorphous	ventricular_tachycardia	appeared	after	intravenous	administration	of	200	to	400	mg	of	procainamide	for	the	treatment	of	sustained	ventricular_tachycardia	.	.
a17439425.s11	Dex	increased_SBP	(	110	+	/-	2	-	126	+	/-	3	mmHg	,	P	<	0.001	)	and	decreased_thymus_(P_<_0.001)_and_bodyweights	(	P	"	<	0.01	)	.	.
a9522143.s2	Up	until	now	,	the	only	factor	studied	has	been	the	effect	of	the	diameter	of	the	spinal	needle	on	post	-	operative	sensorineural_hearing_loss	.	.
a8372922.s9	The	results	indicate	that	the	deprived	area	of	A1	undergoes	extensive	reorganization	and	becomes	responsive	to	intact	cochlear	frequencies	.	.
a9869257.s7	PG-9	was	also	able	to	increase	the	amount	of	NGF	secreted	in	vitro	by	astrocytes	in	a	dose	-	dependent	manner	.	.
a1664218.s7	1	patient	with	squamous_cell_carcinoma	achieved	a	partial	response	lasting	5	months	.	.
a8739323.s6	Following	polytherapy	according	to	the	CMF	regimen	,	a	statistically	significant	decrease	(	p	=	0.0343	)	in	creatinine	clearance	was	found	,	but	creatinine	concentration	did	not	increase	significantly	compared	to	controls	.	.
a6209318.s6	The	incidence	of	coronary	events	was	similar	in	both	groups	.	.
a15338796.s12	RESULTS	,	Salbutamol	significantly	increased	tremor	severity	in	patients	in	a	dose	-	dependent	way	.	.
a18020536.s11	Two	or	three	BZDs	/	RDs	were	concomitantly	taken	by	26	%	of	users	(	n	=	20	)	.	.
a11279304.s11	The	plasma	level	of	ANP	did	not	always	increase	in	all	the	patients	with	clinical	and	subclinical	heart_failure	.	.
a6640832.s11	In	patients	that	were	free	of	recurrence	during	the	first	year	,	80	%	remained	tumor	-	free	during	the	2-	to	3-year	follow	-	up	period	.	.
a12584269.s1	BACKGROUND	,	Sirolimus	(	SRL	)	may	supplement	calcineurin	inhibitors	in	clinical	organ	transplantation	.	.
a16740173.s6	Carbachol	concentrations	in	serum	and	urine	on	day	1	and	2	of	hospital	admission	were	analysed	by	HPLC	-	mass	spectrometry	.	.
a12905102.s1	BACKGROUND	,	Incidence	and	risk	factors	for	delirium	during	clozapine	treatment	require	further	clarification	.	.
a19037603.s6	Baseline	,	liver	function	tests	were	elevated	in	two	patients	(	fourth	patient	,	ALT,122	IU	/	l	,	AST,111	IU	/	l	,	tenth	patient	,	ALT,294	IU	/	l	,	AST,274	IU	/	l	,	with	minimal	changes	in	the	liver	biopsy	in	both	)	.	.
a11250767.s6	Propylthiouracil	therapy	was	withdrawn	,	and	she	was	treated	with	a	1-month	course	of	prednisone	,	which	alleviated	her	symptoms	.	.
a18560792.s10	Severity	of	regurgitation	was	not	correlated	with	pergolide	cumulative	dose	.	.
a3970039.s8	There	have	been	several	long	-	term	studies	of	patients	with	rheumatoid_arthritis	treated	with	azathioprine	and	cyclophosphamide	and	the	incidence	of	most	of	the	common	cancers	is	not	increased	.	.
a8387218.s10	Peripheral_neuropathy	occurred	in	12	patients	and	pancreatitis	in	six	.	.
a19346865.s4	Initial	brain	magnetic	resonance	imaging	(	MRI	)	were	obtained	after	the	hospitalization	,	including	DWI	(	8/8	)	,	apparent	diffusion	coefficient	(	ADC	)	map	(	4/8	)	,	FLAIR	(	7/8	)	,	and	T2-weighted	image	(	8/8	)	.	.
a12617329.s5	It	could	be	inferred	that	gum_Arabic	treatment	has	induced	a	modest	amelioration	of	some	of	the	histological	and	biochemical	indices	of	GM	nephrotoxicity	.	.
a18951540.s4	However	,	comparison	with	the	baseline	showed	small	but	significant	reduction	in	dyskinesia	severity	following	real	rTMS	but	not	placebo	.	.
a20588063.s7	The	amount	of	nephrin	was	reduced	in	both	diseased	and	normal	areas	.	.
a12653683.s5	The	time	courses	of	urinary	sodium	excretion	,	plasma	aldosterone	concentration	and	proteinuria	were	studied	in	male	Sprague	-	Dawley	rats	treated	with	a	single	dose	of	either	PAN	or	vehicle	.	.
a15859940.s9	The	fifth	case	had	features	of	thrombotic_microangiopathy	related	to	an	antiphospholipid_syndrome	in	a	patient	with	systemic_lupus_erythematosus	.	.
a20067456.s6	RESULTS	,	After	12	weeks	of	treatment	,	the	mean	(	sd	)	scores	for	CGI	-	SF	were	significantly	lower	,	i.e.	better	,	in	patients	on	bupropion	SR	,	at	2.4	(	1.2	)	,	than	in	the	placebo	group	,	at	3.9	(	1.1	)	(	P=	0.01	)	.	.
a19346865.s8	High	-	signal	intensity	lesions	on	DWI	tended	to	show	low	signal	intensity	on	ADC	map	(	3/4	)	,	but	in	one	patient	,	high	signal	intensity	was	shown	at	bilateral	dentate	nuclei	on	not	only	DWI	but	also	ADC	map	.	.
a1835291.s5	While	side	effects	were	rare	,	those	experienced	after	theophylline	use	did	involve	the	cardiovascular_and_gastrointestinal_systems	.	.
a7890216.s10	In	conclusion	,	octreotide	induced	gall_stones	are	generally	small	,	multiple	,	and	cholesterol	rich	although	,	in	common	with	spontaneous	gall_stone_disease	,	at	presentation	some	patients	will	have	a	blocked	cystic	duct	and	some	gall_stones	containing	calcium	.	.

a983936.s11	Evidence	of	microscopic	damage	was	graded	as	less	severe	in	the	three	treatment	groups	.	.
a220563.s5	The	underlying	mechanism	causing	the	neuropathy	is	not	yet	fully	known	,	although	some	evidence	indicates	that	it	may	be	a	lipid	storage	process	.	.
a11807648.s8	FINDINGS	,	FS	containing	tAMCA	caused	paroxysmal	brain	activity	which	was	associated	with	distinct	convulsive	behaviours	.	.
a1835291.s4	The	mean	duration	of	action	was	3.8	hours	with	ipratropium	and	2.4	hours	with	theophylline	.	.
a16904497.s6	Spread	of	the	contrast	medium	within	the	epidural	space	was	determined	by	radiographic	imaging	.	.
a18754075.s5	This	report	demonstrates	that	not	only	intravenous	,	but	also	oral	bisphosphonates	can	aggravate	proteinuria	and	acute_renal_failure	.	.
a11279304.s8	Five	patients	were	diagnosed	as	having	subclinical	heart_failure	after	the	completion	of	chemotherapy	.	.
a20080983.s9	Comparison	of	slow	-	wave	sleep	time	,	total	sleep	time	,	and	sleep	latency	in	cocaine	-	dependent	and	healthy	participants	revealed	a	normalizing	effect	of	modafinil	in	cocaine	-	dependent	participants	.	.
a16574712.s3	Fifteen	polydrug	ecstasy	users	and	15	polydrug	non	-	ecstasy	user	controls	completed	a	general	drug	use	questionnaire	,	the	Brixton	Spatial	Anticipation	task	(	set	shifting	)	,	Backward	Digit	Span	procedure	(	memory	updating	)	,	Inhibition	of	Return	(	inhibition	)	,	an	emotional	intelligence	scale	,	the	Tromso	Social	Intelligence	Scale	and	the	Dysexecutive	Questionnaire	(	DEX	)	.	.
a3856631.s3	Leucovorin	rescue	was	initiated	12	hours	after	the	end	of	the	infusion	with	a	loading	dose	of	200	mg	/	m2	followed	by	12	mg	/	m2	every	three	hours	for	six	doses	and	then	every	six	hours	until	the	plasma	methotrexate	level	decreased	to	less	than	1	X	10(-7	)	mol	/	L.	The	mean	steady	-	state	plasma	and	CSF	methotrexate	concentrations	achieved	were	1.1	X	10(-3	)	mol	/	L	and	3.6	X	10(-5	)	mol	/	L	,	respectively	.	.
a8386779.s4	papaverine	,	100	micrograms	.	.
a17879945.s13	E2	did	,	however	,	significantly	suppress	CD36	protein	levels	as	measured	by	fluorescent	immunocytochemistry	.	.
a17147461.s10	Although	these	adverse	effects	occur	in	some	patients	,	their	occurrence	could	be	minimised	by	knowledge	of	the	molecular	effects	of	sirolimus	on	the	kidney	,	the	use	of	sirolimus	in	appropriate	patient	populations	,	close	monitoring	of	proteinuria	and	renal	function	,	use	of	angiotensin	-	converting	enzyme	inhibitors	or	angiotensin_II	receptor	blockers	if	proteinuria	occurs	and	withdrawal	if	needed	.	.
a20477932.s2	Nuclear	factor	kappa	B	(	NFkappaB	)	is	a	sensor	of	oxidative	stress	and	participates	in	memory	formation	that	could	be	involved	in	drug	toxicity	and	addiction	mechanisms	.	.
a19269743.s10	Correlation	with	rating	recall	after	one	week	was	best	when	first	-	time	ratings	were	requested	as	late	as	one	day	after	injection	(	R(2)=0.79	)	indicating	that	both	rating	retrievals	utilized	similar	memory	traces	.	.
a10193204.s8	These	results	suggest	that	antithrombosis	of	TET	and	FAN	in	mice	may	be	mainly	related	to	the	antiplatelet	aggregation	activities	.	.
a19445921.s9	The	protective	role	of	salvianolic_acid	A	against	isoproterenol	-	induced	myocardial_damage	was	further	confirmed	by	histopathological	examination	.	.
a11334364.s8	Histopathological	examination	of	kidney	,	heart	and	lung	sections	revealed	moderate	to	massive	tissue_damage	with	a	variety	of	morphological	aberrations	by	all	the	three	drugs	in	the	absence	of	GSPE	preexposure	than	in	its	presence	.	.

a15859940.s10	CONCLUSIONS	,	In	the	literature	,	the	most	-	frequent	cause	of	hemolytic_uremic_syndrome	in	patients	following	renal	transplantation	is	recurrence	of	the	hemolytic_uremic_syndrome	.	.
a12523465.s5	None	of	the	patients	had	experienced	visual_hallucinations	before	this	event	.	.
a11426838.s7	In	contrast	to	the	protection	provided	by	the	putative	antagonists	,	the	well	-	characterized	sigma	receptor	agonist	di	-	o	-	tolylguanidine	(	DTG	)	and	the	novel	sigma	receptor	agonist	BD1031	(	3R-1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-1,4-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane	)	each	worsened	the	behavioral	toxicity	of	cocaine	.	.
a3970039.s9	Data	on	the	possible	increased	risk	of	malignancy	in	rheumatoid_arthritis	are	still	being	collected	,	and	until	further	information	is	available	,	the	use	of	immunosuppressive	drugs	,	particularly	alkylating_agents	,	in	the	treatment	of	rheumatoid_arthritis	should	be	reserved	for	patients	with	severe	progressive	disease	or	life	-	threatening	complications	.	.

a12464714.s4	Faster	relief	of	headache	was	the	most	important	reason	for	preference	,	cited	by	67.3	%	of	patients	preferring	rizatriptan	and	54.2	%	of	patients	who	preferred	ergotamine	/	caffeine	.	.
a10721819.s5	Bromocriptine	-	induced	hypotension	was	unaffected	by	isoproterenol	pretreatment	,	while	tachycardia	was	reversed	to	significant	bradycardia	,	an	effect	that	was	partly	reduced	by	i.v	.	.
a16274958.s1	We	report	the	case	of	a	woman	complaining	of	dysphonia	while	she	was	treated	by	acitretin	.	.
a15859940.s12	We	found	that	the	most	-	frequent	cause	of	thrombotic_microangiopathy	was	drug	related	,	secondary	mainly	to	cyclosporine	.	.
a18162529.s13	They	also	provide	evidence	for	estradiol	-	dependent	and	brain	region	-	specific	regulation	of	PRL	-	R	expression	and	signaling	responses	by	prolactin	.	.

a19356053.s7	Laboratory	results	were	compared	between	prior	,	during	and	following	sirolimus	use	.	.
a2445283.s5	From	these	results	,	we	conclude	that	ribavirin	has	an	antiviral	effect	in	advanced	cases	of	AHF	,	and	that	anemia	,	the	only	secondary	reaction	observed	,	can	be	easily	managed	.	.
a9869257.s4	In	the	same	experimental	conditions	,	PG-9	(	5	-	20	microg	per	mouse	,	i.c.v	.	)	.
a17147461.s11	Further	long	-	term	analysis	of	renal	allograft	studies	using	sirolimus	as	de	novo	immunosuppression	along	with	clinical	and	laboratory	studies	will	refine	these	issues	in	the	future	.	.

a10669626.s14	Because	Warfarin	treatment	had	no	effect	on	the	elevation	in	serum	calcium	produced	by	vitamin	D	,	the	synergy	between	Warfarin	and	vitamin	D	is	probably	best	explained	by	the	hypothesis	that	Warfarin	inhibits	the	activity	of	matrix	Gla	protein	as	a	calcification	inhibitor	.	.
a10669626.s7	Although	the	explanation	for	the	association	between	artery_calcification	and	growth	status	can	not	be	determined	from	the	present	study	,	there	was	a	relationship	between	higher	serum	phosphate	and	susceptibility	to	artery_calcification	,	with	30	%	higher	levels	of	serum	phosphate	in	young	,	ad	libitum	-	fed	rats	compared	with	either	of	the	groups	that	was	resistant	to	Warfarin	-	induced	artery_calcification	,	ie	,	the	10-month	-	old	rats	and	the	restricted	-	diet	,	growth	-	inhibited	young	rats	.	.
