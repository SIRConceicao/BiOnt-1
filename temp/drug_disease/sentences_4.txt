a11928786.s3	In	the	initial	6	months	since	it	's	introduction	,	12	overdose	cases	have	been	reported	to	The	National	Poisons	Information	Centre	.	.
a15338796.s6	Subjects	were	asked	to	aim	at	the	centre	of	a	target	,	subdivided	in	concentric	circles	,	from	5	m	distance	.	.
a16904497.s17	CONCLUSION	,	Complications	associated	with	epidural	steroid	injections	are	rare	.	.
a12639165.s1	OBJECTIVE	,	To	report	2	cases	of	ticlopidine	-	induced	cholestatic_hepatitis	,	investigate	its	mechanism	,	and	compare	the	observed	main	characteristics	with	those	of	the	published	cases	.	.
a7292072.s0	Variant	ventricular_tachycardia	in	desipramine	toxicity	.	.
a9727773.s8	The	patients	who	had	been	exposed	to	appetite_suppressants	tended	to	be	on	average	more	severely	ill	,	and	to	have	a	shorter	median	delay	between	onset	of	symptoms	and	diagnosis	.	.
a20098969.s7	She	reported	her	use	of	methamphetamine	for	five	years	and	had	not	experienced	any	major	carious_episodes	before	she	started	using	the	drug	.	.
a9495837.s2	30	-	60	mg	kg-1	p.o	.	,	.
a17532790.s5	In	the	present	study	,	we	investigated	the	changes	occurring	at	the	protein	level	in	striatal	samples	obtained	from	the	unilaterally	6-hydroxydopamine	-	lesion	rat	model	of	PD	treated	with	saline	,	L	-	DOPA	or	bromocriptine	using	two	-	dimensional	difference	gel	electrophoresis	and	mass	spectrometry	(	MS	)	.	.
a19346865.s3	They	had	been	taking	metronidazole	(	total	dosage	,	45	-	120	g	,	duration	,	30	days	to	2	months	)	to	treat	the	infection	in	various	organs	.	.
a1720453.s2	Total	cumulative	doses	were	36	or	60	g	/	m2	of	ifosfamide	(	six	or	10	cycles	of	ifosfamide,_vincristine,_and_dactinomycin	[	IVA	]	)	.	.
a10091617.s0	Selegiline	-	induced	postural_hypotension	in	Parkinson's_disease	,	a	longitudinal	study	on	the	effects	of	drug	withdrawal	.	.
a16740173.s4	The	mode	of	action	was	said	to	be	comparable	to	that	of	the	synthetic	compound	'	carbamylcholin	'	,	that	is	,	carbachol	.	.
a19269743.s5	Subjects	also	recalled	their	pains	one	week	later	.	.
a17639754.s3	While	small	prospective	studies	have	not	revealed	any	significant	drug	-	drug	interaction	between	warfarin	and	levofloxacin	,	several	case	reports	have	indicated	that	levofloxacin	may	significantly	potentiate	the	anticoagulation	effect	of	warfarin	.	.
a3437726.s6	Two	days	before	admission	diltiazem	(	60	mg	b.i.d	.	)	.
a17437408.s4	However	,	one	drawback	of	such	studies	in	genetically	deficient	rats	is	the	fact	that	compensatory	changes	with	upregulation	of	other	transporters	can	occur	.	.
a2054792.s7	Thus	,	while	whole	body	hyperthermia	enhances	Adriamycin	-	mediated	antitumor	effect	,	normal	tissue	toxicity	is	also	increased	,	and	the	potential	therapeutic	gain	of	the	combined	modality	treatment	is	eroded	.	.
a9855119.s2	METHODS	,	Twenty	-	six	renal	allograft	biopsy	specimens	from	1	9	renal	transplant	patients	who	underwent	transplantations	between	1991	and	1993	were	evaluated	.	.
a9587734.s6	Apart	from	the	reduction	in	the	patient	's	level	of	consciousness	,	there	were	no	signs	of	motor	neurone	damage	or	of	any	of	the	other	known	predisposing	conditions	for	hyperkalaemia	following	the	administration	of	suxamethonium	.	.
a16330293.s2	The	increased	nicotine	exposure	from	the	lozenge	has	raised	questions	about	the	relative	safety	of	the	lozenge	and	gum	.	.
a3425586.s7	Given	the	influx	of	Southeast	Asians	into	the	United	States	,	oxidant	medications	should	be	used	with	caution	,	especially	if	an	infection	is	present	,	in	individuals	of	ethnic	backgrounds	that	have	an	increased	prevalence	of	hemoglobin	E.	.
a11250767.s5	Serologic	evaluation	revealed	the	presence	of	perinuclear	-	staining	antineutrophil	cytoplasmic	autoantibodies	(	pANCA	)	against	myeloperoxidase	(	MPO	)	.	.
a20084309.s1	BACKGROUND	,	TEE	is	a	semi	-	invasive	tool	broadly	used	and	its	utilization	associated	to	sedatives	drugs	might	to	affect	the	procedure	safety	.	.

a18768591.s4	To	this	end	,	doxorubicin	(	15	mug	/	g	body	wt	)	was	injected	intravenously	into	gene	-	targeted	mice	lacking	SGK1	(	sgk1(-/-	)	)	and	their	wild	-	type	littermates	(	sgk1(+/+	)	)	.	.
a137340.s2	The	subcutaneous	administration	of	10	mg	/	kg	of	morphine	-	HC1	produced	a	marked	increase_in_locomotor_activity	in	mice	.	.
a19843802.s5	The	catheters	were	changed	,	and	hemodynamics	stabilized	at	lower	catecholamine	doses	.	.
a19657887.s0	Disulfiram	-	like	syndrome	after	hydrogen_cyanamide	professional	skin	exposure	,	two	case	reports	in	France	.	.
a12757899.s3	Rats	received	subcutaneous	injections	of	17beta	-	estradiol	(	2	microg	/	rat	)	or	oil	once	daily	for	four	consecutive	days	.	.
a88336.s1	Four	patients	who	were	rendered	comatose	or	stuporous	by	drug	intoxication	,	but	who	were	not	hypoxic	,	are	described	.	.
a2425813.s3	It	is	suggested	that	the	drug	acted	in	a	selective	and	tissue	-	specific	manner	to	enhance	ribosomal	RNA	synthesis	in	the	liver	and	depress	such	synthesis	in	the	muscle	.	.
a9721172.s1	Acute	vanishing_bile_duct	syndrome	is	a	rare	but	established	cause	of	progressive	cholestasis	in	adults	,	is	most	often	drug	or	toxin	related	,	and	is	of	unknown	pathogenesis	.	.
a8752018.s0	Lithium	-	associated	cognitive_and_functional_deficits	reduced	by	a	switch	to	divalproex_sodium	,	a	case	series	.	.
a3403780.s0	Paracetamol	-	associated	coma	,	metabolic_acidosis	,	renal_and_hepatic_failure	.	.
a10835440.s14	These	results	do	not	confirm	or	exclude	a	neuroprotective	property	of	nimodipine	.	.
a12653683.s2	The	molecular	mechanism(s	)	leading	to	salt	retention	has	not	been	completely	elucidated	.	.
a809711.s3	Ten	patients	with	acute	transmural	myocardial_infarctions	received	intravenous	nitroglycerin	,	sufficient	to	reduce	mean	arterial	pressure	from	107	+	/-	6	to	85	+	/-	6	mm	Hg	(	P	less	than	0.001	)	,	for	60	minutes	.	.
a2505783.s2	The	data	demonstrate	that	CAA	after	i.v	.	.
a1967484.s2	Although	initially	thought	to	be	free	of	extrapyramidal	side	effects	,	sulpiride	-	induced	tardive_dyskinesia	and	parkinsonism	have	been	reported	occasionally	.	.
a10669626.s10	High	doses	of	vitamin	D	are	known	to	cause	calcification_of_the_artery	media	in	as	little	as	3	to	4	days	.	.
a19269743.s2	Systematic	investigations	of	the	human	capacity	to	remember	sensory	features	of	experimental	pain	are	sparse	.	.
a2304736.s5	Her	incontinence	resolved	with	the	change	of	medication	.	.
a2505783.s1	Based	on	clinical	data	,	indicating	that	chloroacetaldehyde	(	CAA	)	is	an	important	metabolite	of	oxazaphosphorine	cytostatics	,	an	experimental	study	was	carried	out	in	order	to	elucidate	the	role	of	CAA	in	the	development	of	hemorrhagic_cystitis	.	.
a14659530.s7	In	addition	,	both	change	and	peak	,	showed	significant	positive	correlations	with	migraine	headache	intensity	(	P<0.001	)	.	.
a16938416.s9	CONCLUSION	,	Our	results	suggest	that	high	-	dose	testosterone	therapy	may	adversely	affect	atherosclerosis	in	postmenopausal	women	and	indicate	that	androgen	replacement	in	these	women	may	not	be	harmless	.	.
a12921865.s4	Allopregnanolone	(	3alpha	-	hydroxy-5alpha	-	pregnan-20-one	)	,	pregnanolone	(	3alpha	-	hydroxy-5beta	-	pregnan-20-one	)	and	ganaxolone	(	a	synthetic	derivative	of	allopregnanolone	3alpha	-	hydroxy-3beta	-	methyl-5alpha	-	pregnan-20-one	)	were	tested	for	their	ability	to	suppress	the	expression	(	anticonvulsant	effect	)	and	development	(	antiepileptogenic	effect	)	of	cocaine	-	kindled	seizures	in	male	,	Swiss	-	Webster	mice	.	.
a19308880.s3	We	performed	this	study	in	order	to	describe	the	main	characteristics	of	this	adverse	drug	reaction	.	.
a17343925.s9	However	,	by	comparing	each	subgroup	to	control	group	,	we	found	statistically	significant	decreases_of_TEOAEs_amplitudes	at	4000Hz	for	all	three	groups	.	.
a11773892.s1	BACKGROUND	,	The	calcineurin	inhibitors	cyclosporine	and	tacrolimus	are	both	known	to	be	nephrotoxic	.	.
a18020536.s10	RESULTS	,	The	mean	+	/-	SD	duration	of	BZD	/	RD	use	was	7	+	/-	7	years	(	range	1	-	31	)	.	.
a12464714.s10	More	patients	were	(	completely	,	very	or	somewhat	)	satisfied	2	h	after	treatment	with	rizatriptan	(	69.8	%	)	than	at	2	h	after	treatment	with	ergotamine	/	caffeine	(	38.6	%	,	p	<	or	=	0.001	)	.	.
a347884.s7	The	results	of	detailed	laboratory	tests	and	evaluations	of	various	quantitative	and	qualitative	tolerability	parameters	were	not	indicative	of	toxic	effects	.	.

a12523465.s0	Visual_hallucinations	associated	with	zonisamide	.	.
a1428568.s1	Depression	and	sexual_dysfunction	have	been	related	to	side	effects	of	topical	beta	-	blockers	.	.
a12523465.s2	Although	visual_hallucinations	have	not	been	reported	as	an	adverse	effect	of	this	agent	,	we	describe	three	patients	who	experienced	complex	visual_hallucinations	and	altered	mental	status	after	zonisamide	treatment	was	begun	or	its	dosage	increased	.	.
a424937.s5	Most	patients	showed	moderate	to	severe	acute_hepatitis	or	chronic_active_hepatitis	with	associated	cholestasis	.	.

a15188772.s4	Our	case	illustrates	the	serious	consequences	of	medical	errors	that	can	be	avoided	through	improved	medication	labeling	and	staff	supervision	.	.
a11752354.s6	Among	women	who	used	oral_contraceptives	,	the	odds	ratio	was	2.1	(	95	percent	confidence	interval	,	1.5	to	3.0	)	for	those	without	a	prothrombotic	mutation	and	1.9	(	95	percent	confidence	interval	,	0.6	to	5.5	)	for	those	with	a	mutation	CONCLUSIONS	,	The	risk	of	myocardial_infarction	was	increased	among	women	who	used	second	-	generation	oral_contraceptives	.	.
a16167916.s3	Twenty	-	five	women	were	given	raloxifene_hydrochloride	(	60	mg	/	day	)	plus	calcium	(	500	mg	/	day	)	.	.
a18439803.s3	In	vivo	microdialysis	demonstrated	that	an	intraperitoneal	administration	of	pilocarpine	induced	a	pronounced	increment	of	hippocampal	glutamate	and	aspartate	whereas	no	significant	change	was	observed	on	the	level	of	glycine	and	GABA	.	.
a3800626.s1	Fibrous_myopathy	is	a	common	,	well	-	known	side	effect	of	repeated	pentazocine	injection	.	.
a16337777.s2	Increased	production	of	FRs	may	cause	mtDNA	damage	leading	to	decreased	activities	of	oxidative	phosphorylation	complexes	containing	mtDNA	-	encoded	subunits	.	.
a12684739.s2	This	non	-	receptor	mediated	inhibition	requires	de	novo	synthesis	for	restoration	of	functional	GABA	catabolism	.	.
a15863244.s2	Unlike	general	toxicity	data	,	their	prenatal	toxic	effects	were	not	extensively	studied	before	.	.
a18308784.s2	Previous	studies	have	demonstrated	that	Rg1	might	be	a	useful	agent	for	the	prevention	and	treatment	of	the	adverse	effects	of	morphine	.	.
a8741744.s1	Partial	lesions	were	made	with	kainic_acid	in	the	interpeduncular	nucleus	of	the	ventral	midbrain	of	the	rat	.	.
a10743446.s7	Ketamine	reduced	both	the	area	of	brush	-	evoked	and	punctate	-	evoked	hyperalgesia	significantly	and	it	tended	to	reduce	brush	-	evoked	pain	.	.
a18442015.s6	After	gastric	surgery	,	rat	stomachs	were	irrigated	for	3	h	with	either	simulated	gastric	juice	or	normal	saline	.	.
a322550.s8	During	nitroprusside	infusion	low	levels	of	CPAP	do	not	markedly	alter	cardiovascular	dynamics	,	but	high	levels	of	CPAP	(	10	cm	H2O	)	,	while	decreasing	QS	/	QT	,	produce	marked	decreases_in_arterial_blood_pressure_and_cardiac_output	.	.
a14596845.s8	These	results	suggest	that	a	diet	comprised	of	alternating	deprivation	and	access	to	a	sugar	solution	and	chow	produces	bingeing	on	sugar	that	leads	to	a	long	lasting	state	of	increased	sensitivity	to	amphetamine	,	possibly	due	to	a	lasting	alteration	in	the	dopamine	system	.	.
a2265898.s2	The	first	patient	died	without	a	diagnosis	,	the	second	patient	had	a	dramatic	recovery	following	the	administration	of	vitamin_B6	.	.
a17020434.s3	Overall	,	in	high	-	risk	patients	,	warfarin	is	superior	to	aspirin	in	preventing	strokes	,	with	a	relative	risk	reduction	of	36	%	.	.
a10835440.s3	METHODS	,	Patients	with	a	clinical	diagnosis	of	ischemic_stroke	(	within	24	hours	)	were	consecutively	allocated	to	receive	placebo	(	n=100	)	,	1	mg	/	h	(	low	-	dose	)	nimodipine	(	n=101	)	,	or	2	mg	/	h	(	high	-	dose	)	nimodipine	(	n=94	)	.	.
a11379838.s7	In	contrast	,	mood	switches	were	less	frequent	in	patients	receiving	lithium	(	15	%	,	4/26	)	than	in	patients	not	treated	with	lithium	(	44	%	,	8/18	,	p	=	.04	)	.	.
a8170551.s3	Three	patients	on	acetazolamide	(	15	%	)	developed	renal_calculi	.	.
a9727773.s7	In	8	patients	the	diagnosis	of	primary_pulmonary_hypertension	was	uncertain	,	5	of	them	had	taken	appetite_suppressants	.	.

a20619828.s6	CONCLUSIONS	,	This	is	the	first	demonstration	of	multiple	symptoms	consistent	with	an	OCD	-	like	profile	in	animals	.	.
a11334364.s14	Additionally	,	this	may	have	been	the	first	report	on	AMI	-	induced	apoptotic	death	in	the	lung	tissue	.	.
a20588063.s8	The	other	proteins	showed	few	changes	,	which	were	limited	to	diseased	areas	.	.
a18560792.s2	However	,	the	incidence	and	severity	of	these	abnormalities	vary	from	study	to	study	and	their	course	after	drug	withdrawal	has	not	been	systematically	assessed	.	.
a3970039.s5	Since	it	takes	three	to	12	months	to	achieve	maximal	effects	,	those	patients	who	are	unable	to	continue	the	drug	receive	little	benefit	from	it	.	.
a19767176.s6	In	vehicle	-	treated	rats	,	status_epilepticus	caused	pronounced	neuronal_damage	in	the	piriform	cortex	comprising	both	pyramidal	cells	and	interneurons	.	.
a9390208.s4	Each	course	of	chemotherapy	was	given	every	4	weeks	.	.
a14657095.s2	His	echocardiographic	abnormalities	and	heart_failure	resolved	after	posaconazole	was	substituted	for	AmB.	It	is	important	to	recognize	the	rare	and	potentially	reversible	toxicity	of	AmB.	.
a12684739.s5	Finally	,	we	examined	the	low	dose	of	150	mg	/	kg	(	50	mg	/	kg	per	day	)	using	a	similar	washout	period	.	.
a16858720.s1	PURPOSE	,	To	evaluate	the	frequency	,	severity	and	preventability	of	warfarin	-	induced	cerebral_haemorrhages	due	to	warfarin	and	warfarin	-	drug	interactions	in	patients	living	in	the	county	of	Osterg	_	tland	,	Sweden	.	.
a12198388.s7	Hippocampal	ACh	also	was	measured	during	testing	for	handling	-	induced	convulsions	.	.
a18329269.s1	A	series	of	N	-	pyrimidinyl-2-phenoxyacetamide	adenosine	A(2A	)	antagonists	is	described	.	.
a15649445.s5	Haloperidol	administration	(	one	dose	of	12	mg	/	kg	once	a	week	s.c	.	)	.
a8092427.s13	Challenge	tests	with	AX	were	performed	in	23	subjects	(	43	%	)	to	establish	the	diagnosis	of	immediate	allergic_reaction	to	AX	,	and	in	15	cases	(	28	%	)	both	skin	test	and	RAST	for	AX	were	negative	.	.
a12684739.s0	Sub	-	chronic	low	dose	gamma	-	vinyl_GABA	(	vigabatrin	)	inhibits	cocaine	-	induced	increases	in	nucleus	accumbens	dopamine	.	.
a234669.s4	The	ventricular_fibrillation	threshold	was	measured	by	passing	a	gated	train	of	12	constant	current	pulses	through	the	ventricular	myocardium	during	the	vulnerable	period	of	the	cardiac	cycle	.	.
a8996652.s3	Our	observations	demonstrated	an	association	of	hearing_loss	with	a	higher	incidence	of	perinatal	complications	.	.
a19346865.s10	CONCLUSIONS	,	Reversible	inferior_colliculus_lesions	could	be	considered	as	the	characteristic	for	metronidazole	-	induced	encephalopathy	,	next	to	the	dentate	nucleus	involvement	.	.
a1833784.s2	In	the	present	study	the	role	of	habituation	to	the	experimental	environment	on	the	stimulant	effect	of	nicotine	in	rats	was	examined	.	.
a16574712.s4	Compared	with	MDMA	-	free	polydrug	controls	,	MDMA	polydrug	users	showed	impairments	in	set	shifting	and	memory	updating	,	and	also	in	social	and	emotional	judgement	processes	.	.
a11135224.s12	There	was	one	treatment	-	related	death	.	.
a11007689.s2	Treatments	have	included	discontinuation	or	reduction	of	cyclosporine	dose	with	or	without	concurrent	plasma	exchange	,	plasma	infusion	,	anticoagulation	,	and	intravenous	immunoglobulin	G	infusion	.	.
a3865016.s3	Severe	side	effects	in	terms	of	mental	confusion	and	progressive	hyperbilirubinemia	,	however	,	point	to	an	enhancement	not	only	of	antineoplastic	effects	but	also	of	toxicity	in	normal	tissues	.	.
a18821488.s7	Furthermore	,	transient	hemoglobinuria	was	noted	approximately	60	minutes	postinjection	of	WR242511	(	3.5	or	7.0	mg	/	kg	)	,	and	2	lethalities	occurred	(	one	IV	and	one	PO	)	following	the	7.0	mg	/	kg	dose	.	.
a3780846.s12	Nevertheless	,	there	occurs	some	real	tolerance	to	this	effect	.	.
a16858720.s5	RESULTS	,	Among	593	patients	with	cerebral_haemorrhage	,	59	(	10	%	)	were	assessed	as	related	to	warfarin	treatment	.	.
a9862868.s9	Immunostaining	for	7H6	,	not	ZO-1	,	decreased	and	predominantly	appeared	as	discrete	signals	in	the	submembranous	cytoplasm	of	periportal	hepatocytes	after	BDL	.	.
a9812111.s0	A	randomized	,	placebo	-	controlled	dose	-	comparison	trial	of	haloperidol	for	psychosis	and	disruptive_behaviors	in	Alzheimer's_disease	.	.
a12639165.s9	Immune	mechanisms	may	be	involved	in	the	drug	's	hepatotoxicity	,	as	suggested	by	the	T	-	cell	stimulation	study	reported	here	.	.
a8372922.s2	In	A1	of	macaque	monkeys	,	low	frequencies	are	represented	rostrolaterally	and	high	frequencies	are	represented	caudomedially	.	.
a16904497.s18	Clinical	examination	and	continued	vigilance	for	neurologic_deterioration	after	epidural	steroid	injections	is	important	.	.
a17343925.s13	Further	studies	are	needed	in	order	to	establish	a	potential	negative	effect	of	maternal	smoking	on	the	neonate	's	hearing	acuity	.	.
a17931375.s15	RELEVANCE	TO	CLINICAL	PRACTICE	,	When	administering	subcutaneous	heparin	injections	,	it	is	important	to	extend	the	duration	of	the	injection	.	.
a16167916.s8	RESULTS	,	Three	months	of	raloxifene	treatment	was	associated	with	a	significant	decrease	in	the	plasma	TAFI	antigen	concentrations	(	16	%	change	,	P	<	0.01	)	,	and	a	significant	increase	in	tPA	antigen	concentrations	(	25	%	change	,	P	<	0.05	)	.	.
a6640832.s0	Early	adjuvant	adriamycin	in	superficial	bladder_carcinoma	.	.
a8919272.s5	Organelles	of	these	cells	,	in	particular	the	mitochondria	(	increased	number	and	size	,	distinct	degeneration	of	their	matrix	and	cristae	)	and	Golgi	apparatus	were	altered	.	.
a12198388.s2	Thus	,	the	relationship	between	cholinergic	activity	and	responsiveness	and	alcohol	withdrawal	was	investigated	in	a	genetic	animal	model	of	ethanol	withdrawal	severity	.	.
a14568327.s1	Levodopa	-	induced	dyskinesias	(	LIDs	)	present	a	major	problem	for	the	long	-	term	management	of	Parkinson's_disease	(	PD	)	patients	.	.
a2054792.s1	Thermal	enhancement	of	Adriamycin	-	mediated	antitumor	activity	and	normal	tissue	toxicities	by	whole	body	hyperthermia	were	compared	using	a	F344	rat	model	.	.
a4812392.s2	Haematological	complications	were	not	troublesome	and	results	of	biochemical	liver	function	tests	remained	normal	.	.
a1601297.s1	The	electrocardiograms	(	ECG	)	of	99	cocaine	-	abusing	patients	were	compared	with	the	ECGs	of	50	schizophrenic	controls	.	.
a347884.s8	In	the	double	blind	study	with	haloperidol	,	both	substances	were	found	to	be	highly	effective	in	the	treatment	of	psychotic_syndromes_belonging_predominantly_to_the_schizophrenia_group	.	.
a9931093.s9	FK_506	decreased	eNOS	activity	and	the	levels	of	eNOS	mRNA	in	the	aorta	(	48	%	and	55	%	,	respectively	)	.	.
a17244258.s9	In	contrast	to	controls	,	methoctramine	increased	--	instead	of	decreased	--	the	tonic	responses	at	high	frequencies	.	.
a19058010.s7	These	findings	indicate	the	synergistic	protective	effect	of	green_tea	and	vitamin	E	during	ISO	induced	myocardial_infarction	in	rats	.	.
a12464714.s12	Both	active	treatments	were	well	tolerated	.	.
a7988234.s2	Her	medical	history	included	coronary_artery_disease	with	previous	myocardial_infarctions	,	hypertension	,	and	diabetes_mellitus	.	.
a18023325.s3	One	month	previously	,	she	had	taken	a	single	high	dose	of	disulfiram	(	130	tablets	of	ALCOHOL	STOP	TAB	,	Shin	-	Poong	Pharm	.	.
a2266990.s4	The	study	was	designed	to	have	a	power	of	greater	than	0.90	to	detect	a	slowing	to	25	%	of	the	expected	rate	of	progression	of	weakness	at	P	less	than	0.05	.	.
a1664218.s5	Neutropenia	grade	greater	than	or	equal	to	3	was	seen	in	15	patients	,	infections	with	recovery	in	3	,	and	grand	mal	seizures	in	1	patient	.	.
a2375138.s4	Information	regarding	midazolam	use	is	reviewed	to	provide	recommendation	for	safe	administration	.	.
a20880751.s5	Recent	preclinical	and	clinical	data	from	promising	lines	of	research	focus	on	the	differential	role	of	presynaptic	versus	postsynaptic	mechanisms	,	dopamine	receptor	subtypes	,	ionotropic	and	metabotropic	glutamate	receptors	,	and	non	-	dopaminergic	neurotransmitter	systems	in	the	pathophysiology	of	levodopa	-	induced	dyskinesias	.	.
a14659530.s12	In	contrast	,	serotonin	release	from	platelets	does	not	provoke	migraine	,	it	may	even	counteract	the	headache	and	the	concomitant	CGRP	release	in	this	model	.	.
a20520283.s5	Treatment	-	related	adverse	events	(	AEs	)	occurred	in	44	%	and	52	%	,	57	%	,	and	41	%	of	the	asenapine	at	5	and	10	mg	BID	,	haloperidol	,	and	placebo	groups	,	respectively	.	.
a3076126.s4	Both	agents	show	substantial	clinical	efficacy	,	with	reductions	in	total	cholesterol	of	over	30	%	and	in	LDL	-	cholesterol	of	40	%	in	clinical	studies	.	.
a9199746.s1	BACKGROUND	,	Although	intravitreal	aminoglycosides	have	substantially	improved	visual	prognosis	in	endophthalmitis	,	macular	infarction	may	impair	full	visual	recovery	.	.
a18726058.s12	One	patient	showed	no	recovery	of	later	waves	and	a	delayed	profound	sensorineural_hearing_loss	.	.
a11745184.s9	After	completion	of	the	amifostine	infusion	,	cisplatin	120	mg	/	m2	was	administered	over	30	minutes	.	.
a12639165.s8	The	mechanisms	of	this	ticlopidine	-	induced	cholestasis	are	unclear	.	.
a8643971.s8	The	dose	levels	incorporate	escalating	paclitaxel	doses	,	and	intrapatient	escalations	within	a	given	dose	level	are	permitted	if	toxicity	permits	.	.
a8955532.s4	Phenylephrine	infusion	increased	arterial	pressure	,	arteriolar	diameter	and	clearance	of	fluorescent	dextran	by	a	similar	magnitude	in	both	groups	.	.
a19657887.s5	In	less	than	1	hour	after	the	ingestion	of	alcohol	,	he	developed	malaise	with	flushing_of_the_face	,	tachycardia	,	and	dyspnea	.	.
a10579464.s5	NRA0160	and	clozapine	antagonized	MAP	-	induced	stereotyped	behavior	in	mice	,	although	their	effects	did	not	exceed	50	%	inhibition	,	even	at	the	highest	dose	given	.	.
a2696505.s5	Arterial	PO2	decreased	in	both	groups	.	.
a15859940.s13	In	the	current	study	,	the	frequency	of	thrombotic_microangiopathy	was	similar	to	the	percentage	reported	in	the	literature	(	20	%	)	.	.
a16337777.s7	Although	evidences	of	mitochondrial_abnormalities	were	found	in	previously	published	studies	,	our	results	do	not	suggest	that	the	FRs	,	generated	during	the	acute	phase	,	determined	important	abnormalities	in	mtDNA	,	in	expression	of	CCO	-	I	,	and	in	CCO	activity	.	.
a11426838.s9	To	further	validate	the	hypothesis	that	the	anti	-	cocaine	effects	of	the	novel	ligands	involved	antagonism	of	sigma	receptors	,	an	antisense	oligodeoxynucleotide	against	sigma1	receptors	was	also	shown	to	significantly	attenuate	the	convulsive	and	locomotor	stimulatory	effects	of	cocaine	.	.
a19269743.s7	The	strong	burning	pain	decayed	exponentially	within	a	few	minutes	.	.
a12589964.s19	All	markers	remained	stable	in	controls	.	.
a17615423.s10	CONCLUSIONS	,	Pharmacokinetic	differences	in	statins	are	an	important	consideration	for	assessing	the	risk	of	potential	drug	interactions	.	.
a2054792.s3	Acute	normal	tissue	toxicities	(	i.e.	,	leukopenia	and	thrombocytopenia	)	and	late	normal	tissue	toxicities	(	i.e.	,	myocardial_and_kidney_injury	)	were	evaluated	by	functional	/	physiological	assays	and	by	morphological	techniques	.	.
a7234705.s6	In	two	patients	,	the	arrhythmia	degenerated	into	irreversible	ventricular_fibrillation	and	both	patients	died	.	.
a18791946.s0	Severe	thrombocytopenia	and	haemolytic_anaemia	associated	with	ciprofloxacin	,	a	case	report	with	fatal	outcome	.	.
a17111419.s3	Past	medical	history	was	remarkable	for	hypertension	,	hyperlipidemia	,	and	depression	.	.
a1720453.s8	Two	subsets	of	patients	were	identified	from	this	latter	group	,	the	first	included	four	patients	(	5	%	of	the	total	population	)	who	developed	major	toxicity	resulting	in	Fanconi's_syndrome	(	TDFS	)	,	and	the	second	group	included	five	patients	with	elevated	beta	2	microglobulinuria	and	low	phosphate	reabsorption	.	.
a2484011.s6	Subsequent	amantadine	treatments	produced	enhancement	of	motility	from	corresponding	control	in	all	mouse	strains	with	the	BALB	/	C	mice	being	the	least	sensitive	.	.
a20880751.s2	However	,	the	long	-	term	use	of	this	dopamine	precursor	is	complicated	by	highly	disabling	fluctuations	and	dyskinesias	.	.
a16867021.s9	per	se	did	not	cause_catalepsy	.	.
a12716030.s6	Data	suggest	that	this	sensitive	hemoglobin	assay	is	useful	for	ICH	detection	,	and	that	a	model	with	a	small	ICH	induced	with	a	low	-	dose	collagenase	should	be	used	for	evaluation	of	drugs	that	may	affect	ICH	.	.
a11135224.s6	RESULTS	,	All	the	patients	were	examined	for	toxicity	,	34	were	examinable	for	response	.	.
a15338796.s0	Tremor	side	effects	of	salbutamol	,	quantified	by	a	laser	pointer	technique	.	.
a20619828.s3	METHODS	,	Neonatal	rats	were	treated	with	the	tricyclic	antidepressant	clomipramine	or	vehicle	between	days	9	and	16	twice	daily	and	behaviorally	tested	in	adulthood	.	.
a11431197.s6	Allograft	function	improved	rapidly	and	returned	to	baseline	after	stopping	the	drug	.	.
a2234245.s8	The	data	indicate	that	audiovisual_toxicity	is	not	an	infrequent	complication	in	hemodialyzed	patients	receiving	desferrioxamine	.	.
a17147461.s5	However	,	clinical	reports	suggest	that	,	under	some	circumstances	,	sirolimus	is	associated	with	proteinuria	and	acute_renal_dysfunction	.	.
a1616457.s3	In	Group	1	the	rats	were	trained	under	the	influence	of	pentobarbital	to	run	to	the	same	shelf	as	in	the	normal	state	.	.
a17147461.s8	It	has	also	been	suggested	that	sirolimus	directly	causes	increased	glomerular	permeability	/	injury	,	but	evidence	for	this	mechanism	is	currently	inconclusive	.	.
a16904497.s2	Cauda_equina_syndrome	is	a	rare	complication	of	epidural	anesthesia	.	.
a19957053.s4	Heart	rate	(	HR	)	,	MAP	,	stroke	volume	(	SV	)	,	cardiac	output	(	CO	)	,	and	frontal	lobe	oxygenation	(	S(c)O(2	)	)	were	registered	.	.
a17931375.s3	DESIGN	,	This	study	was	designed	as	within	-	subject	,	quasi	-	experimental	research	.	.
a3560096.s3	We	describe	4	patients	in	whom	hyperkalemia	ranging	from	6.1	to	6.9	mEq	/	l	developed	within	3	to	8	days	of	sulindac	administration	.	.
a354896.s1	Intravenous	administration	of	a	single	50-mg	bolus	of	lidocaine	in	a	67-year	-	old	man	resulted	in	profound	depression	of	the	activity	of	the	sinoatrial	and	atrioventricular	nodal	pacemakers	.	.
a9199746.s5	CONCLUSIONS	,	Currently	accepted	intravitreal	antibiotic	regimens	may	cause	retinal_toxicity	and	macular	ischaemia	.	.
a2234245.s6	Desferrioxamine	withdrawal	resulted	in	a	complete	recovery	of	visual	function	in	1	patient	and	partial	recovery	in	3	,	and	a	complete	reversal	of	hearing_loss	in	3	patients	and	partial	recovery	in	3	.	.
a15899738.s7	However	,	when	the	patient	was	questioned	about	use	of	herbal	products	and	supplements	,	the	use	of	creatine	monohydrate	was	revealed	.	.
a8092427.s5	When	both	skin	test	and	RAST	for	BPO	were	negative	,	single	-	blind	,	placebo	-	controlled	challenge	tests	were	done	to	ensure	tolerance	of	PG	or	sensitivity	to	AX	.	.
a16755009.s10	and	diazepam	(	1	mg	/	kg	,	i.p	.	)	.	.
a4812392.s0	Treatment	of	psoriasis	with	azathioprine	.	.
a12617329.s3	Nephrotoxicity	was	assessed	by	measuring	the	concentrations	of	creatinine	and	urea	in	the	plasma	and	reduced	glutathione	(	GSH	)	in	the	kidney	cortex	,	and	by	light	microscopic	examination	of	kidney	sections	.	.
a18703024.s2	The	goal	of	these	studies	was	to	use	an	animal	model	to	examine	the	effects	of	prenatal	protein	deprivation	on	behaviors	and	receptor	binding	with	relevance	to	schizophrenia	.	.
a15009014.s1	Cluster_headache	is	characterized	by	typical	autonomic	dysfunctions	including	facial	and	intracranial_vascular_disturbances	.	.
a19657887.s3	The	purpose	of	this	report	is	to	describe	two	cases	of	a	disulfiram	-	like	syndrome	following	occupational	exposure	to	hydrogen_cyanamide	.	.
a17437408.s6	METHODS	,	The	expression	of	MRP2	and	Pgp	in	brain	and	liver	sections	of	TR(-	)	rats	and	normal	Wistar	rats	was	determined	with	immunohistochemistry	,	by	using	a	novel	,	highly	selective	monoclonal	MRP2	antibody	and	the	monoclonal	Pgp	antibody	C219	,	respectively	.	.
a1592014.s7	Whereas	cocaine	-	induced	seizures	were	best	characterized	as	brief	,	generalized	,	and	tonic	and	resulted	in	death	,	those	induced	by	BE	were	prolonged	,	often	multiple	and	mixed	in	type	,	and	rarely	resulted	in	death	.	.
a12536034.s3	The	gamma	-	aminobutyric_acid	-	transmitted	thalamocortical	circuitry	accounts	for	a	major	part	of	the	underlying	neurophysiology	of	the	absence_epilepsy	.	.
a7890216.s5	Gall	bladder	bile	was	obtained	by	ultrasound	guided	,	fine	needle	puncture	from	six	patients	.	.
a1967484.s1	Sulpiride	is	a	selective	D2-receptor	antagonist	with	antipsychotic	and	antidepressant	properties	.	.
a12757899.s2	We	compared	the	effects	of	17beta	-	estradiol	in	adult	male	and	ovariectomized	female	rats	subjected	to	lithium	-	pilocarpine	-	induced	SE	.	.
a7890216.s6	All	six	patients	had	supersaturated	bile	(	mean	(	SEM	)	cholesterol	saturation	index	of	1.19	(	0.08	)	(	range	1.01	-	1.53	)	)	and	all	had	abnormally	rapid	cholesterol	microcrystal	nucleation	times	(	<	4	days	(	range	1	-	4	)	)	,	whilst	in	four	,	the	bile	contained	cholesterol	microcrystals	immediately	after	sampling	.	.
a3827439.s1	A	patient	with	cryptogenic	cirrhosis	and	disseminated	sporotrichosis	developed	acute_renal_failure	immediately	following	the	administration	of	amphotericin	B	on	four	separate	occasions	.	.
a10457883.s2	Accumulation	of	atracurium	in	the	intravenous	line	led	to	recurarization	after	flushing	the	line	in	the	recovery	room	.	.
a12589964.s8	Histology	was	performed	in	DOX	-	rats	at	6	and	9	weeks	after	the	last	DOX	dose	and	in	all	controls	.	.
a18083142.s0	Norepinephrine	signaling	through	beta	-	adrenergic	receptors	is	critical	for	expression	of	cocaine	-	induced	anxiety	.	.
a7890216.s1	Octreotide	,	an	effective	treatment	for	acromegaly	,	induces	gall_bladder_stones	in	13	-	60	%	of	patients	.	.
a9660111.s6	does	not	antagonize	the	reserpine	hypothermia	in	mice	and	does	not	potentiate	the	5-hydroxytryptophan	head	twitches	in	rats	.	.
