a18544179.s8	Combining	the	two	fentanyl	groups	revealed	further	significant	benefits	from	the	avoidance	of	opioids	,	reducing	postoperative_nausea_and_vomiting	and	nausea	prior	to	discharge	from	35	%	and	33	%	to	22	%	and	19	%	(	P	=	0.049	and	P	=	0.035	)	,	respectively	,	while	nausea	in	the	first	24	h	was	decreased	from	42	%	to	27	%	(	P	=	0.034	)	.	.
a1009330.s4	Picloxydine	irrigations	appeared	to	have	a	lower	incidence	of	erosive	cystitis	but	further	studies	would	have	to	be	performed	before	it	could	be	recommended	for	use	in	urological	procedures	.	.
a17437408.s12	CONCLUSIONS	,	The	data	on	TR(-	)	rats	indicate	that	Pgp	plays	an	important	role	in	the	compensation	of	MRP2	deficiency	in	the	BBB	.	.
a1378968.s7	HP	failed	to	accentuante	progression	of	renal_failure	and	in	fact	tended	to	increase	GFR	and	decrease	plasma	creatinine	levels	in	lithium	pretreated	rats	.	.
a19729346.s1	This	study	measured	the	objective	and	subjective	neurocognitive	effects	of	a	single	10-mg	dose	of	immediate	-	release	oxycodone	in	healthy	,	older	(	>	65	years	)	,	and	middle	-	aged	(	35	to	55	years	)	adults	who	were	not	suffering	from	chronic	or	significant	daily	pain	.	.
a347884.s2	The	open	study	lasted	for	four	weeks	,	the	drug	was	administrated	in	the	form	of	1	mg	tablets	.	.
a18217897.s8	Of	concern	was	the	occurrence	of	four	thromboembolic	events	.	.
a2234245.s4	Visual_toxicity	was	of	retinal	origin	and	was	characterized	by	a	tritan	-	type	dyschromatopsy	,	sometimes	associated	with	a_loss_of_visual_acuity	and	pigmentary_retinal_deposits	.	.
a17241784.s8	The	mechanism	of	this	myopathy	is	uncertain	but	may	involve	the	induction	by	statins	of	an	endoplasmic	reticulum	stress	response	with	associated	up	-	regulation	of	MHC	-	I	expression	and	antigen	presentation	by	muscle	fibres	.	.
a8437969.s1	The	administration	of	intermittent	intravenous	infusions	of	cimetidine	is	infrequently	associated	with	the	development	of	bradyarrhythmias	.	.
a15899738.s2	Therefore	,	when	the	arrhythmia	is	present	in	this	population	,	reversible	causes	must	be	identified	and	resolved	.	.
a8643971.s19	Results	thus	far	suggest	no	dose	-	response	effect	for	paclitaxel	doses	above	200	mg	/	m2	.	.

a14568327.s6	All	animals	were	similarly	symptomatic	at	the	start	of	levodopa	treatment	and	had	similar	therapeutic	responses	to	the	drug	.	.
a8386779.s1	In	an	attempt	to	determine	whether	penile_pain	associated	with	intracorporeal	injections	could	be	due	to	the	acidity	of	the	medication	,	we	performed	a	randomized	study	comparing	the	incidence	of	penile_pain	following	intracorporeal	injections	with	or	without	the	addition	of	sodium_bicarbonate	to	the	intracorporeal	medications	.	.

a17608141.s1	Immunological	activation	has	been	proposed	to	play	a	role	in	methamphetamine	-	induced	dopaminergic_terminal_damage	.	.
a11773892.s12	Overall	survival	from	the	time	of	OLTX	was	not	significantly	different	among	groups	,	but	by	year	13	,	the	survival	of	the	patients	who	had	ESRD	was	only	28.2	%	compared	with	54.6	%	in	the	control	group	.	.
a10901305.s12	Blood	pressure	and	heart	rate	remained	stable	.	.
a11263551.s9	Incorrect	diagnosis	of	the	syndrome	will	lead	to	a	significant	reduction	of	life	quality	in	patients	suffering	from	CIPS	.	.

a15863244.s15	Prenatal	exposure	to	selective	COX-2	inhibitors	does	not	increase	the	risk	of	ventricular_septal_and_midline_defects	in	rat	when	compared	to	non	-	selective	drugs	and	historic	control	.	.
a7881871.s9	This	study	supports	the	role	of	lipid	peroxidation	in	mediating	the	proteinuric_injury	in	PAN	nephropathy	.	.
a2559236.s9	Enalapril	treatment	blunted	but	did	not	prevent	reduction	in	GFR	in	group	4	(	0.86	+	/-	0.15	ml	/	min	at	4	months	,	0.69	+	/-	0.13	ml	/	min	at	6	months	,	both	P	less	than	0.05	vs.	group	3	)	.	.
a12716030.s1	The	aggravated	risk	on	intracerebral_hemorrhage	(	ICH	)	with	drugs	used	for	stroke	patients	should	be	estimated	carefully	.	.

a15145918.s5	In	sham	-	operated	rats	,	rilmenidine	or	alpha	-	methyldopa	elicited	similar	hypotension	that	lasted	at	least	5	h	and	was	associated	with	reductions	in	standard	deviation	of	mean	arterial	pressure	.	.
a2484011.s13	The	biochemical	results	of	brain	biogenic	amines	of	BALB	/	C	mouse	strain	suggest	a	probable	decrease	of	catecholamine	turnover	rate	and/or	metabolism	by	monoamine	oxidase	and	a	resulting	increase	in	O	-	methylation	of	norepinephrine	which	may	account	for	a	behavioral_depression	caused	by	amantadine	in	the	BALB	/	C	mice	.	.

a9088814.s6	AKBR	and	biological	hepatic	function	tests	showed	no	change	throughout	the	time	course	in	groups	A	and	B.	In	group	C	,	AKBR	showed	a	significant	decrease	at	120	min	(	-40	%	)	and	at	180	min	(	-49	%	)	after	the	start	of	hypotension	and	at	60	min	(	-32	%	)	after	recovery	of	normotension	,	and	SGOT	,	SGPT	,	LDH	and	total	bilirubin	showed	significant	increases	after	operation	.	.
a1749407.s5	Although	certain	clinical	and	experimental	findings	support	the	hypothesis	that	spasm	involves	the	epicardial	,	medium	-	size	vessels	,	other	data	suggest	intramural	vasoconstriction	.	.

a137340.s9	The	study	suggests	that	the	activity	-	increasing	effects	of	morphine	are	mediated	by	the	release	of	catecholamines	from	adrenergic	neurons	in	the	brain	.	.
a18560792.s5	Thirty	PD	patients	participated	in	the	study	.	.
a12584269.s11	The	semi	-	quantitative	scoring	was	significantly	worst	in	the	group	treated	with	CsA	plus	SRL	(	P<0.001	compared	with	controls	)	and	the	analysis	of	the	total	grade	of	fibrosis	also	showed	the	highest	proportion	in	the	same	group	and	was	significantly	different	from	controls	(	P<0.02	)	.	.

a12464714.s6	Forty	-	nine	percent	of	patients	were	pain	free	2	h	after	rizatriptan	,	compared	with	24.3	%	treated	with	ergotamine	/	caffeine	(	p	<	or	=	0.001	)	,	rizatriptan	being	superior	within	1	h	of	treatment	.	.
a19037603.s13	Prophylactic	administration	of	lamivudine	in	patients	who	required	immunosuppressive	therapy	seems	to	be	safe	,	well	tolerated	and	effective	in	preventing	HBV	reactivation	.	.
a8387218.s9	The	most	common	side	-	effect	was	diarrhoea	,	which	resulted	in	cessation	of	therapy	in	19	individuals	.	.
a10669626.s3	Treatment	for	2	weeks	with	Warfarin	caused	massive	focal	calcification_of_the_artery	media	in	20-day	-	old	rats	and	less	extensive	focal	calcification	in	42-day	-	old	rats	.	.
a12589964.s5	Ten	rats	received	saline	as	a	control	group	.	.
a809711.s2	Our	study	was	designed	to	determine	the	effects	of	combined	nitroglycerin	and	phenylephrine	therapy	.	.
a7582165.s10	The	basic	mechanisms	of	those	reactions	are	not	yet	fully	understood	.	.
a7504976.s9	CONCLUSION	,	Toxic_hepatitis	is	a	potential	adverse	effect	of	antithyroid	drugs	which	warrants	,	as	for	haematological	disturbances	,	a	pre	-	therapeutic	determination	and	a	careful	follow	-	up	of	relevant	biological	markers	.	.
a347884.s5	These	results	were	confirmed	by	statistical	analysis	.	.
a18186898.s0	Renal_Fanconi_syndrome	and	myopathy	after	liver	transplantation	,	drug	-	related	mitochondrial_cytopathy	?	.
a15572383.s7	n	=	9	]	.	.
a3496378.s4	Finally	,	pruritus	disappeared	within	19	months	,	and	liver	tests	returned	to	normal	27	months	after	the	onset	of	hepatitis	.	.
a9522152.s3	Sensation	in	this	area	returned	to	normal	over	the	following	2	weeks	.	.
a17437408.s5	This	prompted	us	to	study	the	brain	expression	of	P	-	glycoprotein	(	Pgp	)	,	a	major	drug	efflux	transporter	in	many	tissues	,	including	the	BBB	,	in	TR(-	)	rats	compared	with	nonmutant	(	wild	-	type	)	Wistar	rats	.	.
a2476560.s4	Preparations	containing	lindane	continue	to	be	sold	over	the	counter	and	may	represent	a	hazard	to	poorly	informed	patients	.	.
a2385256.s5	After	her	strength	returned	,	repetitive	stimulation	was	normal	,	but	single	fiber	EMG	revealed	increased	jitter	and	blocking	.	.
a3780846.s8	was	used	in	order	to	block	the	dopaminergic	activation	and	to	estimate	the	real	degree	of	the	tolerance	to	the	rigidity	without	any	dopaminergic	interference	.	.
a603022.s1	Galanthamine_hydrobromide	,	an	anticholinesterase	drug	capable	of	penetrating	the	blood	-	brain	barrier	,	was	used	in	a	patient	demonstrating	central	effects	of	scopolamine	(	hyoscine	)	overdosage	.	.
a1378968.s11	In	this	model	of	chronic_renal_failure	the	decline	in	GFR	is	not	accompanied	by	a	corresponding	fall	in	effective	renal	plasma	flow	,	which	may	be	the	functional	expression	of	the	formation	of	nonfiltrating	atubular	glomeruli	.	.
a88336.s6	The	similarities	between	the	effects	of	structural	lesions	and	pharmacological	depression	of	the	brain	stem	reticular	formation	are	discussed	.	.
a20528871.s2	The	most	common	side	effects	attributable	to	the	AraG	included	Grade	2	and	3	sensory	and	motor	neuropathy	and	musculoskeletal_pain	.	.
a11807648.s12	INTERPRETATION	,	Tranexamic_acid	retains	its	convulsive	action	within	FS	.	.
a2334618.s3	Monitoring	consisted	of	airflow	detection	by	a	carbon_dioxide	analyser	,	chest	wall	movement	detected	by	pneumatic	capsules	,	and	continuous	electrocardiograph	recorded	with	a	Holter	ambulatory	monitor	.	.
a9351491.s1	Risperidone	is	an	antipsychotic	drug	with	high	affinity	at	dopamine	D2	and	serotonin_5-HT2	receptors	.	.
a10669626.s4	In	contrast	,	no	artery_calcification	could	be	detected	in	10-month	-	old	adult	rats	even	after	4	weeks	of	Warfarin	treatment	.	.
a11745184.s2	Older	reports	suggest	an	objective	response	rate	of	8	%	when	60	-	120	mg	/	m2	of	cisplatin	is	administered	every	3	-	4	weeks	.	.
a16938416.s5	RESULTS	,	Intramuscular	hormone	therapy	use	for	1	year	or	longer	was	reported	by	25	women	.	.
a19759529.s2	However	,	the	observation	that	antagonists	of	the	glutamate	N	-	methyl	-	D	-	aspartate	(	NMDA	)	receptor	produce	schizophrenic	-	like	symptoms	in	humans	has	led	to	the	idea	of	a	dysfunctioning	of	the	glutamatergic	system	via	its	NMDA	receptor	.	.
a20619828.s4	RESULTS	,	Clomipramine	exposure	in	immature	rats	produced	significant	behavioral	and	biochemical	changes	that	include	enhanced	anxiety	(	elevated	plus	maze	and	marble	burying	)	,	behavioral_inflexibility	(	perseveration	in	the	spontaneous	alternation	task	and	impaired	reversal	learning	)	,	working	memory_impairment	(	e.g.	,	win	-	shift	paradigm	)	,	hoarding	,	and	corticostriatal_dysfunction	.	.
a18023325.s8	A	nerve	conduction	study	was	consistent	with	severe	sensorimotor	axonal	polyneuropathy	.	.
a3015567.s3	Application	of	a	delayed	feedback	signal	,	in	the	form	of	a	2-h	systemic	corticosterone	infusion	in	urethane	-	anesthetized	rats	with	pharmacological	blockade	of	glucocorticoid	synthesis	,	is	without	effect	on	the	resting	secretion	of	arginine_vasopressin	and	oxytocin	at	any	corticosterone	feedback	dose	tested	.	.
a16330293.s14	The	most	common	adverse	events	were	nausea	(	17.2	%	and	16.1	%	,	95	%	CI	,	-3.7	to	6.0	)	,	hiccups	(	10.7	%	and	6.6	%	,	95	%	CI	,	0.5	to	7.8	)	,	and	headache	(	8.7	%	and	9.9	%	,	95	%	Cl	,	-5.0	to	2.6	)	.	.
a18619688.s2	The	aim	of	this	study	was	to	investigate	whether	autophagy	was	involved	in	the	progression	of	heart_failure	induced	by	adriamycin	,	so	that	we	can	develop	a	novel	treatment	strategy	for	heart_failure	.	.
a17615423.s9	Amiodarone	and	atazanavir	are	recognized	CYP3A4	inhibitors	.	.
a15649445.s2	In	the	present	study	,	the	authors	induced	orofacial_dyskinesia	by	acute	reserpine	and	subchronic	haloperidol	administration	to	rats	.	.
a15572383.s14	CONCLUSION	,	Individual	differences	in	renal	ACE	activity	predict	the	severity	of	adriamycin	-	induced	renal_damage	in	this	outbred	rat	strain	.	.
a17931375.s6	Injections	areas	were	assessed	for	the	presence	of	bruising	at	48	and	72	hours	after	each	injection	.	.
a19820426.s2	One	of	the	twins	developed	complete	heart_block	and	dilated_cardiomyopathy	related	to	lopinavir	/	ritonavir	therapy	,	a	boosted	protease	-	inhibitor	agent	,	while	the	other	twin	developed	mild	bradycardia	.	.

a10901305.s0	Ketamine	sedation	for	the	reduction	of	children	's	fractures	in	the	emergency	department	.	.
a18308784.s9	We	conclude	that	Rg1	may	significantly	improve	the	spatial	learning	capacity	impaired	by	chonic	morphine	administration	and	restore	the	morphine	-	inhibited	LTP	.	.
a7234705.s5	In	four	patients	,	the	arrhythmia	was	rapidly	diagnosed	and	treated	with	disappearance	of	further	episodes	of	the	arrhythmia	.	.
a10526274.s15	Six	patients	(	12	%	)	had	World	Health	Organization	Grade	3	-	4	neutropenia	,	2	patients	(	4	%	)	had	Grade	3	-	4	thrombocytopenia	,	and	2	patients	(	4	%	)	had	Grade	3	neurotoxicity	.	.
a3425586.s5	The	pentose_phosphate	shunt	activity	of	the	non	-	dapsone	-	exposed	AE	RBCs	was	decreased	compared	to	normal	RBCs	.	.
a137340.s0	Effect	of	humoral	modulators	of	morphine	-	induced	increase_in_locomotor_activity	of	mice	.	.
a2578334.s7	Perhaps	two	events	might	be	necessary	for	initiation	,	the	first	caused	by	the	carcinogen	and	a	second	involving	hypomethylation	of	DNA	.	.
a2224762.s13	Activity	was	noted	in	mesothelioma	,	leiomyosarcoma	,	and	basal_cell_carcinoma	.	.
a16330293.s5	Patients	were	randomized	in	a	1,1	ratio	to	receive	the	4-mg	nicotine	lozenge	or	4-mg	nicotine	gum	.	.
a20588063.s14	The	novel	proteins	dendrin	and	plekhh2	were	both	reduced	,	suggesting	roles	in	PAN	,	whereas	a	-	actinin	was	unchanged	.	.
a16337777.s1	Mitochondrial_abnormalities	have	been	associated	with	several	aspects	of	epileptogenesis	,	such	as	energy	generation	,	control	of	cell	death	,	neurotransmitter	synthesis	,	and	free	radical	(	FR	)	production	.	.
a8682684.s1	Through	30	years	of	widespread	use	,	acetaminophen	has	been	shown	to	be	a	remarkably	safe	medication	in	therapeutic	dosages	.	.
a2224762.s2	Twenty	-	six	had	minimal	prior	therapy	(	good	risk	)	,	23	had	extensive	prior	therapy	(	poor	risk	)	,	and	six	had	renal_and	/	or_hepatic_dysfunction	.	.
a2445283.s6	The	possible	beneficial	effect	of	ribavirin	during	the	initial	days	of	AHF	is	discussed	.	.
a11807648.s2	In	order	to	increase	clot	stability	,	FS	typically	contain	aprotinin	,	a	natural	fibrinolysis	inhibitor	.	.
a15275829.s4	We	examined	the	role	of	the	beta4	subunits	in	nicotine	-	induced	seizures	and	hypolocomotion	in	beta4	homozygous	null	(	beta4	-/-	)	and	alpha3	heterozygous	(	+	/-	)	mice	.	.
a7582165.s2	A	few	minutes	after	administration	of	the	drugs	,	they	presented	urticaria	(	patients	1	and	2	)	and	conjunctivitis	(	patient	1	)	.	.
a20520283.s2	In	a	double	-	blind	6-week	trial	,	458	patients	with	acute	schizophrenia	were	randomly	assigned	to	fixed	-	dose	treatment	with	asenapine	at	5	mg	twice	daily	(	BID	)	,	asenapine	at	10	mg	BID	,	placebo	,	or	haloperidol	at	4	mg	BID	(	to	verify	assay	sensitivity	)	.	.
a18703024.s3	We	report	that	prenatally	protein	deprived	(	PD	)	female	rats	showed	an	increased	stereotypic	response	to	apomorphine	and	an	increased	locomotor	response	to	amphetamine	in	adulthood	.	.
a15130900.s3	Through	linkage	with	the	Swedish	Cancer	Register	,	all	subjects	in	this	cohort	diagnosed	with	bladder_cancer	were	identified	.	.
a15233872.s0	Cardioprotective	effect	of	tincture_of_Crataegus	on	isoproterenol	-	induced	myocardial_infarction	in	rats	.	.
