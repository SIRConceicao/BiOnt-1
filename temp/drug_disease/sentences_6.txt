a16740173.s3	METHODS	,	The	son	of	an	84-year	-	old	male	discovered	a	newspaper	report	stating	clinical	success	with	plant	extracts	in	Alzheimer's_disease	.	.
a3856631.s2	The	methotrexate	was	administered	as	a	loading	dose	of	6,000	mg	/	m2	for	a	period	of	one	hour	followed	by	an	infusion	of	1,200	mg	/	m2/h	for	23	hours	.	.
a8643971.s3	We	initiated	a	phase	I	/	II	trial	to	determine	the	response	and	toxicity	of	escalating	paclitaxel	doses	combined	with	fixed	-	dose	cisplatin	with	granulocyte	colony	-	stimulating	factor	support	in	patients	with	untreated	locally	advanced	inoperable	head_and_neck_carcinoma	.	.

a15338796.s18	DISCUSSION	,	Quantifying	tremor	by	using	an	inexpensive	laser	pointer	is	,	with	the	exception	of	children	(	<	12	years	)	a	sensitive	and	reproducible	method	.	.
a12921865.s8	These	findings	demonstrate	that	some	neuroactive	steroids	attenuate	convulsant	and	sensitizing	properties	of	cocaine	and	add	to	a	growing	literature	on	their	potential	use	in	the	modulation	of	effects	of	drugs	of	abuse	.	.
a18951540.s2	Ten	patients	with	PD	and	prominent	dyskinesias	had	rTMS	(	1,800	pulses	,	1	Hz	rate	)	delivered	over	the	motor	cortex	for	4	consecutive	days	twice	,	once	real	stimuli	and	once	sham	stimulation	were	used	,	evaluations	were	done	at	the	baseline	and	1	day	after	the	end	of	each	of	the	treatment	series	.	.
a16167916.s1	BACKGROUND	,	Markers	of	fibrinolysis	,	thrombin	-	activatable	fibrinolysis	inhibitor	(	TAFI	)	,	tissue	-	type	plasminogen	activator	(	tPA	)	,	and	plasminogen	activator	inhibitor-1	(	PAI-1	)	levels	were	studied	for	the	evaluation	of	short	-	term	effects	of	raloxifene	administration	in	postmenopausal	women	.	.
a17562951.s1	BACKGROUND	,	No	direct	comparisons	exist	of	the	renal	tolerability	of	the	low	-	osmolality	contrast_medium	iopamidol	with	that	of	the	iso	-	osmolality	contrast_medium	iodixanol	in	high	-	risk	patients	.	.
a12464714.s13	The	most	common	adverse	events	(	incidence	>	or	=	5	%	in	one	group	)	after	rizatriptan	and	ergotamine	/	caffeine	,	respectively	,	were	dizziness	(	6.7	and	5.3	%	)	,	nausea	(	4.2	and	8.5	%	)	and	somnolence	(	5.5	and	2.3	%	)	.	.
a18821488.s5	Health	status	and	MHb	levels	were	monitored	following	exposure	.	.
a1833784.s5	Nicotine	(	1.0	mg	/	kg	)	caused	a	significant	increase_in_locomotor_activity	in	rats	that	were	habituated	to	the	test	environment	,	but	had	only	a	weak	and	delayed	stimulant	action	in	rats	that	were	unfamiliar	with	the	test	environment	.	.
a10091617.s2	Recently	,	we	found	that	therapy	with	selegiline	and	L	-	dopa	was	associated	with	selective	systolic_orthostatic_hypotension	which	was	abolished	by	withdrawal	of	selegiline	.	.
a15602202.s2	The	second	episode	was	more	severe	than	the	first	,	and	although	both	were	treated	with	intensive	corticosteroid	therapy	,	renal	function	remained	impaired	.	.
a17244258.s12	While	postjunctional	beta	-	adrenoceptor	-	mediated	relaxations	are	reduced	,	effects	by	prejunctional	inhibitory	muscarinic	receptors	may	be	increased	.	.
a19657887.s8	Five	hours	after	exposure	,	he	developed	disulfiram	-	like	syndrome	with	flushing	,	tachycardia	,	and	arterial_hypotension	after	consuming	three	glasses	of	wine	.	.
a1616457.s6	Differences	in	the	parameters	of	training	under	the	influence	of	pentobarbital	between	Groups	1	and	2	were	revealed	.	.
a9245658.s2	Animal	studies	and	mechanistic	studies	indicate	that	nicotine	could	play	a	role	in	accelerating	atherosclerosis	,	but	evidence	among	humans	is	too	inadequate	to	be	definitive	about	such	an	effect	.	.
a8590259.s5	No	significant	changes	in	diastolic	blood	pressure	,	pulse	rate	and	basal	tear	secretion	were	noted	.	.
a19767176.s5	Administration	of	50	mg	/	kg	PDTC	(	low	-	dose	)	did	not	exert	major	effects	on	the	development	of	a	status_epilepticus	or	the	mortality	rate	.	.
a1378968.s5	Consequently	,	lithium	pretreatment	caused	a	fall	in	filtration	fraction	and	an	increase	in	fractional	Li	excretion	.	.
a12684739.s3	OBJECTIVES	,	Given	its	preclinical	success	for	treating	substance_abuse	and	the	increased	risk	of	visual_field_defects	(	VFD	)	associated	with	cumulative	lifetime	exposure	,	we	explored	the	effects	of	sub	-	chronic	low	dose	GVG	on	cocaine	-	induced	increases	in	nucleus	accumbens	(	NAcc	)	dopamine	(	DA	)	.	.
a8829025.s1	The	effect	of	nifedipine	on	renal	function	in	liver	transplant	recipients	who	were	receiving	tacrolimus	was	evaluated	between	January	1992	and	January	1996	.	.

a2870085.s12	Use	of	flestolol	in	the	critical	care	setting	is	currently	undergoing	investigation	.	.
a19759529.s6	Results	showed	that	SSR103800	(	10	-	30	mg	/	kg	p.o	.	)	.
a19211690.s9	HS	diet	for	4	wk	caused	a	progressive	increase	in	BP	,	protein	and	albumin	excretion	,	and	glomerular_sclerosis	in	male	DS	rats	,	which	were	attenuated	by	castration	.	.
a8864707.s11	Quantitative	morphometric	studies	of	the	cerebellum	provide	valuable	insights	into	the	pathogenesis	of	cerebellar_disorders	.	.
a8387218.s7	Most	patients	showed	improvement	in	individual	parameters	and	global	score	of	quality	of	life	.	.
a1549199.s5	Nonpharmacologic	concerns	can	help	the	Parkinson's_disease	patient	achieve	and	maintain	optimal	functioning	,	including	daily	exercise	,	physical	therapy	,	and	involvement	with	support	groups	.	.
a16403073.s2	We	report	a	woman	with	coronary_artery_disease	who	developed	a	markedly	prolonged_QT_interval	and	torsades_de_pointes	(	TdP	)	after	taking	ketoconazole	for	treatment	of	fungal_infection	.	.
a11706060.s3	At	termination	of	the	experiments	,	mice	underwent	echocardiography	,	quantitation	of	abundance	of	molecular	markers	of	CM	(	ventricular	mRNA	encoding	atrial	natriuretic	factor	[	ANF	]	and	sarcoplasmic	calcium	ATPase	[	SERCA2	]	)	,	and	determination	of	plasma	LA	.	.
a10406016.s9	Acute	white_matter_edema	and	eventual	neuronal_loss	in	the	striatum	adjacent	to	the	hematoma	did	not	differ	between	the	two	groups	.	.
a20080419.s5	Over	the	long	-	term	chronic	phase	(	120	days	after	transplantation	)	,	only	25	%	of	BMC	-	treated	epileptic	animals	had	seizures	,	but	with	a	lower	frequency	and	duration	compared	to	the	epileptic	control	group	.	.
a11334364.s2	This	study	assessed	the	ability	of	IH636_grape_seed_proanthocyanidin_extract	(	GSPE	)	to	prevent	acetaminophen	(	AAP)-induced	nephrotoxicity	,	amiodarone	(	AMI)-induced	lung_toxicity	,	and	doxorubicin	(	DOX)-induced	cardiotoxicity	in	mice	.	.
a16755009.s4	Diazepam-	,	scopolamine-	and	ageing	-	induced	amnesia	served	as	the	interoceptive	behavioral	models	.	.
a11807648.s1	BACKGROUND	,	Fibrin	sealants	(	FS	)	derived	from	human	plasma	are	frequently	used	in	neurosurgery	.	.
a3403780.s2	The	diagnostic	difficulty	at	presentation	is	highlighted	.	.
a2425813.s2	In	the	liver	both	the	content	of	RNA	and	the	biosynthesis	of	ribosomal	RNA	increased	while	both	the	RNA	content	and	ribosomal	RNA	biosynthesis	were	reduced	in	the	gastrocnemius	muscle	.	.
a17343925.s4	METHODS	,	This	study	was	undertaken	as	part	of	neonatal	screening	for	hearing_impairment	and	involved	both	ears	of	200	newborns	.	.
a8864707.s4	In	addition	,	we	performed	a	high	-	resolution	3D	gradient	echo	,	T1-weighted	sequences	at	a	1-mm	slice	thickness	.	.
a10683478.s3	From	such	experiments	there	is	evidence	that	characterization	and	detection	of	apomorphine	-	induced	activity	in	rodents	critically	depends	upon	the	test	conditions	employed	.	.
a17244258.s0	In	vitro	characterization	of	parasympathetic	and	sympathetic	responses	in	cyclophosphamide	-	induced	cystitis	in	the	rat	.	.
a19759529.s4	Among	them	are	glycine	transporter-1	(	GlyT1	)	inhibitors	such	as	SSR103800	,	which	indirectly	enhance	NMDA	receptor	function	by	increasing	the	glycine	(	a	co	-	agonist	for	the	NMDA	receptor	)	levels	in	the	synapse	.	.
a9100294.s0	Cardiovascular_alterations	in	rat	fetuses	exposed	to	calcium	channel	blockers	.	.
a17437408.s14	Furthermore	,	our	data	suggest	that	TR(-	)	rats	are	an	interesting	tool	to	study	consequences	of	overexpression	of	Pgp	in	the	BBB	on	access	of	drugs	in	the	brain	,	without	the	need	of	inducing	seizures	or	other	Pgp	-	enhancing	events	for	this	purpose	.	.
a18560792.s4	METHODS	,	All	PD	patients	in	the	Amiens	area	treated	with	pergolide	were	invited	to	attend	a	cardiologic	assessment	including	transthoracic	echocardiography	.	.
a8092427.s7	We	selected	the	54	(	30.5	%	)	cases	of	immediate	AX	allergy	with	good	tolerance	of	PG	.	.
a3719553.s0	Allergic_reaction	to	5-fluorouracil	infusion	.	.
a1009330.s2	The	results	have	shown	that	the	degradation	product	p	-	choloroaniline	is	not	a	significant	factor	in	chlorhexidine	-	digluconate	associated	erosive	cystitis	.	.
a21029050.s4	METHODS	,	a	total	of	13	patients	were	referred	to	the	Danish	Cholinesterase	Research	Unit	after	ECT	during	38	months	.	.
a18631865.s2	Because	proteinuria	is	a	major	predictive	factor	of	poor	transplantation	outcome	,	many	studies	focused	on	this	adverse	event	during	the	past	years	.	.
a21029050.s9	Severe	distress	was	noted	in	the	recovery	phase	in	two	patients	.	.
a3371379.s1	Two	patients	with	signs	of	carbamazepine	neurotoxicity	after	combined	treatment	with	verapamil	showed	complete	recovery	after	discontinuation	of	the	calcium	entry	blocker	.	.
a11672959.s6	It	is	thought	that	the	clinico	-	pathological	features	and	chronology	of	this	case	bore	the	hallmarks	of	the	so	-	called	"	3-week_sulphasalazine	syndrome	"	,	a	rare	,	but	often	fatal	,	immunoallergic	reaction	to_sulphasalazine	.	.
a12789195.s2	Significant	disfiguring	changes	occur	as	a	result	of	bone	,	cartilage	,	and	soft	tissue	hypertrophy	,	including	the	thickening	of	the	skin	,	coarsening	of	facial	features	,	and	cutis_verticis_gyrata	.	.
a20520283.s3	With	last	observations	carried	forward	(	LOCF	)	,	mean	Positive	and	Negative	Syndrome	Scale	total	score	reductions	from	baseline	to	endpoint	were	significantly	greater	with	asenapine	at	5	mg	BID	(	-16.2	)	and	haloperidol	(	-15.4	)	than	placebo	(	-10.7	,	both	P	<	0.05	)	,	using	mixed	model	for	repeated	measures	(	MMRM	)	,	changes	at	day	42	were	significantly	greater	with	asenapine	at	5	and	10	mg	BID	(	-21.3	and	-19.4	,	respectively	)	and	haloperidol	(	-20.0	)	than	placebo	(	-14.6	,	all	P	<	0.05	)	.	.
a15145918.s6	SDRR	was	reduced	only	by	alpha	-	methyldopa	.	.
a18162529.s8	Lastly	,	we	measured	PRL	-	R	and	suppressor	of	cytokine	signaling	(	SOCS-1	and	-3	and	CIS	,	which	reflect	the	level	of	prolactin	signaling	)	mRNAs	in	response	to	sulpiride	and	estradiol	.	.
a10526274.s19	This	age	group	had	an	increased	risk	of	myelosuppression	.	.
a6203452.s4	Because	each	patient	was	tumor	-	free	or	had	only	a	small	tumor	at	the	onset	of	this	syndrome	,	the	thrombotic_microangiopathy	may	have	been	induced	by	chemotherapy	.	.
a2559236.s2	Rats	were	given	a	single	dose	of	adriamycin	and	one	month	later	divided	into	four	groups	matched	for	albuminuria	,	blood	pressure	,	and	plasma	albumin	concentration	.	.
a20067456.s10	The	ASEX	score	and	CGI	-	SF	score	were	correlated	(	P=	0.003	)	.	.
a8643971.s18	Paclitaxel	/	cisplatin	is	an	effective	first	-	line	regimen	for	locoregionally	advanced	head_and_neck_cancer	and	continued	study	is	warranted	.	.
a11007689.s10	Patients	who	are	switched	from	cyclosporine	to	tacrolimus	or	vice	versa	should	be	closely	monitored	for	the	signs	and	symptoms	of	recurrent	TMA	.	.
a12523465.s8	Further	observations	and	reports	will	help	clarify	this	adverse	effect	.	.
a18162529.s11	Interestingly	,	estradiol	also	induced	PRL	-	R	,	SOCS-3	,	and	CIS	mRNA	levels	independently	.	.
a10743446.s10	The	differential	effects	of	ketamine	and	lidocaine	on	static	and	dynamic	hyperalgesia	suggest	that	the	two	types	of	hyperalgesia	are	mediated	by	separate	mechanisms	and	have	a	distinct	pharmacology	.	.
a17261653.s8	As	a	consequence	of	blocking	I(f	)	,	clonidine	reduced	the	slope	of	the	diastolic	depolarization	and	the	frequency	of	pacemaker	potentials	in	sinoatrial	node	cells	from	wild	-	type	and	alpha2ABC	-	knockout	mice	.	.

a9698967.s5	Both	the	temporal	relationship	of	events	and	the	response	to	treatment	suggest	that	a	rapid	systemic	absorption	of	mepivacaine	with	adrenaline	and/or	interaction	of	these	drugs	with	the	patient	's	cardiovascular	medications	were	responsible	for	the	perioperative	complications	.	.
a11007689.s7	However	,	literature	regarding	the	incidence	of	the	recurrence	of	TMA	in	patients	exposed	sequentially	to	cyclosporine	and	tacrolimus	is	limited	.	.

a809711.s7	Our	results	suggest	that	addition	of	phenylephrine	to	nitroglycerin	is	not	beneficial	in	the	treatment	of	patients	with	acute_myocardial_infarction	.	.
a7890216.s7	Of	the	12	patients	considered	for	oral	ursodeoxycholic_acid	(	UDCA	)	treatment	,	two	had	a	blocked	cystic	duct	and	were	not	started	on	UDCA	while	one	was	lost	to	follow	up	.	.

a10091617.s7	A	lesser	degree	of	orthostatic_hypotension	occurred	with	standing	.	.
a9522152.s5	However	,	we	suggest	that	a	low	solution	concentration	should	be	preferred	for	unilateral	spinal	anaesthesia	with	a	hyperbaric	anaesthetic	solution	(	if	pencil	-	point	needle	and	slow	injection	rate	are	employed	)	,	in	order	to	minimize	the	risk	of	a	localized	high	peak	anaesthetic	concentration	,	which	might	lead	to	a	transient	neurological_deficit	.	.
a20619828.s8	This	novel	model	of	OCD	demonstrates	that	drug	exposure	during	a	sensitive	period	can	program	disease	-	like	systems	permanently	,	which	could	have	implications	for	current	and	future	therapeutic	strategies	for	this	and	other	psychiatric_disorders	.	.

a347884.s10	No	differences	were	observed	with	respect	to	side	effects	and	general	tolerability	.	.
a17639754.s4	We	report	3	cases	of	serious	bleeding	complications	that	appear	to	be	the	result	of	the	interaction	between	warfarin	and	levofloxacin	.	.
a6747681.s5	In	the	nine	responders	,	median	duration	of	chemotherapy	response	from	the	time	of	operation	was	25	weeks	(	range	12	to	more	than	91	weeks	)	.	.
