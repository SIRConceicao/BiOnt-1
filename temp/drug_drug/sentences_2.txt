DDI-DrugBank.d72.s0	Itraconazole	decreases	busulfan	clearance	by	up	to	25	%	,	and	may	produce	AUCs	__	1500	_	M	min	in	some	patients	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d29.s3	Drug	interaction	studies	have	shown	that	esomeprazole	does	not	have	any	clinically	significant	interactions	with	phenytoin	,	warfarin	,	quinidine	,	clarithromycin	or	amoxicillin	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d331.s4	-	Probenecid	,	Pretreatment	with	probenecid	reduces	both	the	natriuresis	and	hyperreninemia	produced	by	bumetanide	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d324.s13	However	,	the	pharmacodynamics	of	coadministration	of	zaleplon	and	promethazine	have	not	been	evaluated	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d135.s5	Acute	dosing	with	clozapine	failed	to	alter	the	behavioral	effects	of	PCP	in	either	procedure	even	when	tested	up	to	doses	that	produced	pharmacological	effects	alone	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d426.s1	Due	to	a	theoretical	risk	of	a	pharmacodynamic	interaction	,	use	of	ergotamine	-	containing	or	ergot	-	type_medications	(	like	dihydroergotamine	or	methysergide	)	and	FROVA	within	24	hours	of	each	other	should	be	avoided	(	see	_	a	href=	frova_od.htm#CI	CONTRAINDICATIONS	)	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d328.s13	Patients	already	stabilized	on	valdecoxib	should	be	closely	monitored	for	loss	of	symptom	control	with	phenytoin	coadministration	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d219.s11	Nevertheless	,	clinical	studies	,	as	well	as	postmarketing	observations	have	shown	that	Lodine	can	reduce	the	natriuretic	effect	of	furosemide	and	thiazides	in	some	patients	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d338.s6	Consequently	,	estazolam	should	be	avoided	in	patients	receiving	ketoconazole	and	itraconazole	,	which	are	very	potent	inhibitors	of	CYP3A.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d527.s1	The	following	are	examples	of	substances	that	may	increase	the	blood	-	glucose	-	lowering	effect	and	susceptibility	to	hypoglycemia	,	oral	antidiabetes	products	,	ACE_inhibitors	,	disopyramide	,	fibrates	,	fluoxetine	,	MAO_inhibitors	,	propoxyphene	,	salicylates	,	somatostatin_analog	(	e.g.	,	octreotide	)	,	sulfonamide_antibiotics	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d98.s11	Corticosteroids	,	A	relationship	of	functional	antagonism	exists	between	vitamin_D_analogues	,	which	promote	calcium	absorption	,	and	corticosteroids	,	which	inhibit	calcium	absorption	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d509.s19	Carbamazepine	,	Coadministration	of	carbamazepine	(	200	mg	BID	)	,	a	potent	CYP3A4	inducer	,	with	aripiprazole	(	30	mg	QD	)	resulted	in	an	approximate	70	%	decrease	in	Cmax	and	AUC	values	of	both	aripiprazole	and	its	active	metabolite	,	dehydro	-	aripiprazole	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d132.s6	Limited	comparative	data	in	patients	with	high	viral	loads	treated	with	nevirapine-	or	delavirdine	-	based	regimens	currently	exist	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d444.s0	The	use	of	FLUDARA	FOR	INJECTION	in	combination	with	pentostatin	is	not	recommended	due	to	the	risk	of	severe	pulmonary	toxicity	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d564.s4	Concurrent	administration	of	vasopressor_drugs	(	for	the	treatment	of	hypotension	related	to	obstetric	blocks	)	and	ergot	-	type_oxytocic_drugs	may	cause	severe	,	persistent	hypertension	or	cerebrovascular	accidents	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d314.s22	Ketoconazole	,	Ketoconazole	has	been	reported	to	decrease	the	metabolism	of	certain	corticosteroids	by	up	to	60	%	,	leading	to	increased	risk	of	corticosteroid	side	effects	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d143.s59	There	have	been	reports	of	QTc	prolongation	,	with	or	without	TdP	,	in	patients	taking	amiodarone	when	fluoroquinolones	,	macrolide_antibiotics	,	or	azoles	were	administered	concomitantly	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d224.s2	Tricyclic_antidepressants	have	been	reported	to	blunt	the	hypotensive	effect	of	systemic	clonidine	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d172.s24	However	,	caution	should	be	used	when	administering	CELEBREX	with	warfarin	since	these	patients	are	at	increased	risk	of	bleeding	complications	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d110.s14	While	18-MC	and	ibogaine	have	similar	affinities	for	kappa	opioid	and	possibly	nicotinic	receptors	,	18-MC	has	much	lower	affinities	than	ibogaine	for	NMDA	and	sigma-2	receptors	,	sodium	channels	,	and	the	5-HT	transporter	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d416.s3	Therefore	,	patients	receiving	probenecid	will	have	erroneously	low	ERPF	and	Tm	PAH	values	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d560.s1	If	you	are	also	using	a	steroid	inhaler	,	take	bitolterol	first	and	then	wait	about	15	minutes	before	using	the	steroid	inhaler	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d179.s39	-	Methyldopa	(	e.g.	,	Aldomet	)	Use	of	methyldopa	with	sulfapyridine	may	increase	the	chance	of	side	effects	affecting	the	liver	and/or	the	blood	.
DDI-DrugBank.d103.s10	It	is	important	that	patients	understand	how	to	use	FORADIL	_	(	formoterol_fumarate	)	capsules	with	the	supplied	AerolizerTM	inhalation	device	and	how	it	should	be	used	in	relation	to	other	asthma	or	COPD	medications	they	are	taking	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d97.s26	Combinations	of	these	drugs	have	not	been	studied	and	coadministration	of	CRIXIVAN	and	atazanavir	is	not	recommended	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d60.s3	During	phenytoin	and	fluvoxamine	treatment	,	ataxia	,	a	typical	side	effect	of	phenytoin	,	was	observed	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d328.s10	Furosemide	,	Clinical	studies	,	as	well	as	post	-	marketing	observations	,	have	shown	that	NSAIDs	can	reduce	the	natriuretic	effect	of	furosemide	and	thiazides	in	some	patients	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d216.s16	Warfarin	,	Eszopiclone	3	mg	administered	daily	for	5	days	did	not	affect	the	pharmacokinetics	of_(R)-	or	(	S)-warfarin	,	nor	were	there	any	changes	in	the	pharmacodynamic	profile	(	prothrombin	time	)	following	a	single	25	mg	oral	dose	of	warfarin	.
DDI-DrugBank.d257.s0	Interactions	with	Other	CNS	Agents	,	Concurrent	use	of	Levo	-	Dromoran	with	all	central_nervous_system_depressants	(	eg	,	alcohol	,	sedatives	,	hypnotics	,	other	opioids	,	general	anesthetics	,	barbiturates	,	tricyclic_antidepressants	,	phenothiazines	,	tranquilizers	,	skeletal_muscle_relaxants	and	antihistamines	)	may	result	in	additive	central	nervous	system	depressant	effects	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d76.s24	Moreover	,	as	noted	with	alprazolam	,	the	effect	of	fluvoxamine	may	even	be	more	pronounced	when	it	is	administered	at	higher	doses	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d170.s2	The	concomitant	use	of	transdermal	fentanyl	with	ritonavir	or	other	potent	3A4	inhibitors	such	as	ketoconazole	,	itraconazole	,	troleandomycin	,	clarithromycin	,	nelfinavir	,	and	nefazadone	may	result	in	an	increase	in	fentanyl	plasma	concentrations	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d67.s0	Effect	of	diazepam	and	midazolam	on	the	antinociceptive	effect	of	morphine	,	metamizol	and	indomethacin	in	mice	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d238.s2	Anafranil	should	not	be	used	with	MAO_inhibitors	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d249.s1	Anticoagulants	,	While	studies	have	not	shown	diclofenac	to	interact	with	anticoagulants_of_the_warfarin_type	,	caution	should	be	exercised	,	nonetheless	,	since	interactions	have	been	seen	with	other	NSAIDs	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d114.s8	Myocardial	injury	,	including	myocardial	infarction	,	myocarditis	,	ventricular	hypokinesia	,	and	severe	rhabdomyolysis	appear	to	be	increased	in	patients	receiving	PROLEUKIN	and	interferon	-	alfa	concurrently	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d500.s6	Concurrent	use	of	tetracycline	may	render	oral	contraceptives	less	effective	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d367.s4	In	a	placebo	-	controlled	trial	in	normal	volunteers	,	the	administration	of	a	single	1	mg	dose	of	doxazosin	on	day	1	of	a	four	-	day	regimen	of	oral	cimetidine	(	400	mg	twice	daily	)	resulted	in	a	10	%	increase	in	mean	AUC	of	doxazosin	(	p=0.006	)	,	and	a	slight	but	not	statistically	significant	increase	in	mean	Cmax	and	mean	half	-	life	of	doxazosin	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d76.s20	Because	fluvoxamine	reduces	the	clearance	of	both	diazepam	and	its	active	metabolite	,	N	-	desmethyldiazepam	,	there	is	a	strong	likelihood	of	substantial	accumulation	of	both	species	during	chronic	co	-	administration	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d18.s0	Tablets	,	The	benzodiazepines	,	including	lorazepam	,	produce	CNS	-	depressant	effects	when	administered	with	such	medications	as	barbiturates	or	alcohol	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d368.s6	Acetazolamide	may	increase	the	effects	of	other	folic_acid_antagonists	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d476.s1	Patients	receiving	catecholamine	-	depleting	drugs	,	such	as	reserpine	or	guanethidine	,	should	be	closely	monitored	,	because	the	added	beta	-	adrenergic	blocking	action	of	ZEBETA	may	produce	excessive	reduction	of	sympathetic	activity	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d203.s2	Compounds	tested	in	man	include	warfarin	,	theophylline	,	phenytoin	,	diazepam	,	aminopyrine	and	antipyrine	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d314.s15	Digitalis_glycosides	,	Patients	on	digitalis_glycosides	may	be	at	increased	risk	of	arrhythmias	due	to	hypokalemia	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d350.s9	There	were	transient	increases	in	liver	ALT	and	AST	when	CANCIDAS	and	cyclosporine	were	co	-	administered	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d526.s1	Amphotericin_B	or	potassium	-	depleting_diuretics	(	benzothiadiazines	and	related	drugs	,	ethacrynic_acid	and	furosemide	)	enhanced	hypokalemia	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d529.s2	Anticoagulants	,	Flurbiprofen	like	other	nonsteroidal_anti	-	inflammatory_drugs	,	has	been	shown	to	affect	bleeding	parameters	in	patients	receiving	anti	-	coagulants	,	and	serious	clinical	bleeding	has	been	reported	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d339.s2	Warfarin	and	Anticoagulants	,	Increased	prothrombin	time	,	with	or	without	clinical	bleeding	,	has	been	reported	when	cefixime	is	administered	concomitantly	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d258.s4	Plasma	concentrations	(	AUC	0	-	24	hrs	)	of	erythromycin	decreased	15	%	with	coadministration	of	loratadine	relative	to	that	observed	with	erythromycin	alone	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d283.s4	Resins	,	Since	bile_acid_sequestrants	may	bind	other	drugs	given	concurrently	,	patients	should	take	TRICOR	at	least	1	hour	before	or	4	-	6	hours	after	a	bile_acid_binding_resin	to	avoid	impeding	its	absorption	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d115.s4	Co	-	medications	that	induce	CYP3A4	(	e.g.	,	dexamethasone	,	phenytoin	,	carbamazepine	,	rifampin	,	phenobarbital	or	St.	.
DDI-MedLine.d46.s1	STUDY	OBJECTIVE	,	To	evaluate	the	effect	of	fluoxetine	on	the	pharmacokinetics	and	cardiovascular	safety	of	cisapride	at	steady	state	in	healthy	men	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d516.s24	Warfarin	,	Quinolones	may	enhance	the	effects	of	the	oral	anticoagulant	,	warfarin	,	or	its	derivatives	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d117.s0	Concomitant	use	with	iron_supplements	may	result	in	the	reduced	absorption	of	iron	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d84.s4	The	antimicrobial	combinations	of	GL	with	four	antibiotics	resulted	in	additive	effect	in	most	instances	,	synergism	in	two	instances	,	and	antagonism	in	two	instances	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d234.s4	Although	ROMAZICON	exerts	a	slight	intrinsic	anticonvulsant	effect	,	its	abrupt	suppression	of	the	protective	effect	of	a	benzodiazepine	agonist	can	give	rise	to	convulsions	in	epileptic	patients	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d519.s3	Laboratory	Tests	Response	to	Plenaxis	should	be	monitored	by	measuring	serum	total	testosterone	concentrations	just	prior	to	administration	on	Day	29	and	every	8	weeks	thereafter	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d207.s7	Drugs	that	cause	significant	sustained	elevation	in	gastric	pH	(	histamine_H2-receptor_antagonists	such	as	ranitidine	or	cimetidine	)	may	reduce	plasma	concentrations	of	IRESSA	and	therefore	potentially	may	reduce	efficacy	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d94.s16	Additionally	,	anti	-	malarial_drugs	,	such	as	chloroquine	and	mefloquine	,	may	antagonize	the	activity	of	carbamazepine	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d163.s13	No	formal	clinical	studies	have	been	conducted	to	assess	if	there	is	an	interactive	effect	on	bone	loss	between	phenytoin	and	Accutane	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d357.s0	5HT3_Antagonists	,	Based	on	reports	of	profound	hypotension	and	loss	of	consciousness	when	apomorphine	was	administered	with	ondansetron	,	the	concomitant	use	of	apomorphine	with	drugs	of	the	5HT3_antagonist_class	(	including	,	for	example	,	ondansetron	,	granisetron	,	dolasetron	,	palonosetron	,	and	alosetron	)	is	contraindicated	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d162.s5	Single	doses	of	either	cholestyramine	or	colestipol	resins	bind	the	hydrochlorothiazide	and	reduce	its	absorption	from	the	gastrointestinal	tract	by	up	to	85	and	43	percent	,	respectively	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d289.s21	Bosentan	is	also	expected	to	reduce	plasma	concentrations	of	other	oral	hypoglycemic_agents	that	are	predominantly	metabolized	by	CYP2C9	or	CYP3A4	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d82.s7	In	post	-	marketing	experience	,	bleeding	has	been	reported	in	patients	on	concomitant	treatment	with	anticoagulants	and	INDOCIN	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d416.s2	Probenecid	depresses	tubular	secretion	of	certain	weak	acids	such	as	PAH	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d328.s4	Aspirin	,	Concomitant	administration	of	aspirin	with	valdecoxib	may	result	in	an	increased	risk	of	GI	ulceration	and	complications	compared	to	valdecoxib	alone	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d3.s3	In	vitro	studies	indicate	that	,	at	therapeutic	concentrations	of	salicylate	(	300	m	g	/	mL	)	,	the	binding	of	ketorolac	was	reduced	from	approximately	99.2	%	to	97.5	%	,	representing	a	potential	twofold	increase	in	unbound	ketorolac	plasma	levels	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d124.s10	It	was	concluded	that	oral	oxycodone	and	levofloxacin	can	be	administered	concomitantly	without	a	significant	decrease	in	AUC	,	Cmax	,	or	tmax	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d224.s1	Although	no	specific	drug	interactions	with	topical	glaucoma	drugs	or	systemic	medications	were	identified	in	clinical	studies	of	IOPIDINE	0.5	%	Ophthalmic	Solution	,	the	possibility	of	an	additive	or	potentiating	effect	with	CNS_depressants	(	alcohol	,	barbiturates	,	opiates	,	sedatives	,	anesthetics	)	should	be	considered	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d310.s4	This	effect	may	be	mediated	by	the	known	inhibition	of	hepatic	cytochrome	P-	450	by	cimetidine	,	which	could	decrease	first	pass	metabolism	of	nimodipine	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d394.s0	The	hypotensive	effect	of	sodium_nitroprusside	is	augmented	by	that	of	most	other	hypotensive_drugs	,	including	ganglionic_blocking_agents	,	negative	inotropic	agents	,	and	inhaled	anesthetics	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d76.s17	This	interaction	,	which	has	not	been	investigated	using	higher	doses	of	fluvoxamine	,	may	be	more	pronounced	if	a	300	mg	daily	dose	is	co	-	administered	,	particularly	since	fluvoxamine	exhibits	non	-	linear	pharmacokinetics	over	the	dosage	range	100	-	300	mg	.	If	alprazolam	is	co	-	administered	with	Fluvoxamine	Tablets	,	the	initial	alprazolam	dosage	should	be	at	least	halved	and	titration	to	the	lowest	effective	dose	is	recommended	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d75.s10	It	is	known	that	CYP1A2	is	inhibited	by	several	medicinal	products	,	including	fluvoxamine	,	and	such	medicinal	products	could	theoretically	adversely	influence	the	clearance	of	anagrelide	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d57.s0	In	vitro	mixing	of	an	aminoglycoside	with	beta	-	lactamtype	antibiotics	(	penicillins	or	cephalosporins	)	may	result	in	a	significant	mutual	inactivation	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d550.s1	Although	the	clinical	significance	is	not	known	,	it	is	not	recommended	that	cefditoren_pivoxil	be	taken	concomitantly	with	antacids	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d529.s10	Flurbiprofen	did	not	affect	the	pharmacokinetic	profile	of	either	drug	,	and	the	mechanism	under	lying	the	interference	with	propranolols	hypotensive	effect	is	unknown	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d165.s19	The	physician	is	advised	to	monitor	the	plasma	concentrations	of	itraconazole	when	any	of	these	drugs	is	taken	concurrently	,	and	to	increase	the	dose	of	Itraconazole	if	necessary	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d236.s29	Drug	/	Laboratory	Test	Interactions	,	Amphetamines	can	cause	a	significant	elevation	in	plasma	corticosteroid	levels	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d434.s22	Valproate	,	Felbatol	_	causes	an	increase	in	steady	-	state	valproate	concentrations	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d488.s1	Therefore	,	when	heparin_sodium	is	given	with	dicumarol	or	warfarin_sodium	,	a	period	of	at	least	5	hours	after	the	last	intravenous	dose	or	24	hours	after	the	last	subcutaneous	dose	should	elapse	before	blood	is	drawn	if	a	valid	prothrombin	time	is	to	be	obtained	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d135.s8	Carbamazepine	,	In	healthy	subjects	receiving	the	CYP3A4	inducer	,	carbamazepine	,	at	100	mg	twice	daily	for	3	days	and	200	mg	twice	daily	for	17	days	,	systemic	exposure	(	AUC	)	to	lapatinib	was	decreased	approximately	72	%	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d273.s0	Drug	-	Drug	Interactions	,	The	pharmacokinetic	and	pharmacodynamic	interactions	between	UROXATRAL	and	other	alpha	-	blockers	have	not	been	determined	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d97.s4	Coadministration	of	CRIXIVAN	and	other	drugs	that	inhibit	CYP3A4	may	decrease	the	clearance	of	indinavir	and	may	result	in	increased	plasma	concentrations	of	indinavir	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d185.s2	Notably	,	systemic	exposure	(	AUC0	-	12	)	of	dapsone_hydroxylamine	(	DHA	)	was	more	than	doubled	in	the	presence	of	TMP	/	SMX	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d77.s2	Avoid	the	use	of	preparations	such	as	decongestants	and	local	anesthetics	which	contain	any	sympathomimetic_amine	(	e.g.	,	epinephrine	,	norepinephrine	)	,	since	it	has	been	reported	that	tricyclic_antidepressants	can	potentiate	the	effects	of	catecholamines	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d198.s40	Aspirin	,	Vardenafil	(	10	mg	and	20	mg	)	did	not	potentiate	the	increase	in	bleeding	time	caused	by	aspirin	(	two	81	mg	tablets	)	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d206.s0	Results	of	preliminary	studies	in	humans	and	rats	suggest	that	nonabsorbable	antacids	given	concurrently	with	lactulose	may	inhibit	the	desired	lactulose	-	induced	drop	in	colonic	pH.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d468.s9	Plasma	concentrations	of	cyclosporine	should	therefore	be	closely	monitored	,	and	its	dosage	reduced	accordingly	,	in	patients	treated	with	nicardipine	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d460.s5	Metformin	,	When	Starlix	120	mg	three	times	daily	before	meals	was	administered	in	combination	with	metformin	500	mg	three	times	daily	to	patients	with	Type	2	diabetes	,	there	were	no	clinically	relevant	changes	in	the	pharmacokinetics	of	either	agent	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d48.s11	Exposed	histidines	on	toxin_A	are	available	for	zinc	chelation	,	and	these	have	been	exploited	in	the	development	of	a	novel	purification	protocol	for	toxin_A	using	zinc	-	chelating	chromatography	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d529.s11	Patients	taking	both	flurbiprofen	and	a	beta	-	blocker	should	be	monitored	to	ensure	that	a	satisfactory	hypotensive	effect	is	achieved	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d143.s8	Since	amiodarone	is	a	substrate	for	CYP3A4	and	CYP2C8	,	drugs	/	substances	that	inhibit	these	isoenzymes	may	decrease	the	metabolism	and	increase	serum	concentration	of	amiodarone	.	.
