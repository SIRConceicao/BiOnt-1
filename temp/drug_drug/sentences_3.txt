DDI-DrugBank.d18.s1	Injection	,	Lorazepam	injection	,	like	other	injectable	benzodiazepines	,	produces	depression	of	the	central	nervous	system	when	administered	with	ethyl_alcohol	,	phenothiazines	,	barbiturates	,	MAO_inhibitors	,	and	other	antidepressants	.	When	scopolamine	is	used	concomitantly	with	injectable	lorazepam	,	an	increased	incidence	of	sedation	,	hallucinations	,	and	irrational	behavior	has	been	observed	.	.

DDI-DrugBank.d3.s10	Therefore	,	concomitant	use	of	TORADOL	and	probenecid	is	contraindicated	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d86.s0	Pharmacokinetic	interaction	between	single	oral	doses	of	diltiazem	and	sirolimus	in	healthy	volunteers	.	_	.
DDI-MedLine.d124.s6	1	hour	after	starting	the	oxycodone	or	levofloxacin	500	mg	p.o	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d198.s38	Alcohol	,	Alcohol	(	0.5	g	/	kg	body	weight	,	approximately	40	mL	of	absolute	alcohol	in	a	70	kg	person	)	and	vardenafil	plasma	levels	were	not	altered	when	dosed	simultaneously	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d462.s7	Methotrexate	,	Piperacillin_sodium	may	reduce	the	excretion	of	methotrexate	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d219.s18	Thus	,	when	NSAIDs	and	lithium	are	administered	concurrently	,	subjects	should	be	observed	carefully	for	signs	of	lithium	toxicity	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d165.s4	Another	oral	azole_antifungal	,	ketoconazole	,	inhibits	the	metabolism	of	astemizole	,	resulting	in	elevated	plasma	concentrations	of	astemizole	and	its	active	metabolite	desmethylastermizole	which	may	prolong	QT	intervals	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d116.s5	This	effect	may	be	mediated	by	the	ability	of	rifampin	to	induce	microsomal	enzymes	and	,	thus	,	the	catabolism	of	warfarin	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d93.s4	Thirty	male	rats	of	the	Fischer-344	strain	were	divided	into	three	equal	groups	and	were	given	injections	of	trimethyl_lead	(	TML	)	(	8.0	or	17.0	mg	/	kg	/	ml	SC	)	or	the	saline	vehicle	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d530.s1	Concomitant	use	of	L	-	phenylalanine	and	non	-	selective_MAO_inhibitors	may	cause	hypertension	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d410.s2	Sumatriptan	and	D.H.E._45	_	(	dihydroergotamine_mesylate	)	Injection	,	USP	should	not	be	taken	within	24	hours	of	each	other	..	.
DDI-DrugBank.d460.s6	Digoxin	,	When	Starlix	120	mg	before	meals	was	administered	in	combination	with	a	single	1-mg	dose	of	digoxin	to	healthy	volunteers	,	there	were	no	clinically	relevant	changes	in	the	pharmacokinetics	of	either	agent	.	.
