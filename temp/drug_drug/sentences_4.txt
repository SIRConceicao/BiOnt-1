DDI-MedLine.d105.s9	Based	on	the	results	of	these	studies	,	it	is	concluded	that	azithromycin	may	be	safely	coadministered	with	both	zidovudine	and	dideoxyinosine	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d134.s1	An	intravenous	dose	of	50	mg	perchlorate	was	in	respect	of	competitive	suppression	of	organs	actively	concentrating	pertechnetate	as	effective	as	intravenous	1000	mg	ClO-4-	simultaneously	or	1000	mg	orally	30	min	before	the	injection	of	radiopertechnetate	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d295.s0	Since	entecavir	is	primarily	eliminated	by	the	kidneys	,	coadministration	of	BARACLUDE	with	drugs	that	reduce	renal	function	or	compete	for	active	tubular	secretion	may	increase	serum	concentrations	of	either	entecavir	or	the	coadministered	drug	.	.

DDI-DrugBank.d502.s1	Close	observation	of	the	patient	is	recommended	when	a	beta	-	blocker	is	administered	to	patients	receiving	catecholamine	-	depleting	drugs	such	as	reserpine	,	because	of	possible	additive	effects	and	the	production	of	hypotension	and/or	marked	bradycardia	,	which	may	produce	vertigo	,	syncope	,	or	postural	hypotension	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d516.s23	Terfenadine	,	No	clinically	significant	changes	occurred	in	heart	rate	or	corrected	QT	intervals	,	or	in	terfenadine	metabolite	or	lomefloxacin	pharmacokinetics	,	during	concurrent	administration	of	lomefloxacin	and	terfenadine	at	steady	-	state	in	28	healthy	males	.	.

DDI-DrugBank.d529.s8	Flurbiprofen	pretreatment	attenuated	the	hypotensive	effect	of	a	single	dose	of	propranolol	but	not	atenolol	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d16.s6	It	is	concluded	that	ketamine	is	not	a	short	-	acting	drug	and	that	concomitant	use	with	halothane	would	be	expected	to	prolong	further	the	duration	of	its	action	on	the	central	nervous	system	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d438.s41	Gabapentin	pharmacokinetic	parameters	without	and	with	probenecid	were	comparable	.	.

DDI-DrugBank.d571.s4	Patients	on	oral	antidiabetic_agents	receiving	VELCADE	treatment	may	require	close	monitoring	of	their	blood	glucose	levels	and	adjustment	of	the	dose	of	their	antidiabetic_medication	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d340.s28	Little	or	no	change	in	the	pharmacokinetics	of	either	drug	was	observed	when	VIRACEPT	was	coadministered	with	lamivudine	or	stavudine	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d289.s27	Bosentan	is	also	expected	to	reduce	plasma	concentrations	of	other	statins	that	have	significant	metabolism	by	CYP3A4	,	such	as	lovastatin	and	atorvastatin	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d565.s35	These	pharmacokinetic	effects	seen	during	diltiazem	coadministration	can	result	in	increased	clinical	effects	(	e.g.	,	prolonged	sodation)of	both	midazolam	and	triazolam	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d166.s2	In	particular	,	convulsions	have	been	reported	when	ethionamide	is	administered	with	cycloserine	and	special	care	should	be	taken	when	the	treatment	regimen	includes	both	of	these	drugs	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d175.s6	therefore	,	nitroglycerin	or	other	nitrates	(	as	used	for	management	of	angina	)	or	other	drugs	having	vasodilator	activity	should	,	if	possible	,	be	discontinued	before	starting	captopril	.	.

DDI-DrugBank.d29.s6	Patients	treated	with	proton_pump_inhibitors	and	warfarin	concomitantly	may	need	to	be	monitored	for	increases	in	INR	and	prothrombin	time	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d415.s6	This	may	indicate	that	ibuprofen	could	enhance	the	toxicity	of	methotrexate	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d365.s1	H1	and	H2_Blockers	;	Although	not	reported	,	L	-	histidine	,	via	its	metabolism	to	histamine	,	might	decrease	the	efficacy	of	H1	and	H2_blockers	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d237.s7	Antifungals	,	In	vitro	and/or	in	vivo	data	indicate	that	fluconazole	,	itraconazole	,	and	oral	ketoconazole	markedly	inhibit	the	metabolism	of	cisapride	,	which	can	result	in	an	increase	in	plasma	cisapride	levels	and	prolongation	of	the	QT	interval	on	the	ECG	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d99.s14	It	is	desirable	to	monitor	TCA	plasma	levels	whenever	a	TCA	is	going	to	be	coadministered	with	another	drug	known	to	be	an	inhibitor	of	P450	2D6	.	.

DDI-DrugBank.d458.s20	In	simultaneous	treatment	with	imidazole_drugs	and	coumarin_drugs	,	the	anticoagulant	effect	should	be	carefully	titrated	and	monitored	.	.

DDI-DrugBank.d51.s2	Anticholinergic_agents	,	Although	ipratropium_bromide	is	minimally	absorbed	into	the	systemic	circulation	,	there	is	some	potential	for	an	additive	interaction	with	concomitantly	used	anticholinergic_medications	.	.
