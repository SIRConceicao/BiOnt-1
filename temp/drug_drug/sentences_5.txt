DDI-DrugBank.d404.s7	Digitalis	,	Vitamin_D	dosage	must	be	determined	with	care	in	patients	undergoing	treatment	with	digitalis	,	as	hypercalcemia	in	such	patients	may	precipitate	cardiac	arrhythmias	.	.

DDI-DrugBank.d373.s7	Since	there	have	been	isolated	reports	of	patients	with	elevated	digoxin	levels	,	it	is	recommended	that	digoxin	levels	be	monitored	when	initiating	,	adjusting	,	and	discontinuing	nifedipine	to	avoid	possible	over-	or	under	-	digitalization	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d485.s22	Example	inducers	include	aminoglutethimide	,	carbamazepine	,	nafcillin	,	nevirapine	,	phenobarbital	,	phenytoin	,	and	rifamycins	.	.

DDI-DrugBank.d494.s1	Using	calcium_acetate	with	digitalis_glycosides	(	heart	medicine	)	may	cause	hypercalcemia	(	too	much	calcium	in	the	blood	)	,	which	could	increase	the	chance	of	developing	an	irregular	heartbeat	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d157.s1	(	See	CLINICAL	PHARMACOLOGY	)	Coadministration	of	Femara	and	tamoxifen	20	mg	daily	resulted	in	a	reduction	of	letrozole	plasma	levels	by	38	%	on	average	.	.

DDI-DrugBank.d465.s0	The	vasodilating	effects	of	isosorbide_dinitrate	may	be	additive	with	those	of	other	vasodilators	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d190.s1	However	,	since	there	is	an	increased	risk	of	bleeding	with	Xigris	,	caution	should	be	employed	when	Xigris	is	used	with	other	drugs	that	affect	hemostasis	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d565.s33	Studies	showed	that	diltiazem	increased	the	AUC	of	midazolam	and	triazolam	by	3	-	4	fold	and	the	Cmax	by	2-fold	,	compared	to	placebo	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d51.s4	However	,	the	antagonism	of	the	theophylline	-	induced	anxiogenic	effects	by	CGS21680	was	only	observed	in	the	time	spent	in	the	light	zone	,	and	DPCPX	-	induced	anxiogenic	effects	were	neither	reversed	by	CGS_21680	nor	by	CPA	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d198.s11	It	is	recommended	not	to	exceed	a	single	2.5	mg	Vardenafil	dose	in	a	24-hour	period	when	used	in	combination	with	indinavir	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d216.s3	Olanzapine	,	Coadministration	of	eszopiclone	3	mg	and	olanzapine	10	mg	produced	a	decrease	in	DSST	scores	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d395.s8	If	signs	and	symptoms	suggestive	of	digoxin	toxicity	occur	when	enoxacin	and	digoxin	are	given	concomitantly	,	physicians	are	advised	to	obtain	serum	digoxin	levels	and	adjust	digoxin	doses	appropriately	.	.

DDI-DrugBank.d320.s2	Thus	agents	likely	to	be	concomitantly	administered	with	Chirocaine	that	are	metabolized	by	this	isoenzyme	family	may	potentially	interact	with	Chirocaine	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d404.s2	Phenytoin	/	Phenobarbital	,	The	coadministration	of	phenytoin	or	phenobarbital	will	not	affect	plasma	concentrations	of	vitamin_D	,	but	may	reduce	endogenous	plasma	levels	of	calcitriol	/	ergocalcitriol	by	accelerating	metabolism	.	.

DDI-DrugBank.d47.s7	Although	metoclopramide	may	increase	the	bioavailability	of	levodopa	by	increasing	gastric	emptying	,	metoclopramide	may	also	adversely	affect	disease	control	by	its	dopamine	receptor	antagonistic	properties	.	.

DDI-DrugBank.d331.s5	This	antagonistic	effect	of	probenecid	on	bumetanide	natriuresis	is	not	due	to	a	direct	action	on	sodium	excretion	but	is	probably	secondary	to	its	inhibitory	effect	on	renal	tubular	secretion	of	bumetanide	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d94.s18	Because	of	its	primary	CNS	effect	,	caution	should	be	used	when	EQUETROTM	is	taken	with	other	centrally_acting_drugs	and	alcohol	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d82.s25	(	Indomethacin	)	diuretics	are	used	concomitantly	,	the	patient	should	be	observed	closely	to	determine	if	the	desired	effect	of	the	diuretic	is	obtained	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d232.s2	Results	of	studies	in	multiple	sclerosis	patients	taking	TYSABRI	_	and	concomitant	interferon_beta-1a	(	AVONEX	_	30	mcg	IM	once	weekly	)	or	glatiramer_acetate	were	inconclusive	with	regard	to	the	need	for	dose	adjustment	of	the	beta	-	interferon	or	glatiramer_acetate	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d73.s4	Methamphetamine	,	like	MPTP	,	produced	depletions	of	striatal	dopamine	but	these	actions	were	potentiated	by	pargyline	pretreatment	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d5.s0	Few	systemic	data	have	been	collected	on	the	metabolism	of	WELLBUTRIN	following	concomitant	administration	with	other	drugs	or	,	alternatively	,	the	effect	of	concomitant	administration	of	WELLBUTRIN	on	the	metabolism	of	other	drugs	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d313.s7	A	clinical	study	in	healthy	male	volunteers	(	n=24	)	demonstrated	that	mixing	NovoLog	with	NPH_human_insulin	immediately	before	injection	produced	some	attenuation	in	the	peak	concentration	of	NovoLog	,	but	that	the	time	to	peak	and	the	total	bioavailability	of	NovoLog	were	not	significantly	affected	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d99.s24	Discontinuation	of	cimetidine	in	well	-	controlled	patients	receiving	tricyclic_antidepressants	and	cimetidine	may	decrease	the	plasma	levels	and	efficacy	of	the	antidepressants	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d151.s1	Preliminary	animal	and	human	studies	have	shown	that	small	quantities	of	systemically	administered	leucovorin	enter	the	CSF	primarily	as	5-methyltetrahydro	-	folate	and	,	in	humans	,	remain	1	to	3	orders	of	magnitude	lower	than	the	usual	methotrexate	concentrations	following	intrathecal	administration	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d395.s17	Antacids	containing	aluminum_hydroxide	and	magnesium_hydroxide	reduce	the	oral	absorption	of	enoxacin	by	75	%	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d485.s23	Griseofulvin	,	Griseofulvin	may	induce	the	metabolism	of	combination_hormonal_contraceptives	causing	menstrual	changes	,	.
DDI-MedLine.d8.s1	The	antimicrobial	effect	of	a	benzoxazinorifamycin	,	KRM-1648	,	either	alone	or	in	combination	with	ofloxacin	,	was	evaluated	in	vitro	against	two	type	strains	and	six	clinical	isolates	of	Mycobacterium	ulcerans	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d423.s1	Because	dexfenfluramine	is	a	serotonin	releaser	and	reuptake	inhibitor	,	dexfenfluramine	should	not	be	used	concomitantly	with	a	MAO_inhibitor	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d76.s26	Theophylline	,	The	effect	of	steady	-	state	fluvoxamine	l50	mg	bid	on	the	pharmacokinetics	of	a	single	dose	of	Theophylline	(	375	mg	)	as	442	mg	aminophylline	was	evaluated	in	12	healthy	non	-	smoking	,	male	volunteers	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d61.s4	During	amiodarone	administration	,	systemic	clearance	of	digoxin	was	reduced	from	234	+	/-	72	ml	/	min	(	mean	+	/-	standard	deviation	)	to	172	+	/-	33	ml	/	min	(	p	less	than	0.01	)	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d399.s1	If	leprosy	-	associated	inflammatory	reactions	develop	in	patients	being	treated	with	dapsone	and	clofazimine	,	it	is	still	advisable	to	continue	treatment	with	both	drugs	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d76.s28	Therefore	,	if	theophylline	is	co	-	administered	with	fluvoxamine_maleate	,	its	dose	should	be	reduced	to	one	third	of	the	usual	daily	maintenance	dose	and	plasma	concentrations	of	theophylline	should	to	monitored	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d18.s1	The	effect	of	a	pulmonary_surfactant	extract	from	bovine	lung	,	Survanta	,	on	the	dissolution	rate	of	aerosol	particles	of	budesonide	was	determined	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d132.s4	Both	efavirenz	and	nevirapine	have	been	compared	to	triple	therapy	with	the	PI	indinavir	over	48	weeks	as	initial	therapy	,	with	similar	responses	being	observed	with	nevirapine	regimens	and	superiority	observed	with	efavirenz	.	.
