DDI-DrugBank.d106.s6	Propranolol	attenuated	the	heart	rate	increase	following	administration	of	immediate	release	nisoldipine	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d27.s2	However	,	in	clinical	studies	the	consequences	of	concomitant	irbesartan	on	the	pharmacodynamics	of	warfarin	were	negligible	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d272.s2	Compounds	in	these	categories	result	in	a	decreased	efficacy	of	bromocriptine_mesylate	,	phenothiazines	,	haloperidol	,	metoclopramide	,	pimozide	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d384.s15	Magnesium	,	Magnesium	-	containing	preparations	(	eg	,	antacids	)	may	cause	hypermagnesemia	and	should	therefore	not	be	taken	during	therapy	with	vitamin_D	by	patients	on	chronic	renal	dialysis	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d98.s8	Ketoconazole	,	Ketoconazole	may	inhibit	both	synthetic	and	catabolic	enzymes	of	vitamin_D.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d328.s43	Oral	Contraceptives	,	Valdecoxib	(	40	mg	BID	)	did	not	induce	the	metabolism	of	the	combination	oral	contraceptive	norethindrone	/	ethinyl_estradiol	(	1	mg	/35	mcg	combination	,	Ortho	-	Novum	1/35	)	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d1.s5	Sildenafil	is	contraindicated	in	patients	using	long	-	acting_nitrates	or	who	may	need	to	use	short	-	acting_nitrates	,	because	the	combination	may	cause	a	sharp	fall	of	the	blood	pressure	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d427.s1	There	have	been	reports	of	theophylline	-	related	side	effects	in	patients	on	concomitant	therapy	with	quinolones	and	theophylline	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d135.s4	PCP	produced	distinctive	effects	in	each	task	,	it	substituted	for	the	training	dose	in	PCP	discrimination	and	it	increased	the	number	of	responses	with	short	(	<3	s	)	interresponse	times	as	well	as	increasing	overall	response	rates	in	the	DRL	schedule	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d414.s2	EDECRIN	may	increase	the	ototoxic	potential	of	other	drugs	such	as	aminoglycoside	and	some	cephalosporin_antibiotics	.	.

DDI-DrugBank.d485.s19	Cyclosporine	,	Combination	hormonal_contraceptives	may	inhibit	the	metabolism	of	cyclosporine	,	leading	to	increased	plasma	concentrations	,	.
DDI-DrugBank.d328.s47	Diazepam	,	Diazepam	(	Valium	)	is	a	CYP	3A4	and	CYP	2C19	substrate	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d364.s5	Concomitant	administration	of	alosetron	and	moderate	CYP1A2	inhibitors	,	including	quinolone_antibiotics	and	cimetidine	,	has	not	been	evaluated	,	but	should	be	avoided	unless	clinically	necessary	because	of	similar	potential	drug	interactions	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d434.s26	Corresponding	values	for	free	valproate	Cmin	concentrations	were	7	3	,	9	4	,	and	11	6	micrograms	/	mL	for	0	,	1200	,	and	2400	mg	/	day	Felbatol	,	respectively	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d325.s13	Administration	of	phenytoin	to	patients	receiving	dopamine_HCl	has	been	reported	to	lead	to	hypotension	and	bradycardia	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d328.s14	Valdecoxib	did	not	have	a	statistically	significant	effect	on	the	pharmacokinetics	of	phenytoin	(	a	CYP	2C9	and	CYP	2C19	substrate	)	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d124.s23	Sedatives	/	Hypnotics	,	triazolam	,	midazolam	CONTRAINDICATED	due	to	potential	for	serious	and/or	life	-	threatening	reactions	such	as	prolonged	or	increased	sedation	or	respiratory	depression	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d82.s30	INDOCIN	and	potassium	-	sparing_diuretics	each	may	be	associated	with	increased	serum	potassium	levels	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d141.s2	CIMETlDINE	,	Cerivastatin	plasma	concentrations	were	not	affected	by	co	-	administration	of	cimetidine	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d503.s5	Consider	additive	sedative	effects	and	confusional	states	to	emerge	,	if	chlorprothixene	is	given	with	benzodiazepines	or	barbituates	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d212.s22	Probenecid	,	Probenecid	,	a	renal	tubular	secretion	blocking	agent	,	administered	at	a	dose	of	500	mg	four	times	a	day	,	did	not	change	the	pharmacokinetics	of	levetiracetam	1000	mg	twice	daily	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d195.s8	Co	-	administration	of	anastrozole	and	tamoxifen	resulted	in	a	reduction	of	anastrozole	plasma	levels	by	27	%	compared	with	those	achieved	with	anastrozole	alone	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d487.s2	Drugs	such	as	troleandomycin	and	ketoconazole	may	inhibit	the	metabolism	of	corticosteroids	and	thus	decrease	their	clearance	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d525.s3	Ranitidine	also	has	no	effect	on	eprosartan	pharmacokinetics	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d351.s0	Probenecid	,	As	with	other	b	-	lactam_antibiotics	,	renal	excretion	of	loracarbef	is	inhibited	by	probenecid	and	resulted	in	an	approximate	80	%	increase	in	the	AUC	for	loracarbef	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d94.s5	Thus	,	if	a	patient	has	been	titrated	to	a	stable	dosage	of	EQUETROTM	,	and	then	begins	a	course	of	treatment	with	one	of	these	CYP3A4	or	epoxide	hydrolase	inhibitors	,	it	is	reasonable	to	expect	that	a	dose	reduction	for	EQUETROTM	may	be	necessary	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d86.s8	CONCLUSIONS	,	Single	-	dose	diltiazem	coadministration	leads	to	higher	sirolimus	exposure	,	presumably	by	inhibition	of	the	first	-	pass	metabolism	of	sirolimus	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d236.s8	d	-	amphetamine	with	desipramine	or	protriptyline	and	possibly	other	tricyclics	cause	striking	and	sustained	increases	in	the	concentration	of	d	-	amphetamine	in	the	brain	,	.
DDI-DrugBank.d143.s7	In	view	of	the	long	and	variable	half	-	life	of	amiodarone	,	potential	for	drug	interactions	exists	not	only	with	concomitant	medication	but	also	with	drugs	administered	after	discontinuation	of	amiodarone	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d219.s22	Warfarin	,	The	effects	of	warfarin	and	NSAIDs	on	GI	bleeding	are	synergistic	,	such	that	users	of	both	drugs	together	have	a	risk	of	serious	GI	bleeding	higher	than	that	of	users	of	either	drug	alone	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d254.s0	Other	CNS_depressant_drugs	(	e.g.	barbiturates	,	tranquilizers	,	opioids	and	general	anesthetics	)	have	additive	or	potentiating	effects	with	INAPSINE	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d267.s5	Other	drugs	which	may	enhance	the	neuromuscular	blocking	action	of	nondepolarizing	agents	such	as	NUROMAX	include	certain	antibiotics	(	e.	g.	,	aminoglycosides	,	tetracyclines	,	bacitracin	,	polymyxins	,	lincomycin	,	clindamycin	,	colistin	,	and	sodium_colistimethate	)	,	magnesium	salts	,	lithium	,	local	anesthetics	,	procainamide	,	and	quinidine	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d438.s8	Carbamazepine	,	Steady	-	state	trough	plasma	carbamazepine	and	carbamazepine_10,_11_epoxide	concentrations	were	not	affected	by	concomitant	gabapentin	(	400	mg	TID	,	.
DDI-DrugBank.d284.s12	Beta	-	adrenergic_receptor_antagonists	(	beta	-	blockers	)	and	BROVANA	may	interfere	with	the	effect	of	each	other	when	administered	concurrently	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d45.s0	Concurrent	administration	of	etanercept	(	another	TNF	-blocking	agent	)	and	anakinra	(	an	interleukin-1_antagonist	)	has	been	associated	with	an	increased	risk	of	serious	infections	,	and	increased	risk	of	neutropenia	and	no	additional	benefit	compared	to	these	medicinal	products	alone	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d107.s1	The	possibility	of	hypotensive	effects	with	enalapril	or	enalaprilat	can	be	minimized	by	either	discontinuing	the	diuretic	or	increasing	the	salt	intake	prior	to	initiation	of	treatment	with	enalapril	or	enalaprilat	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d81.s6	Maximal	hypotension	was	found	120	minutes	post	ethanol	,	and	returned	to	normal	300	minutes	after	ethanol	.	.

DDI-DrugBank.d192.s0	Dexbrompheniramine	can	interact	with	alcohol	or	other	CNS_depressants	(	may	potentiate	the	CNS	depressant	effects	of	either	these	medications	or	antihistamines	)	,	anticholinergics	or	other	medications	with	anticholinergic	activity	(	anticholinergic	effects	may	be	potentiated	when	these	medications	are	used	concurrently	with	antihistamines	)	,	and	monoamine_oxidase_(MAO)_inhibitors	(	concurrent	use	with	antihistamines	may	prolong	and	intensify	the	anticholinergic	and	CNS	depressant	effects	of	antihistamines	)	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d499.s19	Probenecid	,	Probenecid	increases	both	free	and	bound	ketoprofen	by	reducing	the	plasma	clearance	of	ketoprofen	to	about	one	-	third	,	as	well	as	decreasing	its	protein	binding	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d395.s23	Warfarin	,	Quinolones	,	including	enoxacin	,	decrease	the	clearance	of	R	-	warfarin	,	the	less	active	isomer	of	racemic	warfarin	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d140.s6	Potential	differences	in	cyclosporine	dosing	and	pharmacokinetics	at	different	levels	of	everolimus	exposure	were	assessed	in	the	context	of	ANOVA	.	.

DDI-DrugBank.d263.s5	Zalcitabine	inhibited	lamivudine	phosphorylation	at	high	concentration	ratios	(	10	and	100	)	,	.
DDI-DrugBank.d438.s27	Morphine	pharmacokinetic	parameter	values	were	not	affected	by	administration	of	Neurontin	_	2	hours	after	morphine	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d105.s0	Anticoagulants	including	coumarin	derivatives	,	indandione	derivatives	,	and	platelet_aggregation_inhibitors	such	as	nonsteroidal_anti	-	inflammatory_drugs	(	NSAIDs	)	,	and	aspirin	may	increase	the	risk	of	bleeding	when	administered	concomitantly	with	ardeparin	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d567.s21	Digoxin	,	In	patients	with	hypercholesterolemia	,	concomitant	administration	of	lovastatin	and	digoxin	resulted	in	no	effect	on	digoxin	plasma	concentrations	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d2.s3	Neomycin	has	no	effect	on	the	blood	pressure	or	metabolic	responses	to	ACTH	in	sheep	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d548.s22	It	is	unknown	whether	the	concomitant	administration	of	proton_pump_inhibitors	affects	duloxetine	absorption	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d522.s23	Ergotamine	,	Concurrent	use	of	erythromycin	and	ergotamine	or	dihydroergotamine	has	been	associated	in	some	patients	with	acute	ergot	toxicity	characterized	by	severe	peripheral	vasospasm	and	dysesthesia	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d400.s12	Thus	,	when	NSAIDs	and	lithium	are	administered	concurrently	,	subjects	should	be	observed	carefully	for	signs	of	lithium	toxicity	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d29.s2	(	1968	,	1970	)	,	the	higher	serum	concentrations	of	penicillins	and	cephaloridine	reached	after	administration	of	probenecid	are	due	not	only	to	slower	renal	elimination	but	also	to	an	altered	distribution	in	the	body	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d410.s4	Nicotine	,	Nicotine	may	provoke	vasoconstriction	in	some	patients	,	predisposing	to	a	greater	ischemic	response	to	ergot	therapy	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d484.s0	Etonogestrel	may	interact	with	the	following	medications	,	acetaminophen	(	Tylenol	)	,	antibiotics	such	as	ampicillin	and	tetracycline	,	anticonvulsants	(	Dilantin	,	Phenobarbital	,	Tegretol	,	Trileptal	,	Topamax	,	Felbatol	)	,	antifungals	(	Gris	-	PEG	,	Nizoral	,	Sporanox	)	,	atorvastatin	(	Lipitor	)	,	clofibrate	(	Atromid	-	S	)	,	cyclosporine	(	Neoral	,	Sandimmune	)	,	HIV	drugs	classified	as	protease	inhibitors	(	Agenerase	,	Crixivan	,	Fortovase	,	Invirase	,	Kaletra	,	Norvir	,	Viracept	)	,	morphine	(	Astramorph	,	Kadian	,	MS	Contin	)	,	phenylbutazone	,	prednisolone	(	Prelone	)	,	rifadin	(	rifampin	)	,	St.	Johns	wort	,	temazepam	,	theophylline	(	Theo	-	Dur	)	,	and	vitamin	C.	.
DDI-MedLine.d3.s13	Rifampin	markedly	increases	the	metabolic	clearance	of	amprenavir	,	and	coadministration	is	contraindicated	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d357.s3	Dopamine_Antagonists	,	Since	apomorphine	is	a	dopamine_agonist	,	it	is	possible	that	dopamine_antagonists	,	such	as	the	neuroleptics	(	phenothiazines	,	butyrophenones	,	thioxanthenes	)	or	metoclopramide	,	may	diminish	the	effectiveness	of	APOKYN	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d175.s1	The	possibility	of	hypotensive	effects	with	captopril	can	be	minimized	by	either	discontinuing	the	diuretic	or	increasing	the	salt	intake	approximately	one	week	prior	to	initiation	of	treatment	with	captopril	(	captopril	tablets	,	USP	)	or	initiating	therapy	with	small	doses	(	6.25	or	12.5	mg	)	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d518.s0	Prolonged	recovery	time	may	occur	if	barbiturates	and/or	narcotics	are	used	concurrently	with	ketamine	.	.

DDI-DrugBank.d172.s20	Patients	on	lithium	treatment	should	be	closely	monitored	when	CELEBREX	is	introduced	or	withdrawn	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d456.s1	Caution	should	be	used	when	administering	or	taking	TARCEVA	with	ketoconazole	and	other	strong	CYP3A4	inhibitors	such	as	,	but	not	limited	to	,	atazanavir	,	clarithromycin	,	indinavir	,	itraconazole	,	nefazodone	,	nelfinavir	,	ritonavir	,	saquinavir	,	telithromycin	,	troleandomycin	(	TAO	)	,	and	voriconazole	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d561.s3	Potassium	Supplements	and	Potassium	-	Sparing_Diuretics	Lotensin	can	attenuate	potassium	loss	caused	by	thiazide_diuretics	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d246.s8	The	safety	of	using	STADOL_NS	and	IMITREX	(	sumatriptan	)	Nasal	Spray	during	the	same	episode	of	migraine	has	not	been	established	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d438.s10	Likewise	,	gabapentin	pharmacokinetics	were	unaltered	by	carbamazepine	administration	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d175.s10	Agents	Affecting	Sympathetic	Activity	The	sympathetic	nervous	system	may	be	especially	important	in	supporting	blood	pressure	in	patients	receiving	captopril	alone	or	with	diuretics	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d364.s0	Because	alosetron	is	metabolized	by	a	variety	of	hepatic	CYP	drug	-	metabolizing	enzymes	,	inducers	or	inhibitors	of	these	enzymes	may	change	the	clearance	of	alosetron	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d99.s9	The	extent	to	which	SSRI	-	TCA	interactions	may	pose	clinical	problems	will	depend	on	the	degree	of	inhibition	and	the	pharmacokinetics	of	the	SSRI	involved	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d88.s6	Deaths	from	severe	enterocolitis	,	diarrhea	,	and	dehydration	have	been	reported	in	elderly	patients	receiving	weekly	leucovorin	and	fluorouracil	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d475.s3	In	patients	given	very	high	doses	(	3900	mg	)	of	aspirin	daily	,	increases	in	serum	salicylate	levels	were	seen	when	nizatidine	,	150	mg	b.i.d	.	,	was	administered	concurrently	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d72.s2	Phenytoin	increases	the	clearance	of	busulfan	by	15	%	or	more	,	possibly	due	to	the	induction	of	glutathione	-	S	-	transferase	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d94.s9	Agents	with	Decreased	Levels	in	the	Presence	of	Carbamazepine	due	to	Induction	of	Cytochrome	P450	Enzymes	Carbamazepine	is	known	to	induce	CYP1A2	and	CYP3A4	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d458.s8	Data	suggest	that	coadministration	of	oral	ketoconazole	and	cisapride	can	result	in	prolongation	of	the	QT	interval	on	the	ECG	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d175.s8	Agents	Causing	Renin	Release	Captopril	's	effect	will	be	augmented	by	antihypertensive_agents	that	cause	renin	release	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d373.s8	Quinidine	,	Immediate	Release	Capsules	,	There	have	been	rare	reports	of	an	interaction	between	quinidine	and	nifedipine	(	with	a	decreased	plasma	level	of	quinidine	)	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d165.s10	therefore	concomitant	administration	of	Itraconazole	with	cisapride	is	contraindicated	.	.
DDI-MedLine.d12.s5	Dexamethasone	had	a	similar	effect	in	the	presence	of	insulin	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d186.s4	In	a	study	of	12	schizophrenic	patients	coadministered	oral	haloperidol	and	rifampin	,	plasma	haloperidol	levels	were	decreased	by	a	mean	of	70	%	and	mean	scores	on	the	Brief	Psychiatric	Rating	Scale	were	increased	from	baseline	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d35.s0	Interactions	may	occur	between	EPA	supplements	and	aspirin	and	other	non	-	steroidal_anti	-	inflammatory_drugs	and	herbs	such	as	garlic	(	Allium	sativum	)	and	ginkgo	(	Ginkgo_biloba	)	.	.
DDI-DrugBank.d276.s3	The	resulting	increase	in	nitrofurantoin	serum	levels	may	increase	toxicity	,	and	the	decreased	urinary	levels	could	lessen	its	efficacy	as	a	urinary	tract	antibacterial	.	.
