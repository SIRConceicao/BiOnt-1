s77	Thus	,	our	data	indicate	that	protein_polyubiquitination-132	induces	temozolomide	resistance	and	promotes	the	formation	of	cancer_stem	cell	phenotypes	by	targeting	TUSC3	in	glioblastoma	.
s182	In	conclusion	,	overexpression	of	the	striated_muscle_contraction	-	p	.	N49S	mutation	in	a	mouse	heart	can	be	responsible	for	the	phenotype	of	deep	trabeculation	,	dilated	cardiomyopathy	,	and	cardiac	dysfunction	,	which	resembles	the	phenotype	of	LVNC	.
s130	By	targeting	peptidyl	-	tyrosine_phosphorylation	,	WRG-28	inhibits	tumor_invasion	and	migration	,	as	well	as	tumor	-	supporting	roles	of	the	stroma	,	and	inhibits	metastatic	breast	tumor	cell	colonization	in	the	lungs	.	.
s7	Taken	together	,	we	firstly	revealed	that	quercetin	suppressed	the	progression	of	breast	cancer_by	inhibiting	cell	mobility	and	glycolysis	through	Akt	-	regulation_of_cell_growth_pathway	mediated	autophagy	induction	and	may	provide	a	potential	therapeutic	target	for	breast	cancer	treatment	.
s34	glycoprotein_catabolic_process_patients	produce	little	or	no	N	-	glycanase	(	Ngly1	)	,	and	the	symptoms	include	global	developmental	delay	,	frequent	seizures	,	complex	hyperkinetic	movement	disorder	,	difficulty	in	swallowing	/	aspiration	,	liver_dysfunction	,	and	a	lack	of	tears	.	.
s0	In	addition	,	the	coexistence	of	high	MACC1	and	low	positive_regulation_of_DNA_binding	-	H1	expression	and	tumor_budding	was	associated	with	short	OS	(	p	AAAA	0.001	)	.	.
s102	Genes	with	DMRs	were	involved	in	inflammatory	response	(	IRAK4	and	ESM1	)	,	cancer_(BRCA1	and	LASP1	)	,	endocrine	function	(	CNPY1	)	,	and	male	fertility	(	skeletal_system_morphogenesis	,	TESC	,	and	PRDM8	)	.	.
s148	Importantly	,	bone	cell	activity	was	inversely	correlated	to	tumor_cell	AR	activity	(	measured	as	AR	,	FOXA1	,	HOXB13	,	KLK2	,	plasminogen_activation	,	NKX3	-	1	,	STEAP2	,	and	TMPRSS2	expression	)	and	to	patient	serum	prostate	-	specific	antigen	(	PSA	)	levels	.	.
s151	Conclusions	,	The	expression	of	skeletal_system_development	-	AS	is	upregulated	in	esophageal	cancer_cell	lines	and	tissues	.	.
s176	Single	nucleotide	polymorphism	in	infant	genes	in	the	folate	(	tetrahydrofolate_metabolic_process_rs12438477	)	,	homocysteine	(	TRDMT1	rs6602178	and	GNMT	rs11752813	)	and	transsulfuration	(	GSTP1	rs7941395	and	MGST1	rs7294985	)	pathways	were	also	associated	with	an	increased	risk	of	congenital_heart_defects	.	Conclusions	Common	maternal	or	infant	genetic	variants	in	folate	,	homocysteine	,	or	transsulfuration	pathways	are	associated	with	an	increased	risk	of	certain	congenital	heart	defects	among	children	of	women	taking	SSRIs	during	cardiogenesis	.
s72	Altogether	these	data	demonstrate	that	mutations	in	negative_regulation_of_protein_kinase_activity_cause	a	congenital	muscular_dystrophy_syndrome	with	short	stature	,	cataracts	,	and	intellectual	disability	.
s167	Some	of	them	were	cancer	-	related	according	to	COSMIC	and	HGMD	databases	(	no	founder	mutations	in	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination_and	BRCA2	have	been	found	)	.	.
s60	We	report	here	two	new	nonsense	mutations	(	pGln12	_	and	pTyr110	)	in	positive_regulation_of_cytosolic_calcium_ion_concentration_patients	displaying	nonsyndromic	profound	hearing_loss	,	with	no	evidence	of	vestibular	or	retinal	dysfunction	.	.
s24	Variants	of	WNK1	(	lysine	deficient	protein	kinase	1	)	,	ADRB2	(	b2	adrenergic	receptor	)	,	NEDD4L	(	ubiquitin	-	protein	ligase	ubiquitin	-	dependent_protein_catabolic_process	-	like	)	,	KLK1	(	kallikrein	1	)	contribute	to	hypertension	,	and	AKR1C3	(	aldo	-	keto	reductase	family1	member	C3	)	,	is	associated	with	preeclampsia	.	.
s101	In	particular	,	MYH9	mutations	result	in	congenital	macrothrombocytopenia	and	predispose	to	kidney	failure	,	hearing_loss	,	and	cataracts	,	MPL	and	MECOM	mutations	cause	congenital	thrombocytopenia	evolving	into	bone	marrow	failure	,	whereas	thrombocytopenias	caused	by	RUNX1	,	negative_regulation_of_fat_cell_differentiation	,	and	ETV6	mutations	are	characterized	by	predisposition	to	hematological	malignancies	.	.
s32	In	humans	,	sensory_perception_of_sound_mutations	cause	autosomal_recessive_nonsyndromic	deafness	(	DFNB79	)	by	an	unknown	mechanism	.	.
s160	We	detected	11	novel	mutations	in	GJA3	,	GJA8	,	CRYAA	,	CRYBB2	,	morphogenesis_of_an_epithelium	,	CRYGA	,	GCNT2	,	CRYGA	,	and	MIP	,	and	three	previously	reported	cataract	-	causing	mutations	in	GJA8	,	CRYAA	,	and	CRYBB2	The	most	commonly	mutated	genes	were	those	coding	for	gap	junctions	and	crystallin	proteins	.	.
s196	positive_regulation_of_antigen_processing_and_presentation_of_peptide_antigen_via_MHC_class_II_protein	levels	were	also	negatively	correlated	with	the	severity	of	symptoms	in	humans	affected	by	autism	.	.
s43	This	is	prototypically	exemplified	by	neuroblastoma	,	where	positive_regulation_of_gene_expression_amplification	occurs	in	about	25	%	of	the	cases	.	.
s39	In	families	severely	affected	with	breast	cancer	,	we	identified	inherited	negative_regulation_of_protein_export_from_nucleus_missense	mutations	Cys53Trp	,	Cys71Tyr	,	and	Cys83Arg	that	alter	three	zinc	-	binding	residues	of	the	BARD1	RING	domain	.	.
s40	We	hope	that	our	study	will	stimulate	further	studies	and	a	new	targeted	therapy	and	early	medical	intervention	for	YAP	/	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_could	be	a	useful	option	for	breast	cancer_cases	complicated	with	LKB1	deficiency	.
s138	MED1	mediates	induction	of	cell	proliferation	and	migration	and	the	genes	associated	with	it	(	JUN	,	FOS	,	EGFR	,	VEGF	,	proteolysis	,	and	ERBB4	)	in	breast	cancer	,	which	is	abrogated	when	used	together	with	miR-191-inhibition	.	.
s111	We	expand	the	knowledge	about	protein_localization_to_plasma_membrane_deficiency	,	describing	a	patient	with	the	mild	phenotype	of	TTC7A	deficiency	but	presenting	overlapping	features	of	SD	/	THE	and	MIA	-	CID	,	intestinal	atresia	and	inflammatory	bowel	disease	evocative	of	MIA	-	CID	,	but	also	dental_abnormalities	,	huge	forehead	,	liver	abnormalities	,	autoimmune	thyroiditis	and	hypogammaglobulinemia	,	evocative	of	SD	/	THE	.
s61	This	was	accompanied	by	neuronal_loss_and	neuro	-	axonal	dysfunction	in	adult	OL	-	potassium_ion_import_across_plasma_membrane_cKO	mice	as	shown	by	delayed	visual	evoked	potentials	,	inner	retinal	thinning	and	progressive	motor	deficits	.	.
s52	In	tumors	with	high	PIK3R2	expression	,	and	independently	of	PIK3CA	,	KRAS	,	or	negative_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_mutations	,	PIK3R2	depletion	induced	lung	SQCC	xenograft	regression	without	triggering	PI3K	/	AKT	pathway	rebound	.	.
s104	Bardet	-	Biedl	syndrome	(	visual_perception	)	is	a	genetically	heterogeneous_disorder	characterized	by	retinal	dystrophy	,	polydactyly	,	obesity	,	developmental	delay	,	and	renal	defects	.	.
s212	Our	findings	indicate	that	BM	-	derived	transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_IIs	from	patients	with	newly	diagnosed	AML	display	phenotypic	and	functional	alterations	such	as	proliferative	deficiency	that	could	be	attributed	to	tumor_progression	,	but	does	not	seem	to	play	a	special	role	in	the	leukemic	process	.
s172	Six	novel	visual_perception_mutations	(	p	.	Asp65ThrfsX38	,	p	.	Arg142GlyfsX5	,	p	.	Arg142AlafsX22	,	p	.	Tyr144X	,	p	.	Arg169X	,	and	p	.	Tyr46Asp	)	were	identified	in	other	six	families	with	congenital	nuclear	cataracts	,	respectively	.	.
s51	One	of	the	mechanisms	of	the	growth	inhibitory	effect	is	probably	that	sphingosine-1-phosphate_receptor_signaling_pathway_inhibition	lower	the	phosphorylation	level	of	extracellular	regulated	protein	kinase	1/2	(	ERK1/2	)	pathway	,	which	prevent	the	transformation	of	ovarian	cancer_cells	from	phase	G(1	)	to	S	.
s96	Tricho	-	hepato	-	enteric	syndrome	(	negative_regulation_of_protein_export_from_nucleus	/	THE	)	and	Multiple	intestinal_atresia_with	combined	immune	deficiency	(	MIA	-	CID	)	are	autosomal	recessive	disorders	that	present	immunological	and	gastrointestinal	features	.	.
s124	We	also	emphasized	that	the	angiogenesis_and	AKT	signaling	pathways	were	the	mechanisms	underlying	the	inhibitory	effect	of	HCRP1	on	glioma_cells	.	.
s63	Our	analyses	revealed	that	the	primary	tumor_and	NCC	-	SS1-C1	cell	line	harbored	the	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	-	SSX1	fusion	gene	typical	of	synovial	sarcoma	and	similar	proteomics	profiles	.	.
s64	Previous	studies	have	identified	a	critical	role	for	the	tumor_suppressors	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination_and	BRCA2	in	preventing	the	degradation	of	nascent	DNA	by	the	MRE11	nuclease	after	replication	stress	.	.
s133	Immunohistochemistry	demonstrated	that	the	loss	of	peptidyl	-	threonine_phosphorylation_expression	,	which	was	observed	in	50.8	%	of	primary	gastric	cancer_tissues	(	n=128	)	,	significantly	correlated	with	advanced	tumor	stage	(	PAAAA0.001	)	,	frequent	lymph	node	metastasis	(	PAAAA0.001	)	,	distant	metastasis	(	P=0.013	)	,	tumor	differentiation	(	P=0.004	)	and	unfavorable	overall	survival	(	PAAAA0.001	)	.	.
s210	We	identified	a	homozygous	missense	mutation	,	c.1308	G	-	A	(	p	.	V421	M	)	in	mitochondrial_respiratory_chain_complex_I_assembly_in	a	patient	who	presented	with	epilepsy	and	severe_psychomotor	retardation	.	.
s16	From	a	GeneMatcher	-	enabled	international	collaboration	,	we	identified	ten	individuals	affected	by	intellectual	disability	,	speech	delay	,	ataxia	,	and	facial	dysmorphism	and	carrying	a	deleterious	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_variant	detected	by	whole	-	exome	sequencing	.	.
s21	Here	we	report	three	families	with	homozygous	truncating	mutations	in	vesicle_tethering_to_Golgi_who	display	moderate	to	severe	intellectual	disability	and	microcephaly	.	.
s105	We	characterize	variants	in	the	oxidoreductase	cellular_response_to_oxidative_stress_as	a	cause	of	early	-	onset	myopathy_with	distinctive	histopathology	and	introduce	altered	redox	regulation	as	a	primary	cause	of	congenital	muscle	disease	.
s57	However	,	certain	chromatin	remodeling	genes	(	MLL1	,	MLL2	,	MLL3	,	BAP1	,	PBRM1	,	EED	,	and	ATRX	)	were	found	to	be	mutated	in	7/22	(	32	%	)	of	intraductal	tubulopapillary	neoplasms	and	27	%	harbored	phosphatidylinositol	3-kinase	(	PI3	K	)	pathway	(	phosphorylation	,	PIK3CB	,	INPP4A	,	and	PTEN	)	mutations	.	.
s126	We	summarize	the	phenotypic	extent	of	smoothened_signaling_pathway/3	syndromes	in	the	literature	and	determine	that	these	2	syndromes	manifest	opposite	features	to	a	certain	extent	,	such	as	midface_hypoplasia_or	macrocephaly	,	and	anterior	or	posterior	side	of	polydactyly	.	.
s10	Meanwhile	,	mismatch_repair_rs175057	CAAAAT	locus	was	also	associated	with	longer	overall	survival	time	in	locally	advanced	rectal	cancer_(HR=0.44	,	95	%	CI	,	0.20	-	0.96	,	P=0.038	)	,	whereas	MSH2	rs3771273	TAAAAA	,	rs10188090	AAAAAG	and	rs10191478	TAAAAG	loci	were	associated	with	shorter	overall	survival	time	(	HR=1.74	,	95	%	CI	,	1.06	-	2.84	,	P=0.028	,	HR=1.64	,	95	%	CI	,	1.01	-	2.66	,	P=0.046	,	HR=1.71	,	95	%	CI	,	1.01	-	2.91	,	P=0.047	,	respectively	)	.	.
s191	Ectopic	expression	of	protein_polyubiquitination-451a	significantly	inhibited	cancer_cell	migration	and	invasion	by	RCC	cell	lines	,	suggesting	that	miR-451a	had	antitumor	roles	.	.
s19	RT	-	PCR	analysis	showed	that	the	overall	transcriptional	activity	of	the	main	HS	biosynthesis	-	involved	genes	(	EXT1	,	EXT2	,	NDST1	,	NDST2	,	GLCE	,	HS2ST1	,	HS3ST1	,	HS3ST2	,	HS6ST1	,	HS6ST2	,	SULF1	,	positive_regulation_of_Wnt_signaling_pathway	,	HPSE	)	was	decreased	by	1.5	-	2-fold	in	Grade	II	-	III	glioma	(	p	AAAA	0.01	)	and	by	3-fold	in	Grade	IV	glioma	(	glioblastoma	multiforme	,	GBM	)	(	p	AAAA	0.05	)	,	as	compared	with	the	para	-	tumourous	tissue	.	.
s110	To	gain	insight	into	the	molecular	basis	of	the	heterogeneous_phenotype	observed	in	men	with	the	deletion	we	defined	the	type	of	DAZ	and	spermatogenesis_genes	deleted	.	.
s120	Missense	mutations	that	disrupt	the	RING	domain	of	the	tumor_suppressor	gene	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination_lead	to	increased	risk	of	breast	and	ovarian	cancer	.	.
s89	Encapsulation	of	mirin	in	nanoparticles	allowed	its	use	on	MYCN	-	amplified	neuroblastoma_xenografts	in	vivo	,	which	resulted	in	a	sharp	impairment	of	tumor	growth	,	associated	with	DDR	activation	,	DNA_strand_renaturation_accumulation	,	and	cell	death	.	.
s85	Mutations	in	antibacterial_humoral_response_(PARK14	)	cause	neurodegenerative	disorders	in	humans	,	including	autosomal_recessive_neuroaxonal	dystrophy	and	early	-	onset	parkinsonism	.	.
s58	We	report	brothers	with	optic	neuropathy_who	had	novel	mutations	in	the	regulation_of_dendrite_development_gene	.	.
s67	Altogether	,	these	data	point	to	a	pathophysiological	mechanism	responsible	for	RGC	early	degeneration	and	optic	neuropathy_and	linking	regulation_of_dendrite_development_functions	to	mitochondrial	physiology	,	response	to	UV	light	,	and	dendrite	growth	during	eye	maturation	.
s98	Pain	scores	correlated	with	total	body	tumor_volume	(	rho	=	0.32471	,	P	=	.0499	)	,	but	not	with	number	of	tumors	(	rho	=	0.23065	,	P	=	.1696).We	found	no	significant	difference	in	quantitative	tumor	burden	between	mutational	groups	,	but	spinal	schwannomas	were	more	common	in	anatomical_structure_morphogenesis	-	mutant	patients	.	.
s195	We	investigated	plasma	microRNA	(	protein_polyubiquitinationNA	)	profiles	associated	with	variation	of	hyperglycemia	,	measured	as	hemoglobin	A1c	(	HbA1c	)	,	in	two	panels	of	patients	with	type	1	diabetes	(	T1D	)	.	.
s192	Further	in	silico	functional	analyses	revealed	that	rs2394882	affects	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_expression	,	which	in	turn	is	significantly	correlated	with	prostate	cancer	aggressiveness_and	patient	prognosis	.	.
s42	On	the	other	hand	,	MYH1	,	MYH2	,	MYH3	,	MYH7	,	MYH8	,	FOXO3	,	NFATC1	,	PTGS2	,	KAT6B	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	and	RUNX2	expression	is	suspected	to	be	involved	in	the	epigenetic	regulations	behind	the	mandibular	prognathism_phenotype	.
s71	Conclusions	,	The	growth	of	ovarian	cancer_cells	could	be	decreased	by	sphingosine-1-phosphate_receptor_signaling_pathway_inhibition	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	.	.
s162	Collagen	type	4	alpha	1	(	COL4A1	)	and	collagen	type	13	alpha	1	(	cell	-	matrix_adhesion	)	produced	by	urothelial	cancer_cells	support	the	vital	oncogenic	property	of	tumor	invasion	.	.
s202	The	most	frequent	hearing_loss_associated	allele	detected	in	this	population	was	the	235delC	variant	in	gap_junction_assembly_gene	.	.
s216	However	,	the	global	effects	of	transcription,_DNA	-	templated_expression	in	various	tissues	affected	by	cancer_remain	unknown	.	.
s143	This	work	associates	missense	mutations	in	positive_regulation_of_protein_ubiquitination_with	an	autosomal_recessive_chromosome	breakage	syndrome	that	leads	to	defective	T	and	B	cell	function	and	acute	respiratory	distress	syndrome	in	early	childhood	.
s4	p16	is	an	important	tumor_suppressor	gene	encoded	by	the	G1/S_transition_of_mitotic_cell_cycle	/	ARF	/	INK4B	gene	locus	that	is	conserved	in	humans	,	rodents	,	and	canids	.	.
s198	Here	,	we	are	elucidating	the	mechanism	of	a	heritable	positive_regulation_of_telomere_maintenance_via_telomerase_subunit	mutation	that	causes	profound_neuropathy	in	humans	.	.
s145	In	this	study	,	we	investigated	the	presence	and	functionality	of	defense_response_to_bacteriumR	,	as	well	as	the	implications	of	Epo	upon	the	proliferation	and	survival	of	lung	cancer_cells	.	.
s189	Constitutive	activation	of	interferon	signaling	pathways	has	been	reported	in	colorectal	cancer_(CRC	)	,	leading	to	a	strong	CD8	+	T	cell	response	through	stimulation	of	negative_regulation_of_NF	-	kappaB_transcription_factor_activity_expression	.	.
s1	DHEA	prevents	mitochondrial_dysfunction_by	decreasing	the	activation	of	DNM1L	and	MFF	,	and	increasing	mitochondrial_fusion_expression	.	.
s117	Methods	We	identified	all	materials	published	mentioning	both	protein_neddylation_and	allergic	rhinitis	(	AR	)	,	chronic	sinusitis	,	asthma	,	and	atopic_dermatitis_(AD	)	that	are	indexed	on	PubMed	,	Google	,	or	the	ProQuest	Central	databases	.	.
s27	In	particular	,	angiogenesis_mutations	result	in	congenital	macrothrombocytopenia	and	predispose	to	kidney	failure	,	hearing_loss	,	and	cataracts	,	MPL	and	MECOM	mutations	cause	congenital	thrombocytopenia	evolving	into	bone	marrow	failure	,	whereas	thrombocytopenias	caused	by	RUNX1	,	ANKRD26	,	and	ETV6	mutations	are	characterized	by	predisposition	to	hematological	malignancies	.	.
s79	Protein	kinase	A	(	PKA	)	signaling	pathway	including	AKAP12	,	RDX	,	and	protein_kinase_A_signaling_genes	were	identified	as	potential	mechanisms	for	the	activity	of	garlic	extract	in	cancer_prevention	.	.
s129	Loss	-	of	-	function	mutations	in	protein_dephosphorylation_cause	the	severe	congenital	myopathy	called	myotubular	myopathy	(	or	X	-	linked	centronuclear	myopathy	)	while	mutations	in	the	MTM1-related	protein	MTMR2	cause	a	recessive	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	peripheral_neuropathy	.	.
s134	In	this	report	we	describe	a	female	child	with	global	developmental	delay	,	microcephaly	and	myoclonic	seizures_harbouring	a	5	Mb	deletion	in	14q12	locus	resulting	in	deletion	of	single	copy	of	brain	specific	genes	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	,	PRKD1	and	NOVA1	.	.
s70	Our	study	identified	a	novel	protein	downstream	of	Ras	and	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	,	which	may	serve	as	a	potential	therapeutic	drug	target	for	lung	cancer_patients	.
s59	This	validation	revealed	that	the	expression	of	eye_developmentAAAAAmdash	,	but	not	SPRY1AAAAAmdash	,	is	higher	in	glioblastoma_cell	lines	when	compared	to	non	-	malignant	astrocytes	.	.
s20	We	present	two	families	with	stress	-	activated_protein_kinase_signaling_cascade	-	related	recessive	congenital	hydrocephalus_with	children	who	had	severe	hydrocephalus	.	.
s161	Patients	with	adult	-	onset	angiogenesis_may	present	with	slowly	progressive	ataxia	,	persistent	photosensitivity	,	and	seizures	without	dementia	or	extrapyramidal	findings	.	.
s164	MDR	rectal	colonization	occurs	in	6.5	%	of	haematological	inpatients	and	predicts	a	16	%	probability	of	MDRrel	BSI	,	particularly	during	neutropenia	,	as	well	as	a	higher	probability	of	unfavourable	outcomes	in	positive_regulation_of_cytosolic_calcium_ion_concentration	-	rel	BSIs	.	.
s106	We	found	no	correlation	between	the	DLEC1	,	TUSC4	and	mismatch_repair_gene	expression	and	NSCLC	patient	characteristics	(	gender	,	age	and	smoking	)	or	cancer_histopathology	.	.
s46	3	)	Multiple	endocrine	neoplasia_type	1	(	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	)	is	most	frequently	expressed	as	PHPT	with	asymmetric	enlargement	of	3	-	4	parathyroids	.	.
s168	Our	findings	indicate	that	mutations	in	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_cause	a	genetic	neurodevelopmental	syndrome	and	suggest	that	loss	of	EBF3	function	might	mediate	a	subset	of	neurologic	phenotypes	shared	by	ARX	-	related	disorders	,	including	intellectual_disability	,	abnormal	genitalia	,	and	structural	CNS	malformations	.
s38	Microfibrillar	-	associated	protein	5	(	definitive_hemopoiesis	)	is	a	component	of	extracellular	elastic	microfibril	which	has	been	confirmed	to	function	in	tissue	development	and	cancer_progression	.	.
s127	In	the	present	study	,	pyridoxal_phosphate_biosynthetic_process_expression	in	human	ovarian	tumour_tissue	and	its	association	with	the	clinicopathological	features	of	patients	with	EOC	were	examined	.	.
s166	These	findings	establish	these	mutant	mice	as	a	suitable	model	system	to	elucidate	how	negative_regulation_of_endopeptidase_activity_deficiency	causes	deafness_in	humans	.
s149	Germline	mutations	in	KCNJ5	and	regulation_of_membrane_potential_cause	FH	-	III	and	FH	-	IV	,	respectively	,	while	germline	mutations	in	CACNA1D	cause	the	rare	PASNA	syndrome	,	featuring	primary	aldosteronism	seizures_and	neurological	abnormalities	.	.
s155	Up	to	half	of	patients	with	PC	/	tricarboxylic_acid_cycle_and	renal	neoplasia_had	VHL	syndrome	,	SDH	deficiency	,	or	alterations	in	TMEM127	.	.
s93	Additionally	,	protein_polyubiquitination-577	may	act	as	a	valuable	tumor_marker	to	predict	the	prognosis	of	HCC	patients	.	.
s125	Idiopathic	pulmonary	fibrosis	(	IPF	)	is	a	complex	,	heterogeneous_genetic	disorder	that	is	associated	with	rare	and	common	sequence	variants	in	many	genes	(	MUC5B	,	SFTPC	,	developmental_process	,	RTEL1	,	TERT	,	and	hTR	)	,	11	novel	loci	,	and	multiple	emerging	epigenetic	and	transcriptional	profiles	.	.
s136	Cystinuria	is	a	heterogeneous	,	rare	but	important	cause	of	inherited	kidney	stone	disease	due	to	mutations	in	2	genes	,	SLC3A1	and	neutral_amino_acid_transport	.	.
s48	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	negative_regulation_of_I	-	kappaB_kinase	/	NF	-	kappaB_signaling	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s159	In	the	present	study	,	the	results	obtained	from	our	previously	published	methylation	array	were	analyzed	and	10	candidate	genes	involved	in	DNA	repair	[	protein	phosphatase	4	catalytic	subunit	(	PPP4C	)	]	,	apoptosis	[	runt	related	transcription	factor	3	(	protein_phosphorylation	)	,	interferon	regulatory	factor	4	(	IRF4	)	,	ubiquitin	C	-	terminal	hydrolase	L1	(	UCHL1	)	and	tumor_protein	p53	inducible	protein	3	(	TP53I3	)	]	,	cell	proliferation	[	cyclin	D2	(	CCND2	)	and	Ras	association	domain	family	member	1	(	RASSF1	)	]	,	drug	metabolism	[	aldehyde	dehydrogenase	1	family	member	A3	(	ALDH1A3	)	and	solute	carrier	family	29	member	1	(	SLC29A1	)	]	and	angiogenesis	[	human	immunodeficiency	virus-1	tat	interactive	protein	2	(	HTATIP2	)	]	were	selected	for	quantification	of	their	methylation	levels	in	54	CCA	and	19	adjacent	normal	tissues	using	methylation	-	sensitive	high	-	resolution	melting	.	.
s44	Elevated	keratin-8	(	keratinization	)	protein	expression	is	an	established	diagnostic	cancer_biomarker	in	several	epithelial	cancers	(	but	not	ATC	)	.	.
s209	While	these	expansions	occur	in	coding	and	noncoding	regions	,	microsatellite	sequence	and	repeat	length	diversity	is	more	prominent	in	introns	with	eight	different	trinucleotide	to	hexanucleotide	repeats	,	causing	hereditary	diseases	such	as	myotonic	dystrophy	type	2	(	DM2	)	,	Fuchs	endothelial	corneal_dystrophy_(FECD	)	,	and	C9orf72	amyotrophic	lateral	sclerosis	and	frontotemporal	dementia	(	cell_killing	-	ALS	/	FTD	)	.	.
s177	Interventions	on	cytoskeletal_anchoring_at_plasma_membrane	-	related	diseases	require	prenatal	surveillance	by	sonography	,	gene	testing	in	high	-	risk	carriers	,	and	proper	orthosis	or	orthopedic	surgeries	to	correct	malformations	including	scoliosis	,	cervical	spine	instability	,	large	joint	dislocation	,	and	clubfoot	.	.
s215	In	lung_adenocarcinoma_(LADC	)	,	specific	thyroxin	kinase	inhibitors	against	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_mutations	and	ALK	fusions	are	used	as	a	standard	treatment	regimen	and	show	significant	positive	efficacy	.	.
s36	Moreover	,	in	patients	with	low	negative_regulation_of_translation_expression	,	two	oxidative	metabolic	indicators	,	pyruvate	dehydrogenase	B	expression	and	the	ratio	of	lactate	dehydrogenase	type	B	to	type	A	,	significantly	and	negatively	correlated	with	CLN1	expression	,	indicating	that	the	combination	of	elevated	glycolysis	and	deficient	MRPL13	activity	was	closely	linked	to	CLN1-mediated	tumor_activity	in	LIHC	.	.
s78	However	,	there	is	much	debate	over	the	roles	of	the	reversionless	3-like	(	REV3L	)	protein	responsible	for	TLS	and	DNA_strand_renaturation_in	regulating	cancer_cell	metabolism	.	.
s158	This	case	suggested	a	broad	phenotypic	spectrum	arises	from	corpus_callosum_morphogenesis_mutations	,	forming	a	continuum	from	epileptic	encephalopathy_and	severe	developmental	delay	to	mild	intellectual	disability	without	epilepsy	.	.
s123	Smith	-	Magenis	syndrome	(	SMS	)	,	a	neurodevelopmental	disorder	characterized	by	dysmorphic	features	,	intellectual_disability_(ID	)	,	and	sleep	disturbances	,	results	from	a	17p11.2	microdeletion	or	a	mutation	in	the	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_gene	.	.
s92	positive_regulation_of_vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_production_expression	appeared	to	be	decreased	in	lung	tumor_tissue	and	further	downregulated	in	samples	from	patients	with	LNM	,	and	was	revealed	to	be	correlated	with	poor	clinical	outcome	.	.
s181	In	Mfrprd6	eyes	,	a	significant	1.5-	to	2.0-fold	decrease	was	observed	among	transcripts	of	genes	linked	to	retinal_degeneration	,	including	those	involved	in	visual	cycle	(	Rpe65	,	Lrat	,	Rgr	)	,	phototransduction	(	G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway	,	Guca1b	,	Rgs9	)	,	and	photoreceptor	disc	morphogenesis	(	Rrelationip1	and	Fscn2	)	.	.
s154	RT	-	PCR	analysis	showed	that	the	overall	transcriptional	activity	of	the	main	HS	biosynthesis	-	involved	genes	(	EXT1	,	EXT2	,	NDST1	,	regulation_of_angiotensin_levels_in_blood	,	GLCE	,	HS2ST1	,	HS3ST1	,	HS3ST2	,	HS6ST1	,	HS6ST2	,	SULF1	,	SULF2	,	HPSE	)	was	decreased	by	1.5	-	2-fold	in	Grade	II	-	III	glioma_(p	AAAA	0.01	)	and	by	3-fold	in	Grade	IV	glioma	(	glioblastoma	multiforme	,	GBM	)	(	p	AAAA	0.05	)	,	as	compared	with	the	para	-	tumourous	tissue	.	.
s109	Primary	renal	tricarboxylic_acid_cycle_and	neoplasia_was	associated	with	about	2	%	of	710	cases	of	PC	/	PGL	.	.
s175	Furthermore	,	the	xenograft	study	confirmed	the	tumor_proliferation	-	promoting	role	of	SPRY4-centrosome_cycle_in	PANC1	cells	.	.
s147	Mutations	and	deletions	of	the	interleukin-1	receptor	accessory	protein	like	1	(	regulation_of_postsynapse_organization	)	gene	,	located	on	the	X	chromosome	,	are	associated	with	intellectual	disability	(	ID	)	and	autism_spectrum	disorder	(	ASD	)	.	.
s103	Gene	set	enrichment	analysis	was	conducted	to	study	the	relevant	mechanisms	.	Bladder	cancer_patients	in	negative_regulation_of_endodermal_cell_differentiation_low	expression	group	were	associated	with	better	invasiveness	(	P	AAAA	.0001	)	,	tumor	grade	(	P	=	.001	)	,	T	staging	(	P	AAAA	.0001	)	,	N	staging	(	P	=	.002	)	,	cancer	specific	survival	(	P	AAAA	.0001	)	,	overall	survival	(	P	AAAA	.0001	)	,	and	a	trend	of	better	M	staging	(	P	=	.053	)	than	those	in	COL5A2	high	expression	group	.	COL5A2	might	affect	the	progression	of	bladder	cancer	through	AAAAAACoagulation	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAHypoxia	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAApical	junction	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAUltraviolet	response	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAEpithelial	mesenchymal	transition	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAAngiogenesis	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAKRAS	(	KRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	)	signaling	,	AAAAAAComplement	,	AAAAAAIL2-STAT5-signaling	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAInflammatory	response	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAIL6-JAK	-	STAT3-signaling	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAMyogenesis	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAATNF	a	signaling	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAApoptosis	,	AAAAAA	and	AAAAAAHedgehog	-	signaling	.	AAAAA	,	Our	results	demonstrated	that	COL5A2	was	correlated	with	poor	clinical	outcomes	and	survivals	of	patients	with	bladder	cancer	,	suggesting	that	it	could	be	regarded	as	a	biomarker	of	bladder	cancer	.
s187	We	surveyed	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_expression	in	24	hepatoblastomas	using	RNA	in	situ	hybridization	and	immunohistochemistry	.	.
s112	The	tumor_was	diagnosed	ACC	with	immunohistochemistry	,	positive	to	ACC	phenotype(DNA_clamp_unloading	-	antitrypsin	,	a1-antichymotrypsin	,	BCL10	)	.	.
s144	Several	tumor_suppressor	genes	and	proto	-	oncogenes	have	been	implicated	in	BCC	pathogenesis	,	including	the	key	components	of	the	Hedgehog	pathway	,	positive_regulation_of_cholesterol_efflux_and	SMO	,	the	TP53	tumor	suppressor	,	and	members	of	the	RAS	proto	-	oncogene	family	.	.
s178	Overall	,	GPT2	promotes	tumorigenesis	and	stemness	of	breast	cancer_cells	by	activating	the	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_signaling	,	suggesting	that	GTP2	is	a	potential	target	for	breast	cancer	therapy	.
s156	Growth	abnormalities	,	motor	dysfunction	,	hindlimb	paralysis	,	muscle_wasting	,	neurogenic	atrophy	,	motor	neuron	degeneration	,	and	loss	of	large	-	caliber	axons	in	peripheral	nerves	occurred	at	an	earlier	age	in	Scyl1/monocyte_chemotaxis_double	-	deficient	mice	than	in	Scyl1-deficient	mice	.	.
s80	Moreover	,	comparison	of	the	porcine	results	to	those	reported	by	human	melanoma_GWAS	indicated	shared	association	signals	notably	at	CDKAL1	and	transcription,_RNA	-	templated_loci	but	also	nearby	CCND1	,	FTO	,	PLA2G6	and	TMEM38B	-	RAD23B	loci	.	.
s142	SPG56	is	a	rare	autosomal_recessive_early	onset	complicated	form	of	HSP	caused	by	mutations	in	organic_acid_metabolic_process	.	.
s118	The	expression	of	the	ID2	,	PRELP	and	positive_regulation_of_endothelial_cell_migration_genes	was	compared	between	the	endometrium	of	women	without	endometriosis_in	the	proliferative	phase	of	their	menstrual	cycle	and	the	eutopic	and	ectopic	endometrium	of	women	with	endometriosis	in	the	proliferative	phase	.	.
s213	The	tumor_cells	resembled	pro	-	B	cells	,	and	were	CD19+IgM	-	IgD	-	CD93+CD43+CD21-CD23-VpreB+CXCR4	+	Consistent	with	the	pro	-	B	-	cell	stage	of	B	-	cell	development	,	microarray	analysis	revealed	enrichment	of	transcripts	,	including	V(D)J_recombination	,	Rag2	,	CD93	,	Vpreb1	,	Vpreb3	,	and	Igll1	We	confirmed	RAG1	expression	in	Tg26	tumors	,	and	hypothesized	that	HIV-1	matrix	protein	p17	may	directly	induce	RAG1	in	B	cells	.	.
s55	We	expand	the	knowledge	about	TTC7A	deficiency	,	describing	a	patient	with	the	mild	phenotype	of	TTC7A	deficiency	but	presenting	overlapping	features	of	SD	/	THE	and	cell_proliferation	-	CID	,	intestinal	atresia	and	inflammatory	bowel	disease	evocative	of	MIA	-	CID	,	but	also	dental_abnormalities	,	huge	forehead	,	liver	abnormalities	,	autoimmune	thyroiditis	and	hypogammaglobulinemia	,	evocative	of	SD	/	THE	.
s99	Importantly	,	loss	of	Arl13b	in	a	positive_regulation_of_cholesterol_efflux	-	deleted	mouse	model	of	MB	inhibited	tumor_formation	.	.
s47	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	positive_regulation_of_protein_ubiquitination	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s217	Serendipitously	,	we	found	that	overexpression	of	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_in	mouse	muscle	progenitor	cells	,	either	constitutively	during	development	or	inducibly	in	adult	animals	,	caused	severe	muscle	atrophy	with	features	reminiscent	of	cachexia	.	.
s204	Independent	and	pooled	analyses	verified	that	higher	proline_biosynthetic_process_mRNA	levels	were	significantly	associated	with	poor	survival	of	breast	cancer_patients	,	regardless	of	estrogen	receptor	(	ER	)	status	.	.
s169	We	found	that	multiple	oncogenic	tyrosine	kinases	directly	phosphorylated	peptidyl	-	threonine_dephosphorylation_at	Tyr-94	,	and	Tyr-94	phosphorylation	of	PDP1	was	common	in	diverse	human	cancer_cells	and	primary	leukemia	cells	from	patients	.	.
s211	Metabolic	cutis	laxa	results	from	Menkes	syndrome	,	caused	by	a	defect	in	the	ATPase	copper	transporting	alpha	(	ATP7A	)	gene	,	congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	due	to	mutations	in	subunit	7	of	the	component	of	oligomeric	Golgi	(	COG7)-congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	(	CDG	)	complex	,	combined	disorder	of	N-	and	O	-	linked	glycosylation	,	due	to	mutations	in	ATPase	H+	transporting	V0	subunit	a2	(	ATP6VOA2	)	gene	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	reductase	1	deficiency	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	synthase	deficiency	,	macrocephaly	,	alopecia	,	cutis	laxa	,	and	scoliosis_(MACS	)	syndrome	,	due	to	Ras	and	Rab	interactor	2	(	RIN2	)	mutations	,	transaldolase	deficiency	caused	by	mutations	in	the	transaldolase	1	(	TALDO1	)	gene	,	Gerodermia	osteodysplastica	due	to	mutations	in	the	golgin	,	RAB6-interacting	(	GORAB	or	SCYL1BP1	)	gene	,	and	mitogen	-	activated	pathway	(	MAP	)	kinase	defects	,	caused	by	mutations	in	several	genes	[	protein	tyrosine	phosphatase	,	non	-	receptor	-	type	11	(	PTPN11	)	,	RAF	,	NF	,	HRas	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	HRAS	)	,	B	-	Raf	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	BRAF	)	,	MEK1/2	,	KRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	KRAS	)	,	SOS	Ras	/	Rho	guanine	nucleotide	exchange	factor	2	(	SOS2	)	,	leucine	rich	repeat	scaffold	protein	(	SHOC2	)	,	NRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	NRAS	)	,	and	Raf-1	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	activation_of_MAPKK_activity	)	]	,	which	regulate	the	Ras	-	MAPK	cascade	.	.
s179	Based	upon	the	development	-	dependent	onsets	of	these	psychotomimetic	effects	,	by	using	a	DNA	microarray	technique	,	we	identified	the	WD	repeat	domain	3	(	WDR3	)	and	chitobiosyldiphosphodolichol	beta	-	mannosyltransferase	(	protein_glycosylation	)	genes	as	novel	candidates	for	schizophrenia	-	related	molecules	,	whose	mRNAs	were	up	-	regulated	in	the	adult	(	postnatal	week	seven	)	,	but	not	in	the	infant	(	postnatal	week	one	)	rats	by	an	indirect	dopamine	agonist	,	and	phencyclidine	,	an	antagonist	of	the	NMDA	receptor	.	.
s49	In	T2D	patients	,	animal_organ_morphogenesis_Arg192His	was	associated	with	earlier	age	at	diagnosis	,	and	GLP1R	Arg131Gln	was	associated	with	decreased	risk	of	cardiovascular_disease	.	.
s186	Taken	together	,	our	study	provides	the	first	functional	link	between	cell_volume_homeostasis_and	obesity	,	and	presents	insight	into	novel	pathways	that	could	be	applied	to	combat	obesity	and	type	2	diabetes	.
s208	Recently	,	we	developed	a	double	-	retargeting	strategy	whereby	gH	carries	the	GCN4	peptide	for	retargeting	to	the	noncancer_producer	Vero	-	GCN4R	cell	line	and	gD	carries	the	scFv	to	signal_transduction_for	cancer	retargeting	.	.
s26	Mutations	in	genes	involved	in	the	biosynthesis	of	the	glycosylphosphatidylinositol	(	glucosamine_catabolic_process	)	anchor	cause	autosomal_recessive_glycosylation	defects	,	with	a	wide	phenotypic	spectrum	of	intellectual	disability	,	seizures	,	minor	facial	dysmorphism	,	hypotonia	,	and	elevated	serum	alkaline	phosphatase	.	.
s30	Leptin	(	LEP	)	and	fat	mass	and	obesity	-	associated	(	DNA_dealkylation_involved_in_DNA_repair	)	alleles	are	known	to	influence	body	fat	mass	in	humans	,	potentially	via	effects	on	appetite	.	.
s74	Additionally	,	the	previously	reported	LMO1	neuroblastoma_risk	locus	was	statistically	significant	only	in	patients	with	positive_regulation_of_gene_expression	-	nonamplified	high	-	risk	tumors	(	OR	=	0.63	,	95	%	CI	=	0.53	to	0.75	,	Pmeta	=	1.51	x	10	-	8	,	Pmeta	=	.95	)	.	.
s87	From	the	integrative	analysis	of	the	transcriptome	and	clinicopathologic	data	of	human	multi	-	stage	HCC	tissues	,	we	were	able	to	identify	barrier	-	to	-	autointegration	factor	1	(	BANF1	)	,	procollagen	-	lysine	,	2-oxoglutarate	5-dioxygenase	3	(	peptidyl	-	lysine_hydroxylation	)	and	splicing	factor	3b	subunit	4	(	SF3B4	)	as	early	HCC	biomarkers	which	could	be	detected	in	precancerous	lesions	of	HCC	,	with	superior	capabilities	to	diagnose	eHCC	compared	to	the	currently	popular	HCC	diagnostic	biomarkers	,	GPC3	,	GS	,	and	HSP70	.	.
s65	Taken	together	,	we	show	that	common	DNA	variants	within	peptide_metabolic_process_at	4p16	and	upstream	of	MLF1	at	3q25	influence	neuroblastoma_susceptibility	and	MLF1	likely	plays	an	important	role	in	neuroblastoma	tumorigenesis	.
s8	However	,	the	mechanism	for	photoreceptor_cell_maintenance	-	mediated	glioma_progression	has	yet	to	be	fully	elucidated	.	.
s86	After	HDM	challenge	,	these	mice	also	had	fewer	airway	inflammatory	cells	,	reduced	interleukin	(	IL)-5	,	IL-13	,	IL-33	,	tumour_necrosis	factor	(	TNF	)	and	inflammatory_response_levels	in	the	lungs	,	and	reduced	IL-5	,	IL-33	and	TNF	levels	in	lung	-	draining	lymph	nodes	.	.
s45	This	similarity	was	revealed	by	the	same	number	of	passages	,	the	same	germ	cell	clusters	formation	and	similar	level	of	genes	expression	of	spermatogonial	markers	including	ubiquitin	carboxyl	-	terminal	esterase	L1	(	UCHL1	)	,	zinc	finger	and	BTB	domain	containing	16	(	ZBTB16	)	and	glial	cell	line	-	derived	neurotrophic	factor	family	receptor	alpha	1	(	GFRA1	)	,	as	well	as	germ	cell	differentiation	markers	including	signal	transducer	and	activator	of	transcription	3	(	STAT3	)	,	spermatogenesis	and	oogenesis	specific	basic	helix	-	loophelix	2	(	SOHLH2	)	,	v	-	activation_of_MAPK_activity_Hardy	-	Zuckerman	4	feline	sarcoma_viral	oncogene	homolog	(	KIT	)	and	synaptonemal	complex	protein	3	(	SYCP3	)	.	.
s9	establishment_of_epithelial_cell_polarity_antibodies	were	used	to	probe	78	paraffin	-	embedded	specimens	of	tongue	squamous_cell_carcinoma_and	15	normal	tongue	tissues	,	which	served	as	controls	.	.
s73	In	recent	years	,	high	-	throughput	sequencing	has	been	used	to	analyze	exomes	of	virtually	all	human	tumors	,	which	allowed	to	construct	phylogenetic	trees	of	clonal	cancer_evolution	with	special	emphasis	on	driver	mutations	in	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation-4	genes	.	.
s66	We	also	found	that	Lin28b	is	able	to	bind	a	conserved	GGAG	motif	of	pre	-	protein_polyubiquitination-125a	and	to	inhibit	its	maturation	in	hepatocellular_carcinoma_cells	.	.
s203	Furthermore	,	negative_regulation_of_peptidase_activity_expression	was	observed	in	all	22	lymph	node	metastases	analyzed	.	Relatively	high	levels	of	CSTA	expression	in	tumors	were	correlated	with	tumor	progression	and	advanced	cancer_stage	,	including	lymph	node	metastasis	.
s29	Mutations	affecting	human	COG1	,	COG2	and	COG4-intra	-	Golgi_vesicle	-	mediated_transport_cause	monogenic	forms	of	inherited	,	autosomal_recessive_CDGs	.	.
s171	Growth	abnormalities	,	motor	dysfunction	,	hindlimb	paralysis	,	muscle_wasting	,	neurogenic	atrophy	,	motor	neuron	degeneration	,	and	loss	of	large	-	caliber	axons	in	peripheral	nerves	occurred	at	an	earlier	age	in	cytoskeleton_organization	/	Scyl3	double	-	deficient	mice	than	in	Scyl1-deficient	mice	.	.
s90	Altogether	,	our	data	indicate	that	the	levels	of	these	protein_polyubiquitinationNAs	may	be	used	as	biological	markers	for	evaluating	hepatocellular_carcinoma_progression	.	.
s128	The	transcription	factor	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_is	a	master	regulator	of	the	cellular	antioxidant	response	,	and	it	is	often	genetically	activated	in	non	-	small	-	cell	lung	cancers	(	NSCLCs	)	by	,	for	instance	,	mutations	in	the	negative	regulator	KEAP1	.	.
s13	Recent	research	published	in	the	Journal	of	Pathology	showed	that	genetic	depletion	of	any	of	the	NOX2	subunits	Cyba	,	Cybb	,	protein_targeting_to_membrane	,	Ncf2	and	Ncf4	reduced	the	formation	of	lung	metastases	following	intravenous	injection	of	murine	tumor_cells	.	.
s100	The	FGF9	subfamily	,	including	FGF9	,	FGF16	,	and	negative_regulation_of_neuron_apoptotic_process	,	in	addition	to	rhFGF16	,	rhFGF9	,	and	rhFGF20	,	were	shown	to	stimulate	the	proliferation	and	migration	of	HuH7	human	hepatocellular_carcinoma_(HCC	)	cells	.	.
s135	The	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_is	a	tumor_suppressor	gene	and	found	to	interact	with	p53	,	the	trigger	for	apoptosis	through	BCl2	family	genes	and	a	regulator	of	Notch	signaling	pathway	for	the	self	-	renewal	of	stem	cells	.	.
s132	miR-142	-	3p	overexpression	resulted	in	a	strong	decline	in	breast	cancer_stem	cell	characteristics	with	a	decrease	in	CD44	,	CD133	,	ALDH1	,	Bod1	,	mitotic_cytokinesis	,	and	mammosphere	formation	as	well	as	reduced	survival	after	irradiation	.	.
s23	Taken	together	,	these	data	open	venues	for	exploring	the	possibility	that	sporadic	breast	cancer_patients	with	DNA_repair_amplification	might	benefit	from	epigenetic	combination	therapy	targeting	both	the	KDM5A	demethylase	and	histone	deacetylases	.	.
s197	Schnyder	corneal_dystrophy_(SCD	)	is	a	rare	autosomal	dominant	disease	in	humans	,	characterized	by	abnormal	deposition	of	cholesterol	and	phospholipids	in	cornea	caused	by	mutations	in	the	UbiA	prenyltransferase	domain	containing	1	(	vitamin_K_biosynthetic_process	)	gene	.	.
s174	mRNA_splicing,_via_spliceosome_regulates	various	muscle	-	related	functions	,	but	studies	have	proposed	its	role	in	development	and	angiogenesis	also	,	where	it	is	involved	with	tumor	-	associated	molecules	.	.
s218	Mutations	in	genes	involved	in	the	biosynthesis	of	the	glycosylphosphatidylinositol	(	glucosamine_catabolic_process	)	anchor	cause	autosomal_recessive_glycosylation	defects	,	with	a	wide	phenotypic	spectrum	of	intellectual	disability	,	seizures	,	minor	facial	dysmorphism	,	hypotonia	,	and	elevated	serum	alkaline	phosphatase	.	.
s113	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s76	Mutations	in	isocitrate_metabolic_process_and	IDH2	have	recently	been	observed	in	multiple	tumors	,	including	gliomas	,	acute	myeloid	leukemia	,	myelodysplastic	syndromes	,	and	chondrosarcoma	.	.
s114	A	novel	mutation	of	an	essential	splice	site	in	the	C19orf70	gene	encoding	cristae_formation_induces	severe	mitochondrial	encephalopathy	,	hepatopathy	and	lactate	acidosis	consistent	with	psychomotor	retardation	.	.
s95	Single	nucleotide	polymorphism	in	infant	genes	in	the	folate	(	MTHFS	rs12438477	)	,	homocysteine	(	TRDMT1	rs6602178	and	GNMT	rs11752813	)	and	transsulfuration	(	negative_regulation_of_protein_kinase_activity_rs7941395	and	MGST1	rs7294985	)	pathways	were	also	associated	with	an	increased	risk	of	congenital_heart_defects	.	Conclusions	Common	maternal	or	infant	genetic	variants	in	folate	,	homocysteine	,	or	transsulfuration	pathways	are	associated	with	an	increased	risk	of	certain	congenital	heart	defects	among	children	of	women	taking	SSRIs	during	cardiogenesis	.
s91	Here	,	we	found	that	protein	tyrosine	phosphatase	protein_dephosphorylation_gene	expression	was	substantially	increased	in	both	cisplatin	and	doxorubicin	-	resistant	ovarian	cancer_cells	.	.
s18	Complex	recessive	spastic_paraplegias	have	in	the	past	been	frequently	associated	with	mutations	in	SPG11	(	spatacsin	)	,	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination	/	SPG15	,	SPG7	(	paraplegin	)	and	a	handful	of	other	rare	genes	,	but	many	cases	remain	genetically	undefined	.	.
s37	In	the	present	study	,	the	results	obtained	from	our	previously	published	methylation	array	were	analyzed	and	10	candidate	genes	involved	in	DNA	repair	[	protein	phosphatase	4	catalytic	subunit	(	PPP4C	)	]	,	apoptosis	[	runt	related	transcription	factor	3	(	RUNX3	)	,	interferon	regulatory	factor	4	(	IRF4	)	,	ubiquitin	C	-	terminal	hydrolase	L1	(	UCHL1	)	and	tumor_protein	p53	inducible	protein	3	(	TP53I3	)	]	,	cell	proliferation	[	cyclin	D2	(	CCND2	)	and	Ras	association	domain	family	member	1	(	RASSF1	)	]	,	drug	metabolism	[	aldehyde	dehydrogenase	1	family	member	A3	(	ALDH1A3	)	and	solute	carrier	family	29	member	1	(	neurotransmitter_reuptake	)	]	and	angiogenesis	[	human	immunodeficiency	virus-1	tat	interactive	protein	2	(	HTATIP2	)	]	were	selected	for	quantification	of	their	methylation	levels	in	54	CCA	and	19	adjacent	normal	tissues	using	methylation	-	sensitive	high	-	resolution	melting	.	.
s200	Five	genes	,	including	OTOGL	,	PLCB4	,	SCEL	,	THSD4	,	and	negative_regulation_of_Wnt_signaling_pathway	,	have	CNVs	in	the	six	patients	with	sporadic_HBs	,	and	three	genes	,	including	ABCA6	,	CWC27	,	and	LAMA2	,	have	CNVs	in	the	five	patients	with	familial	HBs	.	.
s25	Loss	of	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_function	in	humans	and	mice	leads	to	the	development	of	several	pathologies	,	including	neonatal	diabetes	and	congenital	hypothyroidism	,	polycystic	kidney	disease	,	and	infertility	.	.
s139	Genomics	of	tumors	identified	several	new	genes	;	including	ZNRF3	in	adrenocortical	carcinomas	,	PRKACA	in	cortisol	-	producing	adrenal	adenomas	,	biological_process_in	primary	macronodular	adrenal_hyperplasia_and	USP8	in	pituitary	corticotroph	adenomas	.	.
s146	Pain	was	significantly	higher	in	anatomical_structure_morphogenesis	-	mutant	than	in	SMARCB1-mutant	patients	,	though	spinal	tumor_location	did	not	significantly	correlate	with	pain	.	.
s188	Mutations	in	isocitrate_metabolic_process_and	IDH2	have	recently	been	observed	in	multiple	tumors	,	including	gliomas	,	acute	myeloid	leukemia	,	myelodysplastic	syndromes	,	and	chondrosarcoma	.	.
s22	The	FGF9	subfamily	,	including	FGF9	,	regulation_of_endothelial_cell_proliferation	,	and	FGF20	,	in	addition	to	rhFGF16	,	rhFGF9	,	and	rhFGF20	,	were	shown	to	stimulate	the	proliferation	and	migration	of	HuH7	human	hepatocellular_carcinoma_(HCC	)	cells	.	.
s33	Meanwhile	,	the	expression	of	PTPN3	was	found	to	be	regulated	by	protein_polyubiquitination-199	in	resistant	ovarian	cancer_cells	.	.
s206	This	was	accompanied	by	neuronal_loss_and	neuro	-	axonal	dysfunction	in	adult	OL	-	potassium_ion_import_across_plasma_membrane_cKO	mice	as	shown	by	delayed	visual	evoked	potentials	,	inner	retinal	thinning	and	progressive	motor	deficits	.	.
s2	Genes	with	DMRs	were	involved	in	inflammatory	response	(	IRAK4	and	ESM1	)	,	cancer_(BRCA1	and	LASP1	)	,	endocrine	function	(	CNPY1	)	,	and	male	fertility	(	IFT140	,	positive_regulation_of_granulocyte_differentiation	,	and	PRDM8	)	.	.
s163	In	this	study	,	we	employed	a	siRNA	knockdown	approach	for	heparan	sulphate	(	EXT1	)	and	heparan	/	chondroitin	/	dermatan	sulphate	-	biosynthetic	enzymes	(	glycosaminoglycan_biosynthetic_process	)	in	the	aggressive	human	breast	cancer_cell	line	MDA	-	MB-231	to	study	the	impact	on	cell	behaviour	and	hyaluronan	biosynthesis	.	.
s214	Using	whole	-	exome	sequencing	,	we	identified	compound	heterozygous	positive_regulation_of_mitochondrial_translation_variants	in	a	4-year	-	old	patient	with	congenital	lactic	acidosis	,	severe	myopathy	,	hearing_loss	,	renal	failure	,	and	dysautonomia	.	.
s108	In	the	remaining	cases	,	next	generation	sequencing	was	carried	out	revealing	variants	in	a	number	of	other	known	complex	spastic_paraplegia_genes	,	including	five	in	SPG7	(	5/97	)	,	four	in	FA2H	(	also	known	as	SPG35	)	(	4/97	)	and	two	in	ZFYVE26/double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination_Variants	were	identified	in	genes	usually	associated	with	pure	spastic	paraplegia	and	also	in	the	Parkinson	s	disease	-	associated	gene	ATP13A2	,	neuronal	ceroid	lipofuscinosis	gene	TPP1	and	the	hereditary	motor	and	sensory	neuropathy	DNMT1	gene	,	highlighting	the	genetic	heterogeneity	of	spastic	paraplegia	.	.
s170	ETV1/4/5	factors	are	often	overexpressed	in	prostate	cancer_and	genome	-	wide	studies	in	a	prostate	cancer	cell	line	indicate	that	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_and	MED25	occupy	enhancers	that	are	enriched	for	ETS	-	binding	sequences	and	are	both	functionally	important	for	the	transcription	of	genes	regulated	by	these	enhancers	.	.
s173	Here	we	report	three	families	with	homozygous	truncating	mutations	in	vesicle_tethering_to_Golgi_who	display	moderate	to	severe	intellectual	disability	and	microcephaly	.	.
s150	Since	RAPSN	-	associated	limb	-	girdle	type	CMS	was	only	manifested	in	dADP_phosphorylation_homozygous	variant	carriers	,	the	disease	phenotype	was	of	digenic_inheritance	,	and	was	determined	by	the	novel	disease	modifier	AK9	which	provides	NTPs	for	N	-	glycosylation	.	.
s194	The	gene	expression	levels	of	Ki-67	,	BCL11A	,	FOXC1	,	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	PCDHGB7	and	her-2	were	used	as	an	auxiliary	diagnostic	index	for	patients	with	breast	cancer_in	the	early	stage	.	.
s31	In	this	study	,	we	reported	that	sex_determination_expression	was	upregulated	in	osteosarcoma_tissues	compared	with	non	-	cancerous	bone	cyst	tissues	.	.
s35	These	experiments	suggest	that	excessive	phosphorylation	of	response_to_endoplasmic_reticulum_stress_decreases	survival	of	cancer_cells	,	making	eIF2a	a	worthy	target	for	drug	development	,	with	the	potential	to	enhance	the	cytotoxic	effects	of	established	anti	-	neoplastic	therapies	and	circumvent	resistance	to	rapalogues	and	possibly	to	other	drugs	that	inhibit	upstream	components	of	the	mTOR	pathway	.
s54	proteolysis_is	an	intracellular	protease	that	mediates	the	activation	of	several	innate	and	adaptive	immune	cells	in	response	to	multiple	receptors	,	and	therapeutic	MALT1	targeting	is	believed	to	be	a	valid	approach	for	autoimmunity	and	MALT1-addicted	cancers	.	.
s137	Lymphatic	metastasis	is	facilitated	by	lymphangiogenic	growth	factor	vascular	endothelial	growth	factor	-	C	(	vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_receptor_signaling_pathway	)	that	is	secreted	by	some	primary	tumors	.	.
s84	Kluver	-	Bucy	syndrome	(	KBS	)	comprises	a	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_of	neurobehavioral	symptoms	with	psychic	blindness	,	hypersexuality	,	disinhibition	,	hyperorality	,	and	hypermetamorphosis	that	were	originally	observed	after	bilateral	lobectomy	in	Rhesus	monkeys	.	.
s199	Furthermore	,	we	found	that	tumor_necrosis	factor	(	TNF	)	receptor	-	associated	factor	5	(	TRAF5	)	and	TGF	-	b	activated	kinase	1	(	activation_of_MAPKK_activity	)	binding	protein	1	(	TAB1	)	were	direct	targets	of	miR-873	in	CRC	cells	.	.
s3	A	plethora	of	human	diseases	are	associated	with	mutations	in	the	genes	encoding	human	SLC26	transporters	,	including	chondrodysplasias	with	varying	severity	in	SLC26A2	(	~50	mutations	,	27	point	mutations	)	,	congenital	chloride	-	losing	diarrhea	in	sperm_capacitation_(~70	mutations	,	31	point	mutations	)	and	Pendred	Syndrome	or	deafness_autosomal	recessive	type	4	in	SLC26A4	(	~500	mutations	,	203	point	mutations	)	.	.
s75	Recent	studies	have	suggested	possible	therapeutic	targets	for	some	patients	with	early	-	onset	glaucoma_based	on	the	molecular	and	cellular	events	caused	by	MYOC	,	OPTN	and	protein_phosphorylation_mutations	.	.
s62	In	summary	,	our	results	reveal	that	rare	loss	-	of	-	function	variants	in	signal_transduction_increase	the	risk	for	a	varying	combination	of	epilepsy	,	intellectual	disability	/	developmental	delay	and	dysmorphic	features	,	presenting	in	some	pedigrees	with	an	X	-	linked	inheritance	pattern	.
s121	In	particular	,	MYH9	mutations	result	in	congenital	macrothrombocytopenia_and	predispose	to	kidney	failure	,	hearing	loss	,	and	cataracts	,	MPL	and	MECOM	mutations	cause	congenital	thrombocytopenia	evolving	into	bone	marrow	failure	,	whereas	thrombocytopenias	caused	by	RUNX1	,	ANKRD26	,	and	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_mutations	are	characterized	by	predisposition	to	hematological	malignancies	.	.
s82	These	findings	support	that	UNC119	is	a	regulator	of	the	apoptotic_process	-	MDM2-p53	axis	and	functions	as	a	tumor_suppressor	.
s28	In	neonatal	seizures	,	defects	in	ALDH7A1	and	pyridoxal_phosphate_biosynthetic_process_explain	a	major	fraction	of	cases	.	.
s152	Encapsulation	of	mirin	in	nanoparticles	allowed	its	use	on	MYCN	-	amplified	neuroblastoma	xenografts	in	vivo	,	which	resulted	in	a	sharp	impairment	of	tumor_growth	,	associated	with	DDR	activation	,	DNA_strand_renaturation_accumulation	,	and	cell	death	.	.
s116	The	results	indicated	that	compared	with	the	adjacent	non	-	tumor	tissues	and	a	normal	gastric	epithelial	cell	line	,	gastric	cancer_tissues	and	cell	lines	exhibited	significantly	higher	expression	of	proteasomal_protein_catabolic_process	.	.
s140	X	-	inactive	specific	transcript	(	XIST	)	,	premature_ovarian_failure_1B	(	epithelial_cell_morphogenesis	)	and	calmin	(	CLMN	)	were	identified	in	the	DEmRNA	-	DElncRNA	co	-	expression	network	.	.
s153	Mutations	in	genes	involved	in	the	biosynthesis	of	the	glycosylphosphatidylinositol	(	glucosamine_catabolic_process	)	anchor	cause	autosomal	recessive	glycosylation	defects	,	with	a	wide	phenotypic	spectrum	of	intellectual_disability	,	seizures	,	minor	facial	dysmorphism	,	hypotonia	,	and	elevated	serum	alkaline	phosphatase	.	.
s15	Here	,	we	applied	domain	-	focused	CRISPR	screening	to	human	cancer_cell	lines	to	identify	the	transcription	factor	(	TF	)	POU2F3	(	POU	class	2	homeobox	3	,	also	known	as	negative_regulation_by_host_of_viral_transcription	/	OCT-11	)	as	a	powerful	dependency	in	a	subset	of	SCLC	lines	.	.
s119	Overexpression	of	many	factors	predicted	poor	prognosis	in	breast	(	cellular_response_to_ionizing_radiation	,	EEF1E1	,	EEF2	)	and	lung	cancer_(EEF1A2	,	EEF1B2	,	EEF1	G	,	EEF1E1	)	.	.
s157	The	linear	ubiquitination	-	specific	deubiquitinase	ovarian	tumor_domain	deubiquitinase	with	linear	linkage	specificity	(	regulation_of_tumor_necrosis_factor	-	mediated_signaling_pathway	)	can	control	the	immune	signaling	transduction	pathway	by	restricting	the	Met1-linked	ubiquitination	process	.	.
s193	Bardet	Biedl	syndrome	(	visual_perception	)	is	a	multisystem	genetically	heterogeneous	ciliopathy	that	most	commonly	leads	to	obesity	,	photoreceptor	degeneration	,	digit	anomalies	,	genito	-	urinary	abnormalities	,	as	well	as	cognitive	impairment	with	autism	,	among	other	features	.	.
s183	Here	,	we	have	performed	a	prospective	nationwide	genetic	association	study	using	the	Human	Exome	BeadChip	and	identified	gene	variants	in	encoding	dynactin	4	(	DCTN4	)	,	retinoic	acid	early	transcript	1E	(	RAET1E	)	,	and	V	-	akt	murine	thymoma	viral	oncogene	homolog	3	(	positive_regulation_of_blood_vessel_endothelial_cell_migration	)	to	be	associated	with	unfavourable	outcome	in	patients	with	pneumococcal	meningitis	.	.
s17	In	an	effort	to	circumvent	resistance	to	rapamycin	--	an	regulation_of_cell_growth_inhibitor	--	we	searched	for	novel	rapamycin	-	downstream	-	targets	that	may	be	key	players	in	the	response	of	cancer_cells	to	therapy	.	.
s94	Collectively	,	our	study	uncovers	a	protein	complex	,	which	consists	of	FIGNL1	and	KIAA0146/cellular_response_to_DNA_damage_stimulus	,	in	DNA	repair	and	provides	potential	directions	for	cancer_diagnosis	and	therapy	.	.
s190	negative_regulation_of_epithelial_cell_migration	,	a	transmembrane	glycoprotein	,	has	emerged	as	a	biomarker	for	targeted	cancer_therapy	since	it	is	overexpressed	in	80	%	of	triple	negative	breast	cancer	(	TNBC	)	patients	.	.
s68	We	analyzed	the	expression	of	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_in	148	patients	with	breast	cancer	.	.
s5	PurposeMonoallelic	germ	-	line	mutations	in	the	BRCA1/FANCS	,	mitotic_cytokinesis	/	FANCD1	and	PALB2/FANCN	genes	confer	high	risk	of	breast	cancer	.	.
s56	Highlights	include	the	discoveries	of	(	i	)	a	new	genetic	etiology	,	autosomal_recessive_SPPL2a	deficiency	,	(	ii	)	TYK2-deficient	patients	with	a	clinical	phenotype	of	MSMD	,	(	iii	)	an	allelic	form	of	partial	recessive	adaptive_immune_response	-	yR2	deficiency	,	and	(	iv	)	two	forms	of	syndromic	MSMD	,	RORy	/	RORyT	and	JAK1	deficiencies	.	.
s180	Similar	findings	were	observed	in	a	patient	with	chronic	hypophosphatemia_as	a	result	of	a	mutation	in	sodium_ion_transport_who	had	a	50	%	reduction	in	both	serum	Pi	content	and	muscle	VATP	After	oral	Pi	repletion	and	normalization	of	serum	Pi	levels	,	muscle	VATP	completely	normalized	in	the	patient	.	.
s97	Kluver	-	Bucy	syndrome	(	KBS	)	comprises	a	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_of	neurobehavioral	symptoms	with	psychic	blindness	,	hypersexuality	,	disinhibition	,	hyperorality	,	and	hypermetamorphosis	that	were	originally	observed	after	bilateral	lobectomy	in	Rhesus	monkeys	.	.
s141	Here	we	established	a	mutation	detection	system	based	on	multiple	fluorescent	probe	technique	,	which	can	detect	and	genotype	nine	hotspot	mutations	of	four	prominent	hearing_loss	-	related	genes	in	two	reactions	on	a	four	-	channel	real	-	time	PCR	instrument	,	including	GJB2	(	rs750188782	,	rs80338943	,	rs1110333204	,	and	rs80338939	)	,	GJB3	(	rs74315319	)	,	regulation_of_pH_(rs111033313	and	rs121908362	)	,	and	mtDNA	12S	rRNA	(	rs267606617	and	rs267606619	)	.	.
s115	pyruvate_metabolic_process	-	M	(	PCK2	)	,	the	mitochondrial	isoform	of	phosphoenolpyruvate	carboxykinase	(	PEPCK	)	,	has	been	shown	by	us	and	others	to	be	functionally	expressed	and	to	mediate	gluconeogenesis	,	the	reverse	pathway	of	glycolysis	,	in	different	cancer_cells	.	.
s185	Our	findings	show	that	GPI_anchor_biosynthetic_process_mutations	may	lead	to	an	isolated	and	mild	limb	girdle	muscular_dystrophy_phenotype	without	cardiomyopathy	.
s69	A	heterozygous	mutation	in	the	Wolfram	syndrome	type	1	gene	(	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	)	causes	autosomal	dominant	nonsyndromic	hereditary	hearing_loss	,	DFNA6/14/38	,	or	Wolfram	-	like	syndrome	.	.
s81	Furthermore	,	in	utero	CRISPR	-	Cas9-mediated	genome	editing	of	Tsc1	or	positive_regulation_of_macroautophagy_induced	the	development	of	spontaneous	behavioral	seizures	,	as	well	as	cytomegalic	neurons	and	cortical	dyslamination	.	.
s41	Notably	,	negative_regulation_of_Wnt_signaling_pathway_with	Ser14	phosphorylation	is	upregulated	in	the	lesions	of	cancer	,	as	well	as	in	the	brain	hippocampus	and	cortex	with	Alzheimer	s	disease	.	.
s165	Furthermore	,	we	investigated	whether	there	is	an	association	between	the	mRNA	and	protein	expression	levels	of	RBCK1	,	protein_polyubiquitination_and	SHARPIN	and	clinicopathological	parameters	including	estrogen	receptor	(	ER	)	,	progesterone	receptor	(	PR	)	and	human	epidermal	growth	factor	receptor	(	HER2	)	status	and	found	that	RNF31	protein	is	significantly	higher	in	ERalpha	-	negative	tumors	than	ERalpha	-	positive	tumors	(	p	=	0.034	)	.	.
s50	Importantly	,	bone	cell	activity	was	inversely	correlated	to	tumor_cell	AR	activity	(	measured	as	AR	,	FOXA1	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	KLK2	,	KLK3	,	NKX3	-	1	,	STEAP2	,	and	TMPRSS2	expression	)	and	to	patient	serum	prostate	-	specific	antigen	(	PSA	)	levels	.	.
s184	Metabolic	cutis	laxa	results	from	Menkes	syndrome	,	caused	by	a	defect	in	the	ATPase	copper	transporting	alpha	(	ATP7A	)	gene	,	congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	due	to	mutations	in	subunit	7	of	the	component	of	oligomeric	Golgi	(	COG7)-congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	(	CDG	)	complex	,	combined	disorder	of	N-	and	O	-	linked	glycosylation	,	due	to	mutations	in	ATPase	H+	transporting	V0	subunit	a2	(	ATP6VOA2	)	gene	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	reductase	1	deficiency	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	synthase	deficiency	,	macrocephaly	,	alopecia	,	cutis	laxa	,	and	scoliosis	(	MACS	)	syndrome	,	due	to	Ras	and	Rab	interactor	2	(	RIN2	)	mutations	,	transaldolase	deficiency	caused	by	mutations	in	the	transaldolase	1	(	TALDO1	)	gene	,	Gerodermia	osteodysplastica	due	to	mutations	in	the	golgin	,	peptidyl	-	cysteine_methylation	-	interacting	(	GORAB	or	SCYL1BP1	)	gene	,	and	mitogen	-	activated	pathway	(	MAP	)	kinase	defects	,	caused	by	mutations	in	several	genes	[	protein	tyrosine	phosphatase	,	non	-	receptor	-	type	11	(	PTPN11	)	,	RAF	,	NF	,	HRas	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	HRAS	)	,	B	-	Raf	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	BRAF	)	,	MEK1/2	,	KRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	KRAS	)	,	SOS	Ras	/	Rho	guanine	nucleotide	exchange	factor	2	(	SOS2	)	,	leucine	rich	repeat	scaffold	protein	(	SHOC2	)	,	NRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	NRAS	)	,	and	Raf-1	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	RAF1	)	]	,	which	regulate	the	Ras	-	MAPK	cascade	.	.
s122	Consistent	with	this	result	,	mutations	in	the	learning_gene	coding	for	CASPR2	in	human	have	been	identified	in	neurodevelopmental	disorders	such	as	autism	,	intellectual_disability	,	and	epilepsy	.	.
s107	Moreover	,	inhibition	of	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_target	pyrimidine	synthesis	genes	such	as	CAD	,	UMPS	,	and	CTPS	blocked	cell	growth	,	and	thus	are	potential	targets	for	colorectal	cancer_therapy	.
s14	Addition	of	exogenous	negative_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_(6XHis	-	tagged	,	E.	coli	expressed	and	partially	purified	using	Ni	-	ion	columns	)	significantly	suppressed	the	tumor_necrosis	factor	-	a	(	TNF	-	a)-stimulated	human	umbilical	cord	vascular	endothelial	cell	(	HUVEC	)	tube	formation	.	.
s53	Four	of	the	five	genes	,	including	AKAP12	,	SOPB	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	COL12A1	and	TXNIP	were	downregulated	,	and	were	associated	with	the	OS	of	patients	with	breast	carcinoma	.	.
s12	Moreover	,	the	novel	mutation	,	p	.	R414C	,	adds	up	to	the	literature	for	the	infantile	-	onset	form	of	autosomal_recessive_ataxia	associated	with	vesicle	-	mediated_transport	.	.
s131	In	humans	,	mutations	in	regulation_of_autophagy_result	in	Wolfram	syndrome	2	,	a	disease	in	which	the	patients	display	juvenile	diabetes	,	neuropsychiatric	disorders	and	defective_platelet_aggregation	.	.
s201	Mutations	in	the	kinesin	family	member	1A	(	anterograde_neuronal_dense_core_vesicle_transport	)	gene	have	been	associated	with	a	wide	range	of	phenotypes	including	recessive	mutations	causing	hereditary	sensory	neuropathy	and	hereditary	spastic_paraplegia_and	de	novo	dominant	mutations	causing	a	more	complex	neurological	disorder	affecting	both	the	central	and	peripheral	nervous	system	.	.
s83	Schnyder	corneal_dystrophy_(quaternary_ammonium_group_transport	)	is	a	rare	autosomal	dominant	disease	in	humans	,	characterized	by	abnormal	deposition	of	cholesterol	and	phospholipids	in	cornea	caused	by	mutations	in	the	UbiA	prenyltransferase	domain	containing	1	(	UBIAD1	)	gene	.	.

s205	The	mammalian	target	of	rapamycin	(	regulation_of_cell_growth	)	pathway	is	overactivated	in	thyroid	cancer_(TC	)	.	.
s11	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	biological_process	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s6	The	immunohistochemical	expression	of	cell	-	matrix_adhesion_in	corresponding	tissue	was	significantly	higher	in	metastases	than	in	glioblastomas	.	The	present	study	demonstrates	high	levels	of	L1CAM	in	cyst	fluid	of	glioblastoma	and	metastatic	brain	tumors	.	.
s88	In	addition	,	the	knockdown	of	fatty_acid_metabolic_process_inhibited	the	migratory	and	invasive	ability	of	liver	cancer_cells	,	whereas	increased	migration	and	invasion	rates	were	observed	in	cells	with	ectopic	expression	of	MORC2	.	.
