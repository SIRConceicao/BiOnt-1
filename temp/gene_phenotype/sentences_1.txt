s124	We	previously	mapped	a	locus	(	ahl8	)	contributing	to	the	progressive	hearing_loss_of	DBA/2J	(	D2	)	mice	and	later	showed	that	a	missense	variant	of	the	actin_cytoskeleton_organization_gene	,	unique	to	the	D2	inbred	strain	,	was	responsible	for	the	ahl8	effect	.	.
s2194	Furthermore	,	the	Gene	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_Enrichment	Analysis	results	demonstrated	that	USP18	may	be	negatively	associated	with	apoptosis	in	patients	with	breast	cancer	.	.
s1575	In	humans	,	mutations	in	double	-	strand_break_repair_lead	to	severe	myo-	and	neuro	-	degenerative	disorders	such	as	inclusion	body	myopathy	with	Paget	disease	of	the	bone	and	frontotemporal_dementia_(IBMPFD	)	,	amyotrophic	lateral	sclerosis	(	ALS	)	or	and	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	(	HSP	)	.	.
s706	protein_polyubiquitination-26a	,	miR-548l	and	miR-34a	,	acting	as	tumor_suppressors	,	may	exert	their	effects	by	regulating	ST3GAL5	.
s737	Our	objective	was	to	identify	the	CpG	loci	that	are	persistently	hyper	-	methylated	during	serrated	carcinogenesis	,	from	the	early	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	/	P	lesion	through	the	later	cancer_phases	of	neoplasia	development	.	.
s1097	The	most	important	parameters	to	consider	when	determining	arrhythmic	risk	include	electric	instability	,	including	the	frequency	of	premature_ventricular_contractions_and	sustained	ventricular	arrhythmia	,	proband	status	,	extent	of	structural	disease	,	cardiac	syncope	,	male	sex	,	the	presence	of	multiple	mutations	or	a	mutation	in	nuclear_membrane_organization	,	and	the	patient	s	willingness	to	restrict	exercise	and	to	eliminate	participation	in	competitive	or	endurance	exercise	.
s1530	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	aging	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s2818	Collagen	type	4	alpha	1	(	COL4A1	)	and	collagen	type	13	alpha	1	(	cell	-	matrix_adhesion	)	produced	by	urothelial	cancer_cells	support	the	vital	oncogenic	property	of	tumor	invasion	.	.
s2186	In	summary	,	we	provide	novel	evidence	that	the	expresmelanosome_organizationon	of	Cx31	was	decreased	in	thyroid	cancer_cells	,	but	Rg1	treatment	could	significantly	enhance	the	expression	of	Cx31	thereby	suppressing	thyroid	cancer	cell	proliferation	and	migration	.
s4	In	a	large	Scottish	pedigree	,	a	balanced	translocation	t	(	1,11)(q42.1,q14.3	)	disrupting	the	microtubule_cytoskeleton_organization_and	DISC2	genes	segregates	with	major	mental	illness	,	including	schizophrenia_and	depression	.	.
s1492	In	addition	,	these	POU6F2	RGCs	die	early	in	the	monocyte_chemotaxis/2J	model	of	glaucoma_than	most	RGCs	.	.
s4009	However	,	the	effects	of	the	microRNA	protein_polyubiquitination-142	-	3p	,	a	small	endogenous	regulator	of	gene	expression	on	breast	cancer_stem	cells	,	have	not	been	investigated	.	.
s2686	Five	genes	,	including	OTOGL	,	PLCB4	,	keratinocyte_differentiation	,	THSD4	,	and	WWOX	,	have	CNVs	in	the	six	patients	with	sporadic_HBs	,	and	three	genes	,	including	ABCA6	,	CWC27	,	and	LAMA2	,	have	CNVs	in	the	five	patients	with	familial	HBs	.	.
s132	Surprisingly	,	we	detected	no	binding_of_sperm_to_zona_pellucida	,	CALR3	and	SAGE1	in	the	67	lung	cancers	(	mainly	non	-	small	lung	cancer	)	and	189	breast	cancers	,	while	MAGE	-	A	proteins	were	present	in	15	%	and	7	-	16	%	of	these	tumor	types	,	respectively	.	.
s3756	Bartter	syndrome	type	IV	,	characterized	by	salt	-	losing	nephropathies	and	sensorineural	deafness	,	is	caused	by	mutations	of	BSND	or	simultaneous	mutations	of	both	CLCNKA	and	excretion	.	.
s1254	Neonatal	-	onset	multiple	acyl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	deficiency	(	fatty_acid_beta	-	oxidation_using_acyl	-	CoA_dehydrogenase_type	I	)	is	an	autosomal_recessive_disorder	of	the	electron	transfer	flavoprotein	function	characterized	by	a	severe	clinical	and	biochemical	phenotype	,	including	congenital	abnormalities	with	unresponsiveness	to	riboflavin	treatment	as	distinguishing	features	.	.
s1721	Overall	,	the	results	show	that	MED1/ER	-	a	/	protein_polyubiquitination-191	axis	promotes	breast	cancer_cell	proliferation	and	migration	and	may	serve	as	a	novel	target	for	therapy	.
s1341	Here	we	show	that	the	microphthalmia	-	associated	transcription	factor	,	MITF	,	which	plays	a	central	role	in	the	development	and	function	of	RPE	cells	,	regulates	the	expression	of	two	visual	cycle	genes	,	Rlbp1	which	encodes	retinaldehyde	binding	protein-1	(	RLBP1	)	,	and	Rdh5	,	which	encodes	retinol	dehydrogenase-5	(	retinoid_metabolic_process	)	.	.
s702	Other	genes	such	as	GBA2	and	anterograde_neuronal_dense_core_vesicle_transport_were	almost	simultaneously	published	as	both	a	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	and	an	ataxia_gene	.	.
s704	Identification	of	protein_polyubiquitinationNAs	related	to	metastasis	enables	us	to	obtain	better	insight	into	cancer_development	.	.
s288	A	novel	15-gene	signature	identified	82.4	%	of	the	tumours	with	bone	metastasis	,	85.2	%	of	the	tumours	which	had	bone	metastasis	as	first	site	of	metastasis	and	100	%	of	the	ones	with	bone	metastasis	only	(	p	9.99e-09	)	,	in	the	training	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	.	.
s2499	CHD	proteins	play	an	important	role	in	neurodevelopment	,	as	pathogenic	variants	in	CHD1	,	CHD2	,	ATP	-	dependent_chromatin_remodeling	,	CHD7	and	CHD8	have	been	associated	with	a	range	of	neurological	phenotypes	,	including	autism	spectrum	disorder	(	ASD	)	,	intellectual_disability_(ID	)	and	epilepsy	.	.
s1890	Therefore	,	we	propose	that	MRE11	inhibition	might	be	an	effective	strategy	to	treat	MYCN	-	amplified	and	DNA_strand_renaturation_wild	-	type	neuroblastoma	,	and	suggest	that	targeting	replication	stress	with	appropriate	tools	should	be	further	exploited	to	tackle	MYCN	-	driven	tumors	.
s3426	Using	super	-	resolution	and	electron	microscopy	,	we	find	that	the	human	microcephaly_protein	,	centriole_replication	,	is	recruited	to	the	proximal	end	of	the	procentriole	at	early	S	phase	,	and	is	located	at	the	inner	luminal	walls	of	centrioles	.	.
s3326	The	linear	ubiquitination	-	specific	deubiquitinase	ovarian	tumor_domain	deubiquitinase	with	linear	linkage	specificity	(	OTULIN	)	can	control	the	immune	signaling	transduction	pathway	by	restricting	the	cell_death	-	linked	ubiquitination	process	.	.
s2355	Using	whole	-	exome	sequencing	,	we	identified	compound	heterozygous	positive_regulation_of_mitochondrial_translation_variants	in	a	4-year	-	old	patient	with	congenital	lactic	acidosis	,	severe	myopathy	,	hearing	loss	,	renal	failure	,	and	dysautonomia	.	.
s164	We	show	that	determination_of_left	/	right_symmetry_is	required	for	cilia	rotation	specifically	in	Kupffer	s	vesicle	,	the	zebrafish	laterality	organ	,	providing	a	mechanism	by	which	patients	with	CFAP53	mutations	develop	dextrocardia_and	heterotaxy	,	and	confirming	previous	evidence	that	left	-	right	asymmetry	in	humans	is	regulated	through	cilia	-	driven	fluid	flow	in	a	laterality	organ	.	.
s604	Genes	with	DMRs	were	involved	in	inflammatory	response	(	neutrophil_mediated_immunity_and	ESM1	)	,	cancer_(BRCA1	and	LASP1	)	,	endocrine	function	(	CNPY1	)	,	and	male	fertility	(	IFT140	,	TESC	,	and	PRDM8	)	.	.
s2995	The	anti	-	miR	-	negative_regulation_of_cell_adhesion_reduced	OXPHOS	complex	activity	and	increased	in	vitro	cellular	proliferation	and	promoted	tumor_development	in	vivo	in	mice	.	.
s3228	We	find	that	STX3	promotes	the	proliferation	of	breast	cancer_cells	by	increasing	the	activation	of	the	Akt	-	mTOR	signaling	,	and	Akt	inhibitor	Ipatasertib	or	response_to_wounding-2206	represses	STX3	effects	on	the	growth	of	breast	cancer	cells	.	.
s725	With	this	data	-	driven	weighting	procedure	the	LRT	detected	significant	signal	in	genes	located	in	regions	already	confirmed	as	associated	with	schizophrenia_-	the	PRRC2A	(	p	=	1.020e-06	)	and	the	valyl	-	tRNA_aminoacylation_(p	=	2.383e-06	)	;	in	the	Swedish	schizophrenia	case	-	control	cohort	of	11,040	individuals	with	exome	-	sequencing	data	.	.
s1018	PurposeMonoallelic	germ	-	line	mutations	in	the	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination	/	FANCS	,	BRCA2/FANCD1	and	PALB2/FANCN	genes	confer	high	risk	of	breast	cancer	.	.
s3100	Mutations	of	the	five	genes	(	regulation_of_GTPase_activity	,	ANKRD20A2	,	ZNF595	,	ZNF812	,	MYO18B	)	may	be	potential	germline	mutations	of	lung	cancer	.	.
s1281	transcription,_DNA	-	templated	-	induced	changes	in	intracellular	concentrations	of	thyroid	hormones	were	quantified	by	L	-	MS	/	MS	and	correlations	between	expression	of	DIO1	and	potential	target	genes	were	determined	in	tissue	samples	from	renal	cancer_patients	.	.
s3368	Lamb	-	Shaffer	syndrome	(	OMIM	,	616803	)	is	a	neurodevelopmental	disorder	characterized	by	developmental	delay	,	mild	to	moderate	intellectual	disability	,	speech_delay	,	and	mild	characteristic	facial	appearance	caused	by	positive_regulation_of_chondrocyte_differentiation_haploinsufficiency	on	chromosome	12p12.1	.	.
s347	In	the	remaining	cases	,	next	generation	sequencing	was	carried	out	revealing	variants	in	a	number	of	other	known	complex	spastic	paraplegia	genes	,	including	five	in	SPG7	(	5/97	)	,	four	in	FA2H	(	also	known	as	SPG35	)	(	4/97	)	and	two	in	ZFYVE26/SPG15	Variants	were	identified	in	genes	usually	associated	with	pure	spastic	paraplegia	and	also	in	the	Parkinson	s	disease	-	associated	gene	ATP13A2	,	neuronal	ceroid	lipofuscinosis	gene	proteolysis_and	the	hereditary	motor	and	sensory	neuropathy_DNMT1	gene	,	highlighting	the	genetic	heterogeneity	of	spastic	paraplegia	.	.
s574	Pkm2	deletion	accelerated	tumor	formation	in	medulloblastoma	-	prone	ND2,SmoA1	mice	,	indicating	the	disrupting	programmed_cell_death_releases	CGNPs	from	a	tumor	-	suppressive	effect	.	.
s8	We	found	that	a	downregulation	of	rRNA	synthesis	,	induced	by	silencing	the	negative_regulation_of_protein_localization_to_nucleolus_gene	coding	for	the	RNA	polymerase	I	catalytic	subunit	,	stabilised	p53	without	altering	the	nucleolar	integrity	in	human	cancer_cells	.	.
s3010	This	led	to	the	identification	of	compound	heterozygous	mutations	in	negative_regulation_of_phosphatase_activity	,	a	gene	previously	associated	with	cerebellar_ataxia	,	intellectual	disability	and	quadrupedal	locomotion	.	.
s2929	Whole	exome	sequencing	of	the	patient	and	his	parents	ruled	out	mutations	in	11	known	hypodontia	-	associated	genes	including	canonical_Wnt_signaling_pathway	,	MSX1	,	EDA	,	EDAR	,	EDARADD	,	PAX9	,	AXIN2	,	GREM2	,	NEMO	,	KRT17	,	and	TFAP2B.	.
s2528	Together	,	these	observations	suggest	that	Zyxin	promotes	colon	cancer_tumorigenesis	in	a	mitotic	-	phosphorylation	-	dependent	manner	and	through	CDK8-mediated	regulation_of_cell_cycle_activation	.
s1157	Moreover	,	the	novel	mutation	,	p	.	R414C	,	adds	up	to	the	literature	for	the	infantile	-	onset	form	of	autosomal	recessive	ataxia_associated	with	vesicle	-	mediated_transport	.	.
s1327	She	manifested	macrocephaly	,	preaxial	polysyndactyly	,	psychomotor	developmental	delay	,	cerebral	cavernous	malformations	,	and	glucose	intolerance	due	to	a	6.2-Mb	deletion	of	7p14.1p12.3	which	included	GLI3	,	GCK	,	and	vasculogenesis	.	.
s26	The	novel	aspects	of	this	study	are	the	direct	identification	of	serine	biosynthesis	as	a	critical	mechanism	of	protein_phosphorylation_V600E	inhibitor	resistance	and	the	first	successful	example	of	using	gemcitabine	+	BRAFis	in	combination	to	kill	previously	drug	-	resistant	cancer	cells	,	creating	the	translational	potential	of	pretreatment	with	gemcitabine	prior	to	BRAFi	treatment	of	tumor_cells	to	reverse	resistance	within	the	mutational	profile	and	the	WT	.	.
s1551	More	importantly	,	proteolysis_expression	was	upregulated	compared	to	normal	samples	in	published	expression	data	sets	from	several	cancers	including	CRC	.	.
s3118	The	anti	-	protein_polyubiquitination-663	reduced	OXPHOS	complex	activity	and	increased	in	vitro	cellular	proliferation	and	promoted	tumor_development	in	vivo	in	mice	.	.
s3901	We	found	monoallelic	truncating	/	functionally	deleterious	mutations	in	seven	genes	,	including	ATM	and	CHEK2	,	which	have	previously	been	associated	with	PrCa	predisposition	,	and	five	new	candidate	PrCa	associated	genes	involved	in	cancer_predisposing	recessive	disorders	,	namely	RAD51C	,	FANCD2	,	FANCI	,	CEP57	and	DNA_strand_renaturation	.	.
s1666	These	findings	represent	an	approach	to	inhibiting	tumor	-	stromal	interactions	and	support	the	development	of	allosteric	inhibitors	of	peptidyl	-	tyrosine_phosphorylation	,	such	as	WRG-28	,	as	a	promising	approach	to	antimetastasis	treatment	.
s3043	This	finding	provides	concrete	evidence	that	inhibition	of	both	MDH1	and	malate_metabolic_process_may	provide	a	valuable	platform	for	developing	novel	therapeutics	that	target	cancer	metabolism	and	tumor_growth	.
s1804	The	gene	expression	levels	of	Ki-67	,	BCL11A	,	eye_development	,	HOXD13	,	PCDHGB7	and	her-2	were	used	as	an	auxiliary	diagnostic	index	for	patients	with	breast	cancer_in	the	early	stage	.	.
s1310	In	2016	,	two	research	groups	independently	identified	microdeletions	and	pathogenic	variants	in	the	lysine	-	specific	histone	methyltransferase	2B	gene	,	histone_H3-K4_methylation_in	patients	with	early	-	onset	progressive	dystonia	.	.
s1314	Finally	,	in	colon	cancer_cells	,	we	prove	that	the	Wnt_signaling_pathway,_calcium_modulating_pathway	/	PI3	K	axis	elicited	by	FzM1.8	preserves	stemness	and	promotes	proliferation	of	undifferentiated	cells	.
s336	Complex	recessive	spastic_paraplegias	have	in	the	past	been	frequently	associated	with	mutations	in	SPG11	(	spatacsin	)	,	ZFYVE26/SPG15	,	regulation_of_mitochondrial_membrane_permeability_(paraplegin	)	and	a	handful	of	other	rare	genes	,	but	many	cases	remain	genetically	undefined	.	.
s274	In	contrast	,	the	SYT8/skeletal_muscle_contraction_fusion	transcript	resulting	from	transcription	-	induced	chimerism	by	read	-	through	mechanisms	was	a	rather	common	and	tumor	-	specific	event	occurring	in	37.5	%	(	18/48	)	of	the	UC	specimens	.	.
s2746	Here	,	we	report	that	variants	in	protein_complex_oligomerization_result	in	progressive	childhood	encephalopathy	.	.
s1112	Tricho	-	hepato	-	enteric	syndrome	(	negative_regulation_of_protein_export_from_nucleus	/	THE	)	and	Multiple	intestinal	atresia	with	combined	immune	deficiency	(	MIA	-	CID	)	are	autosomal_recessive_disorders	that	present	immunological	and	gastrointestinal	features	.	.
s2292	inflammatory_response	-	null	mice	presented	with	a	phenotype	of	OPLL	,	showing	motor	impairment	,	heterotopic_ossification_in	the	posterior	ligament	tissue	,	and	osteoporosis	in	vertebrate	tissue	.	.
s2397	These	findings	suggest	that	membrane_protein_ectodomain_proteolysis_could	potentially	contribute	to	metastases	of	oral	cancer	.	.
s2966	A	plethora	of	human	diseases	are	associated	with	mutations	in	the	genes	encoding	human	SLC26	transporters	,	including	chondrodysplasias	with	varying	severity	in	SLC26A2	(	~50	mutations	,	27	point	mutations	)	,	congenital	chloride	-	losing	diarrhea	in	SLC26A3	(	~70	mutations	,	31	point	mutations	)	and	Pendred	Syndrome	or	deafness_autosomal	recessive	type	4	in	regulation_of_pH_(~500	mutations	,	203	point	mutations	)	.	.
s2452	Methods	,	Fourteen	haplotype	-	tagging	single	nucleotide	polymorphisms	(	htSNPs	)	of	MLH1	,	mismatch_repair_and	MSH2	genes	were	genotyped	by	Sequenom	MassARRAY	method	in	146	patients	with	locally	advanced	rectal	cancer_who	received	preoperative	chemoradiotherapy	.	.
s1134	Using	this	gene	panel	,	we	were	able	to	identify	disease	-	causing	variants	in	17	out	of	87	(	19.5	%	)	analyzed	patients	,	all	found	in	known	epilepsy	-	associated	genes	(	potassium_ion_transmembrane_transport	,	CDKL5	,	STXBP1	,	SCN1A	,	PCDH19	,	POLG	,	SLC2A1	,	ARX	,	ALG13	,	CHD2	,	SYNGAP1	,	and	GRIN1	)	.	.
s82	In	Mfrprd6	eyes	,	a	significant	1.5-	to	2.0-fold	decrease	was	observed	among	transcripts	of	genes	linked	to	retinal_degeneration	,	including	those	involved	in	visual	cycle	(	Rpe65	,	Lrat	,	Rgr	)	,	phototransduction	(	G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway	,	Guca1b	,	Rgs9	)	,	and	photoreceptor	disc	morphogenesis	(	Rrelationip1	and	Fscn2	)	.	.
s645	Tumor	growth	in	xenografts	as	well	as	EGFR	signaling	were	assessed	in	HCT116	cells	expressing	IL17RD	with	either	a	mutant	3	_	untranslated	region	(	UTR	)	or	wild	-	type	(	WT	)	3	UTR.Results	,	protein_polyubiquitination-31	,	miR-34a	,	miR-106b	,	and	miR-193a-3p	were	significantly	dysregulated	in	ulcerative	colitis	-	neoplasia_and	adjacent	tissue	.	.
s3677	Transcriptomic	analysis	revealed	significant	alterations	in	a	number	of	genes	associated	with	autism	,	such	as	adsl	,	mbd5	,	learning	,	and	tsc1b	.	.
s1554	Peripheral	schwannomas_were	detected	in	3	anatomical_structure_morphogenesis	-	mutant	(	60	%	)	and	10	SMARCB1-mutant	subjects	(	66.7	%	)	.	.
s1017	Over	the	last	5	years	,	several	single	gene	disorders	of	the	autophagy	pathway	have	emerged	,	EPG5-associated	Vici	syndrome	,	WDR45-associated	b	-	propeller	protein	-	associated	neurodegeneration	,	SNX14-associated	autosomal	-	recessive	spinocerebellar	ataxia_20	,	ATG5-associated	autosomal	-	recessive	ataxia	syndrome	,	endosome_organization	/	p62-associated	childhood	-	onset	neurodegeneration	,	and	several	forms	of	the	hereditary	spastic	paraplegias	.	.
s3746	Hearing	impairment	(	potassium_ion_transport	)	is	genetically	heterogeneous_which	hampers	genetic	counseling	and	molecular	diagnosis	.	.
s3197	Atypical	teratoid	/	rhabdoid	tumors	(	AT	/	RT	)	and	renal	/	extrarenal	malignant	rhabdoid	tumors	of	childhood	,	epithelioid	sarcoma	and	small	cell	carcinoma	of	the	ovary	,	hypercalcemic	type	(	SCCOHT	)	represent	the	most	commonly	recognized	chromatin_remodeling	/	SNF	-	driven	neoplasms	.	.
s1790	Although	some	recent	studies	suggest	that	the	obesity	-	related	SNPs	in	FTO	influence	obesity	susceptibility	likely	through	altering	the	expression	of	the	adjacent	genes	such	as	energy_homeostasis_and	RrelationIP1L	,	rather	than	FTO	itself	,	a	solid	link	between	the	SNP	risk	genotype	and	the	increased	FTO	expression	in	both	human	blood	cells	and	fibroblasts	has	been	reported	.	.
s2484	Aberrant	extracellular_matrix_organization_expression	has	been	associated	with	kidney	fibrosis	,	cancer	,	congenital	eye	defects	and	various	cardiovascular	disorders	.	.
s2145	The	second	most	frequently	mutated	gene	,	histone	methyltransferase	regulation_of_double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination	,	has	known	roles	in	multiple	cancers	,	but	has	not	previously	been	strongly	implicated	in	osteosarcoma	.	.
s1068	Through	immunohistochemistry	,	we	found	that	biological_process_protein	expression	correlated	with	Ras	and	EGFR	mutation	status	in	human	lung_adenocarcinoma	.	.
s1908	p16	is	an	important	tumor_suppressor	gene	encoded	by	the	INK4A	/	ARF	/	regulation_of_cyclin	-	dependent_protein_serine	/	threonine_kinase_activity_gene	locus	that	is	conserved	in	humans	,	rodents	,	and	canids	.	.
s2539	These	findings	support	response_to_hypoxia_as	a	dynamic	inhibitory	checkpoint	of	the	potent	activating	receptor	CD16A	,	which	can	be	targeted	by	MEDI3622	to	potentially	increase	the	efficacy	of	anti	-	tumor_therapeutic	antibodies	.
s3029	The	activation_of_innate_immune_response_gene	is	mutated	in	a	form	of	distal	myopathy_and	amyotrophic	lateral	sclerosis	(	ALS	)	.	.
s3796	In	the	eyes	of	Rdh8-/-	phospholipid_translocation-/-	mice	,	a	mouse	model	with	defects	in	retinoid	cycle	that	displays	some	symbolic	characteristics	of	age	-	related	macular_degeneration_(AMD	)	,	the	level	of	atRAL	-	dimer	was	increased	compared	to	wild	-	type	mice	,	and	was	even	much	greater	than	that	of	A2E	AAAAA	isomers	.	.
s2312	Higher	gene	expression	of	the	inositol	1,4,5-trisphosphate	receptor	2	gene	(	response_to_hypoxia	)	,	encoding	the	IP3	receptor	2	(	IP3R2	)	,	was	detected	in	sporadic_ALS	patients	.	.
s1854	We	found	that	LGR5	expression	in	the	epithelium	and	stroma	was	associated	with	tumor_stage	,	and	by	integrating	functional	experiments	with	LGR5-sorted	cell	RNA	sequencing	data	from	adenoma	and	normal	organoids	,	we	found	correlations	between	LGR5	and	CRC	-	specific	genes	,	including	dickkopf	WNT	signaling	pathway	inhibitor	4	(	negative_regulation_of_canonical_Wnt_signaling_pathway	)	and	SPARC	-	related	modular	calcium	binding	2	(	SMOC2	)	.	.
s2311	melanosome_assembly-5	therefore	appears	as	a	mild	form	of	HPS	,	which	is	often	clinically	undistinguishable	from	mild	oculocutaneous	or	ocular	forms	of	albinism	.	.
s3088	Brown	-	Vialetto	-	glycoprotein_biosynthetic_process_Laere	syndrome	represents	a	phenotypic	spectrum	of	motor	,	sensory	,	and	cranial	nerve	neuropathy	,	often	with	ataxia	,	optic_atrophy_and	respiratory	problems	leading	to	ventilator	-	dependence	.	.
s3537	In	subgroup	analysis	,	compared	with	PD	patients	with	initial	symptom	of	tremor	and	HCs	,	the	minor	allele	frequency	of	ribosomal_large_subunit_export_from_nucleus_rs34016896	in	PD	patients	with	initial	symptoms	of	rigidity	/	bradykinesia_was	significantly	lower	.	.
s493	In	this	study	,	we	sequenced	112	patients	with	phenotypes	within	the	epilepsy	-	aphasia	spectrum	(	EAS	)	to	determine	the	frequency	of	CNKSR2	mutation	within	this	complex	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_of	disorders	.	.
s1689	Together	,	our	data	provide	new	evidence	for	the	opposing	effects	of	the	miRNA_catabolic_process	-	IMP1	axis	on	post	-	transcriptional	regulation	of	canonical	WNT	signaling	,	with	implications	in	intestinal	homeostasis	,	regeneration	and	tumorigenesis	.
s2963	Biallelic	pathogenic	variants	in	ubiquitin	-	dependent_protein_catabolic_process_are	associated	with	an	encephalopathic	mtDNA	maintenance	defect	syndrome	that	is	a	multisystem	disease	characterized	by	lactic_acidemia	,	developmental	delay	,	and	hypotonia	.	.
s648	Changes	in	methylation	of	protein_polyubiquitination-193a	or	expression	of	pri	-	miR-193a	were	not	observed	in	ulcerative	colitis	cancer	.	.
s3215	However	,	little	is	known	about	the	effects	of	protein_phosphorylation_in	hepatocellular_carcinoma_(HCC	)	metastasis	and	the	underlying	mechanism	.	.
s204	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal	recessive	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	purine_ribonucleotide_catabolic_process_and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy_(SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s2316	BACKGROUND	Previous	research	found	that	dolichol	-	linked_oligosaccharide_biosynthetic_process_is	associated	with	cervical	cancer	,	but	the	role	of	ALG3	in	breast	cancer	was	still	unknown	.	.
s2232	The	musculo	-	aponeurotic	fibrosarcoma_oncogene	homolog	B	(	MAFB	)	significantly	enhanced	the	activation	of	the	blood_coagulation_promoter	via	RARAAAAAalpha	,	while	MAFF	inhibited	it	.	.
s1133	Cold	-	induced	sweating	syndrome	(	CISS	)	is	a	rare	autosomal_recessive_disease	due	to	mutation	in	the	Cytokine	receptor	-	like	factor	1	(	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation	)	.	.
s485	Recently	,	mutations	in	biological_process_were	reported	in	two	maternal	half	-	brothers	,	presenting	with	nephrocalcinosis	,	midface_hypoplasia_and	,	in	one	of	the	siblings	,	deafness	and	elliptocytosis	.	.
s2673	Interventions	on	cytoskeletal_anchoring_at_plasma_membrane	-	related	diseases	require	prenatal	surveillance	by	sonography	,	gene	testing	in	high	-	risk	carriers	,	and	proper	orthosis	or	orthopedic	surgeries	to	correct	malformations	including	scoliosis	,	cervical	spine	instability	,	large	joint	dislocation	,	and	clubfoot	.	.
s1014	Over	the	last	5	years	,	several	single	gene	disorders	of	the	autophagy	pathway	have	emerged	,	EPG5-associated	Vici	syndrome	,	cellular_response_to_starvation	-	associated	b	-	propeller	protein	-	associated	neurodegeneration	,	SNX14-associated	autosomal	-	recessive	spinocerebellar	ataxia_20	,	ATG5-associated	autosomal	-	recessive	ataxia	syndrome	,	SQSTM1/p62-associated	childhood	-	onset	neurodegeneration	,	and	several	forms	of	the	hereditary	spastic	paraplegias	.	.
s2520	Among	the	44	cases	of	gastritis	/	hyperplasia	,	two	cases	(	4.5	%	)	were	diagnosed	as	cellular_amino_acid_metabolic_process_and	11	cases	(	25.0	%	)	were	diagnosed	as	cancer_after	resection	.	.
s987	RT	-	PCR	analysis	showed	that	the	overall	transcriptional	activity	of	the	main	HS	biosynthesis	-	involved	genes	(	EXT1	,	EXT2	,	heparan_sulfate_proteoglycan_biosynthetic_process	,	NDST2	,	GLCE	,	HS2ST1	,	HS3ST1	,	HS3ST2	,	HS6ST1	,	HS6ST2	,	SULF1	,	SULF2	,	HPSE	)	was	decreased	by	1.5	-	2-fold	in	Grade	II	-	III	glioma	(	p	AAAA	0.01	)	and	by	3-fold	in	Grade	IV	glioma	(	glioblastoma	multiforme	,	GBM	)	(	p	AAAA	0.05	)	,	as	compared	with	the	para	-	tumourous	tissue	.	.
s2354	Using	whole	-	exome	sequencing	,	we	identified	compound	heterozygous	positive_regulation_of_mitochondrial_translation_variants	in	a	4-year	-	old	patient	with	congenital	lactic	acidosis	,	severe	myopathy	,	hearing	loss	,	renal_failure	,	and	dysautonomia	.	.
s3528	In	recent	years	,	many	studies	have	shown	that	intrinsic_apoptotic_signaling_pathway_in_response_to_oxidative_stress	/	DIABLO	is	closely	related	to	tumor_drug	resistance	.	.
s3876	resolution_of_meiotic_recombination_intermediates_is	a	DNA	-	damage	response	gene	whose	heterozygous	mutations	predispose	to	breast	cancer	.	.
s1849	This	bioinformatics	analysis	demonstrated	that	stage	-	related	prognostic	DEGs	,	such	as	COL3A1	,	positive_regulation_of_epithelial_to_mesenchymal_transition	,	COL1A2	,	KRAS	,	and	NRAS	might	play	an	unfavorable	role	in	the	development	as	well	as	metastasis	of	ovarian	cancer	.	.
s2269	A	preliminary	bioinformatics	analysis	showed	that	HOXB1	is	ectopically	expressed	in	glioma	,	and	that	HOXB1	is	a	possible	target	of	protein_polyubiquitination-3175	.	.
s256	Finally	,	in	diffuse	-	type	gastric	cancer	,	anaphase	-	promoting_complex	-	dependent_catabolic_process_mutation	was	found	to	be	associated	with	shortened	patient	survival	,	independently	of	disease	staging	.	.
s997	We	show	that	hypermethylation	of	p16/G1/S_transition_of_mitotic_cell_cycle_and	p19/Arf	in	CNT-	and	asbestos	-	induced	inflammatory	lesions	precedes	mesothelioma	,	this	results	in	silencing	of	Cdkn2a	(	Ink4a	/	Arf	)	and	loss	of	p16	and	p19	protein	,	consistent	with	epigenetic	alterations	playing	a	gatekeeper	role	in	cancer	.	.
s1271	Occurring	in	the	sinonasal	area	of	middle	-	aged	patients	,	SNS	is	a	locally	aggressive	tumor_harboring	in	90	%	of	cases	recurrent	gene	fusions	involving	the	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_gene	,	in	which	the	chimeric	transcription	factor	induces	an	aberrant	dual	myogenic	and	neural	phenotype	.	.
s1397	This	chapter	focuses	on	the	current	data	covering	the	etiology	and	epidemiology	,	clinical	presentation	,	and	pathogenesis	of	four	monogenic	forms	of	isolated	dystonia	,	DYT	-	TOR1A	,	DYT	-	THAP1	,	DYT	-	tetrahydrobiopterin_biosynthetic_process	,	and	DYT	-	GNAL	.
s3170	Currently	,	21	genes	(	BBS1	-	21	)	present	on	different	chromosomes	have	been	mapped	,	these	genes	are	responsible	for	visual_perception_phenotypes	and	they	show	a	great	heterogeneity_of	mutations	.	The	most	common	genes	are	BBS1	(	locus	11q13	)	and	BBS10.We	show	here	the	case	of	a	50	year	old	patient	with	BBS	.	.
s2322	We	screened	the	nucleotide	degrading	enzyme	gene	expression	in	RNAseq	data	of	14	cancer_types	derived	from	The	Cancer	Genome	Atlas	(	TCGA	)	and	found	that	mismatch_repair_overexpression	was	associated	with	poor	patient	survival	only	in	renal	cell	carcinomas	(	RCCs	)	.	.
s3183	The	esophagorespiratory	fistula(protein_methylation)is	a	fatal	complication	ofesophageal	cancer	,	because	ofadvanced	oncological	status	and	poor	conditions	due	to	pneumonia	and/or	malnutrition	.	We	report	here	a	case	of	patient	who	was	successfully	treated	for	esophageal	cancer	with	ERF	with	multimodality	therapy	including	three	-	stage	operation	.	.
s2521	Among	the	182	cases	of	low	-	grade	dysplasia	,	33	cases	(	18.1	%	)	were	diagnosed	as	cellular_amino_acid_metabolic_process_and	nine	cases	(	5.0	%	)	were	diagnosed	as	cancer_after	resection	.	.
s2502	CHD	proteins	play	an	important	role	in	neurodevelopment	,	as	pathogenic	variants	in	CHD1	,	muscle_organ_development	,	CHD4	,	CHD7	and	CHD8	have	been	associated	with	a	range	of	neurological	phenotypes	,	including	autism	spectrum	disorder	(	ASD	)	,	intellectual	disability	(	ID	)	and	epilepsy	.	.
s551	Recent	GWAS	completed	for	three	types	of	common	adult	-	onset	glaucoma_have	identified	novel	loci	for	POAG	(	primary	-	open	-	angle	glaucoma	)	(	ABCA1	,	AFAP1	,	GDP	-	mannose_metabolic_process	,	PMM2	,	TGFBR3	,	FNDC3B	,	ARHGEF12	,	GAS7	,	FOXC1	,	ATXN2	,	TXNRD2	)	,	PACG	(	primary	angle	-	closure	glaucoma	(	EPDR1	,	CHAT	,	GLIS3	,	FERMT2	,	DPM2-FAM102	)	,	and	exfoliation	syndrome	(	XFS	)	glaucoma	(	CACNA1A	)	.	.
s1010	These	findings	indicate	that	the	miR-587/PPP2R1B	/	pAKT	/	positive_regulation_of_protein_ubiquitination_signaling	axis	has	an	important	role	in	mediating	response	to	chemotherapy	in	colorectal	cancer	.	.
s4064	Mutations	in	peripherin	2	(	PRPH2	)	,	also	known	as	retinal_degeneration_slow	/	cell_surface_receptor_signaling_pathway	,	lead	to	various	retinal	degenerations	including	retinitis	pigmentosa	(	RP	)	and	macular	/	pattern	dystrophy	(	MD	/	PD	)	.	.
s934	Recent	research	published	in	the	Journal	of	Pathology	showed	that	genetic	depletion	of	any	of	the	NOX2	subunits	Cyba	,	Cybb	,	Ncf1	,	superoxide_metabolic_process_and	Ncf4	reduced	the	formation	of	lung	metastases	following	intravenous	injection	of	murine	tumor_cells	.	.
s363	Using	a	transgenic	approach	,	we	demonstrate	that	a	594	bp	sequence	encompassing	the	ECR	recapitulates	specific	aspects	of	the	endogenous	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_lateral_facial	expression	pattern	.	.
s844	In	humans	,	phosphorylation_mutations	cause	widespread	retinal_degeneration	,	early	dysfunction	and	loss	of	rod	and	cone	photoreceptors	in	the	outer	retina	and	,	progressively	,	death	of	cells	in	the	inner	retina	.	.
s1672	Mutations	in	KIF1C	are	responsible	for	autosomal_recessive_spastic	paraplegia	type	58	(	SPG58	)	and	spastic	ataxia	2	(	anterograde_neuronal_dense_core_vesicle_transport	)	.	.
s2553	Expectedly	,	the	analysis	of	the	DEGs	common	to	all	three	alterations	highlighted	a	group	of	BioFunctions	that	included	Cell	Proliferation	of	tumor_cell	lines	(	14	DEGs	)	,	Invasion	of	cells	(	10	DEGs	)	and	Migration	of	tumour	cell	lines	(	10	DEGs	)	,	with	a	common	core	of	5	genes	(	ATF3	,	CDKN1A	,	activation_of_MAPK_activity	,	HBEGF	and	LCN2	)	that	likely	represent	downstream	effectors	of	the	pro	-	oncogenic	activities	of	PI3K	/	AKT	signalling	.	.
s492	In	this	study	,	we	sequenced	112	patients	with	phenotypes	within	the	epilepsy	-	aphasia	spectrum	(	EAS	)	to	determine	the	frequency	of	regulation_of_signal_transduction_mutation	within	this	complex	set	of	disorders	.	.
s3408	Synovial	sarcoma_(SS	)	is	genetically	characterized	by	chromosomal	translocation	,	which	generates	SYT	-	regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_fusion	transcripts	.	.
s292	TRN	-	restricted	deletion	of	smoothened_signaling_pathway_leads	to	attention	deficits	and	hyperactivity	,	both	of	which	are	rescued	by	pharmacological	augmentation	of	SK	channel	activity	.	.
s3188	The	tumor_was	diagnosed	ACC	with	immunohistochemistry	,	positive	to	ACC	phenotype(DNA_clamp_unloading	-	antitrypsin	,	a1-antichymotrypsin	,	BCL10	)	.	.
s2827	We	detected	11	novel	mutations	in	GJA3	,	GJA8	,	negative_regulation_of_intracellular_transport	,	CRYBB2	,	CRYGS	,	CRYGA	,	GCNT2	,	CRYGA	,	and	MIP	,	and	three	previously	reported	cataract	-	causing	mutations	in	GJA8	,	CRYAA	,	and	CRYBB2	The	most	commonly	mutated	genes	were	those	coding	for	gap	junctions	and	crystallin	proteins	.	.
s3936	We	suggest	that	the	combination	of	reduced	NM23-H1	,	induced	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	and	the	presence	of	tumor_budding	are	promising	biomarkers	for	the	prediction	of	recurrence	and	may	aid	the	stratification	of	patients	with	stage	II	colon	cancer	for	adjuvant	chemotherapy	.
s3064	Our	data	implicate	rare	variants	in	the	AGS	genes	adenosine_to_inosine_editing_and	RNASEH2B	and	a	type	I	interferon	signature	in	glioma_and	prostate	carcinoma	risk	and	tumorigenesis	,	consistent	with	a	genetic	basis	underlying	inflammation	-	driven	malignant	transformation	in	glioma	and	prostate	carcinoma	development	.
s444	Regarding	DNA	methylation	,	all	four	SMARCB1/INI1-deficient	tumors	showed	methylation	of	Ras_protein_signal_transduction_gene	by	means	of	MS	-	MLPA	.	.
s874	Metabolic	cutis	laxa	results	from	Menkes	syndrome	,	caused	by	a	defect	in	the	ATPase	copper	transporting	alpha	(	ATP7A	)	gene	,	congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	due	to	mutations	in	subunit	7	of	the	component	of	oligomeric	Golgi	(	COG7)-congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	(	CDG	)	complex	,	combined	disorder	of	N-	and	O	-	linked	glycosylation	,	due	to	mutations	in	ATPase	H+	transporting	V0	subunit	a2	(	ATP6VOA2	)	gene	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	reductase	1	deficiency	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	synthase	deficiency	,	macrocephaly	,	alopecia	,	cutis	laxa	,	and	scoliosis_(MACS	)	syndrome	,	due	to	Ras	and	Rab	interactor	2	(	RIN2	)	mutations	,	transaldolase	deficiency	caused	by	mutations	in	the	transaldolase	1	(	TALDO1	)	gene	,	Gerodermia	osteodysplastica	due	to	mutations	in	the	golgin	,	RAB6-interacting	(	GORAB	or	SCYL1BP1	)	gene	,	and	mitogen	-	activated	pathway	(	MAP	)	kinase	defects	,	caused	by	mutations	in	several	genes	[	protein	tyrosine	phosphatase	,	non	-	receptor	-	type	11	(	PTPN11	)	,	RAF	,	NF	,	HRas	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	HRAS	)	,	B	-	Raf	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	BRAF	)	,	MEK1/2	,	KRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	KRAS	)	,	SOS	Ras	/	G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway_guanine	nucleotide	exchange	factor	2	(	SOS2	)	,	leucine	rich	repeat	scaffold	protein	(	SHOC2	)	,	NRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	NRAS	)	,	and	Raf-1	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	RAF1	)	]	,	which	regulate	the	Ras	-	MAPK	cascade	.	.
s752	Compared	with	the	AA	genotype	,	amino	-	acid_betaine_metabolic_process_(rs492842	and	rs542852	)	GG	and	AG	genotypes	were	associated	with	twice	the	riskof	congenital_heart_defects_(BFDP=0.74	and	0.79	,	respectively	)	.	.
s85	In	Mfrprd6	eyes	,	a	significant	1.5-	to	2.0-fold	decrease	was	observed	among	transcripts	of	genes	linked	to	retinal_degeneration	,	including	those	involved	in	visual	cycle	(	Rpe65	,	Lrat	,	Rgr	)	,	phototransduction	(	Pde6a	,	Guca1b	,	Rgs9	)	,	and	photoreceptor	disc	morphogenesis	(	visual_perception_and	Fscn2	)	.	.
s1300	Although	MPC	is	composed	of	two	subunits	,	it	has	been	reported	that	the	mitochondrial_pyruvate_transmembrane_transport_subunit	is	specifically	associated	with	poor	prognosis	in	several	cancers	,	including	colorectal	and	prostate	cancer	.	.
s1004	Knockdown	of	apoptotic_process_involved_in_morphogenesis_expression	increases	AKT	phosphorylation	,	which	leads	to	elevated	XIAP	expression	and	enhanced	5-FU	resistance	,	whereas	rescue	of	PPP2R1B	expression	in	miR-587-expressing	cells	decreases	AKT	phosphorylation	/	XIAP	expression	,	re	-	sensitizing	colon	cancer_cells	to	5-FU	-	induced	apoptosis	.	.
s1876	In	vitro	analysis	revealed	that	knockdown	of	WWOX	protein	in	neuroblastoma_cells	results	in	aggregation	of	TRAPPC6AD	,	I	-	kappaB_kinase	/	NF	-	kappaB_signaling	,	amyloid	b	,	and	Tau	in	a	sequential	manner	.	.
s998	We	show	that	hypermethylation	of	p16/Ink4a	and	positive_regulation_of_defense_response_to_virus_by_host	/	Arf	in	CNT-	and	asbestos	-	induced	inflammatory	lesions	precedes	mesothelioma	,	this	results	in	silencing	of	Cdkn2a	(	Ink4a	/	Arf	)	and	loss	of	p16	and	p19	protein	,	consistent	with	epigenetic	alterations	playing	a	gatekeeper	role	in	cancer	.	.
s2039	Therefore	,	it	seems	plausible	that	mutations	in	biological_process_are	associated	with	a	different	(	novel	)	subtype	of	SCD	mainly	characterized	by	severe	rib_anomalies_but	lacking	clear	segmentation	defects	of	the	vertebral	bodies	.
s2707	The	chromosome	22	disorder	,	due	to	mutations	in	the	nuclear	gene	pyrimidine_nucleoside_metabolic_process_encoding	thymidine	phosphorylase	(	TP	)	,	leads	to	the	accumulation	of	thymidine	and	deoxyuridine	,	with	mitochondrial	dysfunction	.	This	report	describes	a	patient	with	an	MNGIE	-	like	syndrome	with	a	heterozygous	TYMP	mutation	who	showed	marked	,	but	transient	improvement	postallogeneic	haematopoietic	stem	cell	transplantation	(	HSCT).The	patient	,	showing	ptosis_and	ophthalmoplegia	,	was	initially	managed	for	myasthenia	gravis	.	.
s3448	In	addition	,	the	analysis	of	upstream	protein_polyubiquitinationNAs	showed	that	FOXF1	adjacent	non	-	coding	developmental	regulatory	RNA	(	FENDRR	)	had	common	upstream	miRNAs	,	including	miR-18b-5p	,	with	another	119	differentially	expressed	genes	,	and	that	FENDRR	was	co	-	expressed	with	adenomatosis	polyposis	coli	downregulated	1	(	APCDD1	)	and	v	-	kit	Hardy	-	Zuckerman	4	feline	sarcoma_viral	oncogene	homolog	(	KIT	)	.	.
s1774	Some	genes	,	such	as	glutathione_metabolic_process	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s2151	Interestingly	,	GTP_metabolic_process_null	allele	homozygosity	in	humans	is	not	lethal	,	but	instead	causes	the	developmental	disorder	Carpenter	s	syndrome	(	CS	)	,	which	is	characterized	by	craniofacial	malformations	,	polysyndactyly	,	obesity	and	intellectual_disability	.	.
s2770	Increased	RAD6	levels	cause	histone	2B	ubiquitination	-	mediated	epigenetic	changes	that	stimulate	transcription	of	stem	cell	genes	,	including	oxidation	-	reduction_process_and	SOX2	,	leading	to	a	cancer_stem	cell	phenotype	,	which	is	implicated	in	disease	recurrence	and	metastasis	.	.
s1753	Serine	and	ribose	synthesis	have	been	identified	as	downstream	pathways	fed	by	pyruvate_metabolic_process_in	cancer_cells	.	.
s1434	cellular_response_to_epidermal_growth_factor_stimulus_and	EEF1A2	,	in	most	of	the	cancer_types	.	.
s1801	These	results	demonstrated	the	existence	of	a	DNA_strand_renaturation	-	independent	mechanism	that	links	cell	growth	to	cell	proliferation	in	mammalian	cells	,	and	suggested	that	selective	targeting	of	the	RNA	polymerase	I	transcription	machinery	might	be	advisable	to	hinder	proliferation	of	p53-deficient	cancer_cells	.
s2197	In	addition	,	the	results	indicated	that	USP18	may	promote	the	epidermal	growth	factor	(	EGF)-mediated	EGF	receptor	(	EGFR)/AKT	/	S	-	phase	kinase	-	associated	protein	2	(	regulation_of_apoptotic_process	)	pathway	by	upregulating	EGFR	and	Skp2	in	a	AKT	/	forkhead	box	O3-dependent	manner	in	breast	cancer	.	.
s3463	Gene	set	enrichment	analysis	was	conducted	to	study	the	relevant	mechanisms	.	Bladder	cancer	patients	in	negative_regulation_of_endodermal_cell_differentiation_low	expression	group	were	associated	with	better	invasiveness	(	P	AAAA	.0001	)	,	tumor_grade	(	P	=	.001	)	,	T	staging	(	P	AAAA	.0001	)	,	N	staging	(	P	=	.002	)	,	cancer	specific	survival	(	P	AAAA	.0001	)	,	overall	survival	(	P	AAAA	.0001	)	,	and	a	trend	of	better	M	staging	(	P	=	.053	)	than	those	in	COL5A2	high	expression	group	.	COL5A2	might	affect	the	progression	of	bladder	cancer	through	AAAAAACoagulation	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAHypoxia	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAApical	junction	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAUltraviolet	response	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAEpithelial	mesenchymal	transition	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAAngiogenesis	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAKRAS	(	KRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	)	signaling	,	AAAAAAComplement	,	AAAAAAIL2-STAT5-signaling	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAInflammatory	response	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAIL6-JAK	-	STAT3-signaling	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAMyogenesis	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAATNF	a	signaling	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAApoptosis	,	AAAAAA	and	AAAAAAHedgehog	-	signaling	.	AAAAA	,	Our	results	demonstrated	that	COL5A2	was	correlated	with	poor	clinical	outcomes	and	survivals	of	patients	with	bladder	cancer	,	suggesting	that	it	could	be	regarded	as	a	biomarker	of	bladder	cancer	.
s2224	We	previously	demonstrated	that	phospho	-	mTOR	expression	is	associated	with	tumor_aggressiveness	,	therapy	resistance	,	and	lower	mRNA	expression	of	SLC5A5	in	papillary	thyroid	carcinoma	(	PTC	)	,	while	phospho	-	positive_regulation_of_RNA_polymerase_II_transcriptional_preinitiation_complex_assembly_(mTORC1	effector	)	expression	was	associated	with	less	aggressive	clinicopathological	features	.	.
s3274	Expression	of	fat_cell_differentiation_as	well	as	Ki-67	was	higher	in	glioma_tissues	demonstrated	by	western	blot	and	immunohistochemistry	.	.
s3357	We	found	that	LGR5	expression	in	the	epithelium	and	stroma	was	associated	with	tumor_stage	,	and	by	integrating	functional	experiments	with	LGR5-sorted	cell	RNA	sequencing	data	from	adenoma	and	normal	organoids	,	we	found	correlations	between	LGR5	and	CRC	-	specific	genes	,	including	dickkopf	WNT	signaling	pathway	inhibitor	4	(	DKK4	)	and	negative_regulation_of_endothelial_cell_proliferation	-	related	modular	calcium	binding	2	(	SMOC2	)	.	.
s1947	The	results	suggest	a	conditional	regulation	of	aging_gene	by	ATF4	that	may	be	inhibited	in	normal	cells	,	but	engaged	during	cancer_progression	.	.
s1182	In	conclusion	,	the	present	results	suggested	that	positive_regulation_of_vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_production_and	LYVE1	may	have	potential	as	biomarkers	for	the	identification	of	lung	cancer_patients	at	a	high	risk	of	LNM	.
s1007	Importantly	,	studies	of	colorectal	cancer_specimens	indicate	that	the	expression	of	miR-587	and	apoptotic_process_involved_in_morphogenesis_positively	and	inversely	correlates	with	chemoresistance	,	respectively	,	in	colorectal	cancer	.	.
s1480	However	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_downstream	targets	in	neurons	,	and	the	mechanism	via	which	it	causes	dystonia_are	largely	unknown	.	.
s3102	Mutations	of	the	five	genes	(	ARHGEF5	,	ANKRD20A2	,	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	ZNF812	,	MYO18B	)	may	be	potential	germline	mutations	of	lung	cancer	.	.
s3143	At	the	suggestive	threshold	(	P	AAAA	.001	)	,	6	genes	were	enriched	for	rare	damaging	variants	(	UHMK1	,	AP1G2	,	DNTA	,	CHST6	,	fibroblast_growth_factor_receptor_signaling_pathway	,	and	EPHA1	)	and	7	genes	had	associations	with	pancreatic	cancer_risk	,	based	on	the	sequence	-	kernel	association	test	.	.
s3468	We	have	previously	identified	a	role	for	the	secreted	serine	protease	camera	-	type_eye_development_in	ocular	size	determination	and	PRSS56	variants	have	been	implicated	in	the	etiology	of	both	hyperopia	and	myopia	,	highlighting	its	importance	in	refractive	development	.	.
s3841	A	founder	mutation	in	positive_regulation_of_GTPase_activity_(KIAA1432	)	was	identified	in	patients	with	cataract	,	brain	atrophy	,	microcephaly	with	or	without	cleft	lip	and	palate	.	.
s1110	Tricho	-	hepato	-	enteric	syndrome	(	SD	/	THE	)	and	Multiple	intestinal_atresia_with	combined	immune	deficiency	(	cell_proliferation	-	CID	)	are	autosomal	recessive	disorders	that	present	immunological	and	gastrointestinal	features	.	.
s1483	The	BARD1	mutations	also	caused	loss	of	transcriptional	repression	of	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination	-	regulated	estrogen	metabolism	genes	CYP1A1	and	CYP3A4	,	breast	epithelial	cells	edited	to	create	heterozygous	loss	of	BARD1	showed	significantly	higher	expression	of	CYP1A1	and	CYP3A4	Reintroduction	of	wild	-	type	BARD1	into	these	cells	restored	CYP1A1	and	CYP3A4	transcription	to	normal	levels	,	but	introduction	of	the	cancer	-	predisposing	BARD1	RING	mutants	failed	to	do	so	.	.
s3312	Mutations	in	peripheral_nervous_system_development_gene	have	been	described	in	relation	to	infantile	onset	epilepsy	with	movement	disorders	and	developmental_delay	.	.
s229	Our	data	,	with	previously	published	reports	,	suggest	that	duplications	involving	SHROOM4	and	response_to_oxidative_stress_may	represent	a	new	syndromic	X	-	linked	ID	critical	region	associated	with	mild	to	severe	ID	,	speech_delay_+/-	dysarthria	,	attention	deficit	disorder	,	precocious	puberty	,	constipation	,	and	motor	delay	.	.
s4039	We	have	developed	a	gene	-	environment	interaction	model	of	holoprosencephaly_in	mice	,	in	which	mutation	of	the	Sonic	hedgehog	coreceptor	,	cell_adhesion	,	synergizes	with	transient	in	utero	exposure	to	ethanol	.	.
s3862	In	A549	lung	cancer_cells	,	which	endogenously	express	CXCR1	,	the	depletion	of	biological_process_and	REEP6	significantly	reduced	growth	and	invasion	by	downregulating	IL-8-stimulated	ERK	phosphorylation	,	actin	polymerization	and	the	expression	of	genes	related	to	metastasis	.	.
s1402	Furthermore	,	we	found	that	tumor_necrosis	factor	(	protein_import_into_nucleus,_translocation	)	receptor	-	associated	factor	5	(	TRAF5	)	and	TGF	-	b	activated	kinase	1	(	MAP3K7	)	binding	protein	1	(	TAB1	)	were	direct	targets	of	miR-873	in	CRC	cells	.	.
s1505	A	replicative	analysis	of	associations	of	15	SNPs	located	in	the	regions	of	11	genes	(	TCF4	,	VRK2	,	NOTCH4	,	ZNF804A	,	AGBL1	,	RELN	,	ZFP64P1	,	potassium_ion_transport	,	CSMD1	,	CPVL	,	NRIP1	)	and	three	intergenic	regions	(	SLCO6A1/LINCOO491	,	LOC105376248/LOC105376249	,	SPA17/NRGN	)	with	schizophrenia_was	conducted	in	the	Russian	population	of	the	Siberian	region	.	.
s840	Oncogenic	phosphorylation_mutations	are	found	in	a	significant	fraction	of	human	cancers	,	but	therapeutic	inhibition	of	PI3	K	has	only	shown	limited	success	in	clinical	trials	.	.
s337	The	chemical_synaptic_transmission_gene	was	first	analysed	,	revealing	homozygous	or	compound	heterozygous	mutations	in	30/97	(	30.9	%	)	of	probands	,	the	largest	SPG11	series	reported	to	date	,	and	by	far	the	most	common	cause	of	complex	spastic_paraplegia_in	the	UK	,	with	severe	and	progressive	clinical	features	and	other	neurological	manifestations	,	linked	with	magnetic	resonance	imaging	defects	.	.
s326	Taken	all	together	,	these	findings	provide	convincing	evidence	implicating	platelet_aggregation_aberrations	in	the	newly	recognized	overgrowth	syndrome	and	expand	the	associated	phenotypes	to	include	possible	Wilms	tumor_predisposition	.	.
s714	Further	studies	showed	that	protein_K27-linked_ubiquitination_was	closely	associated	with	increased	expression	of	estrogen	receptor	,	a	critical	factor	in	the	development	of	breast	cancers	.	.
s1330	She	manifested	macrocephaly	,	preaxial	polysyndactyly	,	psychomotor	developmental_delay	,	cerebral	cavernous	malformations	,	and	glucose	intolerance	due	to	a	6.2-Mb	deletion	of	7p14.1p12.3	which	included	GLI3	,	GCK	,	and	vasculogenesis	.	.
s2583	Genetic	studies	on	consanguineous	families	with	primary	microcephaly_have	identified	15	(	MCPH	)	causative	genes	that	include	MCPH1	,	WDR62	,	microtubule_cytoskeleton_organization	,	CASC5	,	ASPM	,	CENPJ	,	STIL	,	CEP135	,	CEP152	,	ZNF335	,	PHC1	,	CDK6	,	CENPE	,	SASS6	MFSD2A	ANKLE2	and	CIT	(	Khan	et	al	.	2014	,	Yamamoto	et	al	.	2014	,	Alakbarzade	et	al	.	2015,Morris	-	Rosendahl	and	Kaindl	2015	,	Basit	et	al	.	2016	)	.	.
s3203	However	,	more	recently	,	inherited	SWI	/	SNF	-	deficiency	has	been	linked	to	several	benign	syndromic	tumors	including	a	subset	of	familial	schwannomatosis	(	linked	to	SMARCB1	)	and	multiple	meningiomas	(	linked	to	nucleosome_disassembly	)	as	well	as	others	.	.
s3755	Bartter	syndrome	type	IV	,	characterized	by	salt	-	losing	nephropathies	and	sensorineural	deafness	,	is	caused	by	mutations	of	BSND	or	simultaneous	mutations	of	both	excretion_and	CLCNKB	.	.
s3933	In	contrast	,	the	regulation_of_dopamine_secretion	/	TNNI2	fusion	transcript	resulting	from	transcription	-	induced	chimerism	by	read	-	through	mechanisms	was	a	rather	common	and	tumor	-	specific	event	occurring	in	37.5	%	(	18/48	)	of	the	UC	specimens	.	.
s1196	In	particular	,	MYH9	mutations	result	in	congenital	macrothrombocytopenia_and	predispose	to	kidney	failure	,	hearing	loss	,	and	cataracts	,	MPL	and	MECOM	mutations	cause	congenital	thrombocytopenia	evolving	into	bone	marrow	failure	,	whereas	thrombocytopenias	caused	by	hemopoiesis	,	ANKRD26	,	and	ETV6	mutations	are	characterized	by	predisposition	to	hematological	malignancies	.	.
s1103	In	two	different	patients	with	unilateral	cryptorchidism	,	we	found	the	variants	rs121912556	and	p	.	R105R	of	positive_regulation_of_epithelial_cell_migration_gene	in	a	heterozygous	form	associated	with	cryptorchidism	,	so	we	could	considered	them	as	risk	factors	for	cryptorchidism	.	.
s4000	In	this	study	,	we	generated	GCN2	inhibitors	and	demonstrated	that	inhibition	of	GCN2	sensitizes	cancer_cells	with	low	basal	-	level	expression	of	asparagine	synthetase	(	asparagine_biosynthetic_process	)	to	the	antileukemic	agent	l	-	asparaginase	(	ASNase	)	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	.	.
s1680	The	goal	of	this	study	was	to	isolate	cancer_stem	-	like	cells	marked	by	high	expression	of	hyaluronan_catabolic_process	,	a	putative	cancer	stem	cell	marker	,	from	primary	oral	squamous	cell	carcinomas	and	identify	distinctive	gene	expression	patterns	in	these	cells	.	.
s3371	We	found	that	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_expression	was	cell-	and	anti	-	cancer_agent	-	specific	,	down	-	regulated	in	doxorubicin-	and	docetaxel	-	resistant	MCF7	cells	while	up	-	regulated	in	doxorubicin	-	resistant	HeLa	cells	.	.
s3236	Expression	of	endothelial_cell_morphogenesis	-	signaling	genes	in	human	lymphoblastoid	cells	of	individuals	homozygous	for	p	.	Gly116Glu	GAB1	revealed	dysregulation	of	HGF	,	MET	,	SHP2	,	and	SPRY2	,	all	of	which	have	reported	variants	associated	with	deafness	.	.
s4044	That	binding	,	which	interferes	with	the	interaction	of	RhoA	-	GTP	with	the	G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathwayGAP	domain	,	reduces	the	hydrolysis	of	RhoA	-	GTP	,	the	binding	of	other	DLC1	ligands	,	and	the	colocalization	of	DLC1	with	focal	adhesions	and	attenuates	tumor_suppressor	activity	.	.
s1513	The	present	study	confirmed	associations	of	KCNB2	rs2247572	,	CSMD1	rs2616984	,	and	intergenic	rs12807809	located	in	spermatogenesis	/	NRGN	with	schizophrenia	.	.
s2572	The	DLEC1	,	TUSC4	and	mismatch_repair_expression	was	analysed	in	lung	tumour_tissue	samples	obtained	from	69	patients	diagnosed	with	NSCLC	,	squamous	cell	carcinoma	(	n	=	34	)	,	adenocarcinoma	(	n	=	24	)	,	large	cell	carcinoma	(	n	=	5	)	,	carcinoma	adenosquamosum	(	n	=	5	)	.	.
s3723	The	PCH1sub	-	types	with	early	death	(	between	ages	1	day	and	17	months	)	,	seen	in	patients	with	p	.	G31A	/	rRNA_processing_or	SLC25A46	mutations	have	a	SMA	type	1-like	clinical	presentation	but	with	global	developmental_delay	,	visual	and	hearing	impairment	,	with	or	without	microcephaly	,	nystagmus	and	optic	atrophy	.	.
s1478	These	effects	are	cell	-	type	-	selective	,	cell	-	autonomous	,	and	involve	activation	of	DNA_strand_renaturation_tumour	-	suppressor	protein	.	.
s3500	We	present	the	case	of	a	severe	familial	primary	hyperparathyroidism_related	to	a	germline	deletion	in	the	HRPT2	(	negative_regulation_of_cell_proliferation	)	gene	.	.
s2513	Extensive	search	of	the	literature	revealed	a	potential	key	role	of	genes	at	the	identified	porcine	loci	in	tumor_invasion	(	response_to_wounding	,	PLEKHA5	,	CBY1	,	LIMK2	and	ETV5	)	and	immune	response	modulation	(	ETV5	,	HERC3	and	DICER1	)	of	the	progression	phenotypes	.	.
s3488	In	the	present	study	,	WFS1	variants	were	screened	in	a	large	series	of	Japanese	hearing_loss_(HL	)	patients	to	clarify	the	prevalence	and	clinical	characteristics	of	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II/14/38	and	Wolfram	-	like	syndrome	.	.
s651	IL17RD	expression	was	increased	in	ulcerative	colitis	cancers	,	and	protein_polyubiquitination-193a-3p	treatment	decreased	growth	and	EGFR	signaling	of	HCT116	cells	in	xenografts	expressing	both	IL17RD	with	WT	3	UTR	compared	with	cells	expressing	IL17RD	with	mutant	3	UTR.Conclusions	,	miR-193a-3p	is	downregulated	in	ulcerative	colitis	neoplasia	,	and	its	loss	promotes	carcinogenesis	through	upregulation	of	IL17RD	.	.
s2811	Here	we	report	three	families	with	homozygous	truncating	mutations	in	vesicle_tethering_to_Golgi_who	display	moderate	to	severe	intellectual	disability	and	microcephaly	.	.
s1345	CONCLUSIONS	response_to_calcium_ion_plays	a	critical	role	in	regulating	GC	proliferation	,	migration	,	and	invasion	via	the	AKT	/	GSK-3b	pathway	,	and	can	potentially	be	used	as	a	prognostic	factor	and	therapeutic	target	for	gastric	cancer_patients	.
s3315	Growth	abnormalities	,	motor	dysfunction	,	hindlimb	paralysis	,	muscle_wasting	,	neurogenic	atrophy	,	motor	neuron	degeneration	,	and	loss	of	large	-	caliber	axons	in	peripheral	nerves	occurred	at	an	earlier	age	in	cytoskeleton_organization	/	Scyl3	double	-	deficient	mice	than	in	Scyl1-deficient	mice	.	.
s2080	Four	of	the	five	genes	,	including	AKAP12	,	SOPB	,	TCF7L2	,	COL12A1	and	keratinocyte_differentiation_were	downregulated	,	and	were	associated	with	the	OS	of	patients	with	breast	carcinoma	.	.
s2062	Oncogene	-	induced	senescence	appears	to	decrease	the	frequency	of	the	multistep	progression	in	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation-	or	BRAF	-	mutated	adenocarcinoma	,	whose	tumor_evolution	may	be	associated	with	epigenetic	alterations	and	kinase	-	inactive	mutations	.	.
s1671	Mutations	in	KIF1C	are	responsible	for	autosomal_recessive_spastic	paraplegia	type	58	(	anterograde_neuronal_dense_core_vesicle_transport	)	and	spastic	ataxia	2	(	SPAX2	)	.	.
s1393	Taken	together	,	the	results	indicate	that	increase	of	defense_response_to_virus_content	and	up	-	regulation	of	perlecan	/	HSPG2	expression	in	glioblastoma	tissues	contribute	to	tumour_development	through	the	transformation	of	brain	extracellular	matrix	into	tumour	microenvironment	,	and	represent	negative	prognostic	factors	for	glioblastoma	progression	.
s4053	The	purpose	of	this	review	is	to	present	a	comprehensive	picture	of	the	impact	of	DNA_dealkylation_involved_in_DNA_repair_on	obesity_susceptibility	and	to	illuminate	these	new	studies	of	FTO	function	in	adipose	tissue	.
s1972	L1	cell	adhesion	molecule	(	cell	-	matrix_adhesion	)	is	a	member	of	the	immunoglobulin	-	like	cell	-	adhesion	molecule	family	that	was	shown	to	be	associated	with	a	worse	prognosis	in	several	human	cancers	.	.
s3061	An	increased	ISG	expression	was	also	induced	by	ADAR	and	RNA_catabolic_process_variants	in	tumor_cells	and	was	blocked	by	the	JAK	inhibitor	Ruxolitinib	.	.
s816	In	childhood	tumors	,	including	retinoblastoma	,	osteosarcoma	,	and	neuroblastoma	,	the	regulation_of_lipid_kinase_activity	-	E2F1	pathway	is	inactivated	,	as	a	rule	.	.
s2460	Here	,	we	show	that	the	expression	of	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	a	zinc	finger	factor	involved	in	several	cellular	processes	,	decreases	during	terminal	differentiation	of	murine	cortical	neurons	and	in	retinoic	acid	-	induced	differentiation	of	neuroblastoma_(NB	)	cells	.	.
s2258	Among	the	363	outbreaks	with	a	confirmed	infectious	etiology	,	212	(	58	%	)	were	caused	by	Cryptosporidium	(	which	causes	predominantly	gastrointestinal	illness	)	,	57	(	16	%	)	by	Legionella	(	which	causes	Legionnaires	_	disease	,	a	severe	pneumonia	,	and	Pontiac	fever	,	a	milder	illness	with	flu	-	like	symptoms	)	,	and	47	(	13	%	)	by	Pseudomonas	(	which	causes	folliculitis	[	AAAAAAhot	positive_regulation_of_phagocytosis_rashAAAAAA	]	and	otitis	externa	[	AAAAAAswimmers	_	earAAAAAA	]	)	.	.
s230	Our	data	,	with	previously	published	reports	,	suggest	that	duplications	involving	cell_morphogenesis_and	DGKK	may	represent	a	new	syndromic	X	-	linked	ID	critical	region	associated	with	mild	to	severe	ID	,	speech	delay	+	/-	dysarthria	,	attention	deficit	disorder	,	precocious	puberty	,	constipation	,	and	motor_delay	.	.
s346	In	the	remaining	cases	,	next	generation	sequencing	was	carried	out	revealing	variants	in	a	number	of	other	known	complex	spastic	paraplegia	genes	,	including	five	in	SPG7	(	5/97	)	,	four	in	FA2H	(	also	known	as	SPG35	)	(	4/97	)	and	two	in	ZFYVE26/SPG15	Variants	were	identified	in	genes	usually	associated	with	pure	spastic	paraplegia	and	also	in	the	Parkinson	s	disease	-	associated	gene	cellular_calcium_ion_homeostasis	,	neuronal	ceroid	lipofuscinosis	gene	TPP1	and	the	hereditary	motor	and	sensory	neuropathy_DNMT1	gene	,	highlighting	the	genetic	heterogeneity	of	spastic	paraplegia	.	.
s787	In	two	different	patients	with	unilateral	cryptorchidism	,	we	found	the	variants	rs121912556	and	p	.	R105R	of	positive_regulation_of_epithelial_cell_migration_gene	in	a	heterozygous	form	associated	with	cryptorchidism	,	so	we	could	considered	them	as	risk	factors	for	cryptorchidism	.	.
s1788	Fat	mass	and	obesity	-	associated	protein	(	DNA_dealkylation_involved_in_DNA_repair	)	single	-	nucleotide	polymorphisms	(	SNPs	)	have	been	linked	to	increased	body	mass	and	obesity	in	humans	by	genome	-	wide	association	studies	(	GWAS	)	since	2007	.	.
s2304	Both	the	primary	tumor_and	the	JU	-	negative_regulation_of_endopeptidase_activity_cells	showed	nuclear	expression	of	the	TFE3	transcription	factor	but	TFE3-activating	chromosomal	rearrangements	were	not	found	.	.
s928	Moreover	,	the	Kaplan	-	Meier	survival	analysis	was	performed	using	homologenes	(	MST1R	,	PIK3CB	and	protein_phosphorylation	)	of	hub	genes	in	human	to	evaluate	whether	exposure	to	bisphenols	may	adversely	affect	breast	cancer	.	.
s3373	Our	patient	had	all	the	major	characteristic	features	consistent	with	Ellis	-	glycoprotein_biosynthetic_process_Creveld	syndrome	including	post	-	axial	polydactyly	,	teeth	and	nail	abnormalities	,	congenital	heart	defect	and	skeletal	dysplasia	.	.
s2987	WTX	/	positive_regulation_of_protein_ubiquitination_is	an	important	developmental	regulator	,	mutations	in	which	have	been	identified	in	a	proportion	of	patients	suffering	from	the	renal	neoplasm	Wilms	_	tumor_and	in	the	bone	malformation	syndrome	Osteopathia	Striata	with	Cranial	Sclerosis	(	OSCS	)	.	.
s3345	Mutations	in	autophagosome_membrane_docking_gene	result	in	CEDNIK	(	Cerebral	dysgenesis	,	neuropathy	,	ichthyosis	and	palmoplantar	keratoderma	)	syndrome	.	.
s2609	The	expression	of	the	ID2	,	PRELP	and	positive_regulation_of_endothelial_cell_migration_genes	was	compared	between	the	endometrium	of	women	without	endometriosis_in	the	proliferative	phase	of	their	menstrual	cycle	and	the	eutopic	and	ectopic	endometrium	of	women	with	endometriosis	in	the	proliferative	phase	.	.
s298	Bardet	Biedl	syndrome	(	visual_perception	)	is	a	multisystem	genetically	heterogeneous	ciliopathy	that	most	commonly	leads	to	obesity	,	photoreceptor	degeneration	,	digit	anomalies	,	genito	-	urinary	abnormalities	,	as	well	as	cognitive	impairment	with	autism	,	among	other	features	.	.
s3626	fructose_2,6-bisphosphate_metabolic_process_and	phosphorylated	SRC-3	levels	are	increased	and	correlate	in	oestrogen	receptor	-	positive	tumours	,	whereas	,	in	patients	with	the	basal	subtype	,	PFKFB4	and	SRC-3	drive	a	common	protein	signature	that	correlates	with	the	poor	survival	of	patients	with	breast	cancer	.	.
s426	Our	results	suggest	that	HOX	genes	may	play	a	more	important	role	in	progression	of	glioma_when	photoreceptor_cell_maintenance_expression	is	low	.	.
s1493	This	study	aims	to	determine	the	association	between	activation_of_MAPK_activity_(rs4415084	CAAAAT	)	,	FGFR2	(	rs2981582	CAAAAT	)	and	MAP3K1	(	rs889312	AAAAAC	)	gene	polymorphisms	and	breast	cancer	,	to	analyse	the	discriminative	ability	of	each	SNP	and	to	test	the	accuracy	of	the	predictive	breast	cancer	risk	model	which	includes	all	SNPs	.	.
s1588	In	both	settings	,	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_transactivates	insulin	-	like	growth	factor	2	(	IGF2	)	,	a	key	Wilms	tumor_oncogene	,	and	drives	mammalian	target	of	rapamycin	complex	1	(	mTORC1	)	signaling	.	.
s2407	Moreover	,	drug	sensitivity	analysis	and	the	Cancer	Cell	Line	Encyclopedia	database	revealed	that	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation	-	deficient	cells	had	high	sensitivity	to	a	YAP	inhibitor	and	to	two	other	anticancer_drugs	(	PHA-665752	,	PF2341066	)	.	.
s356	We	describe	a	neurological	disorder	with	epilepsy_and	prominent	choreoathetosis	caused	by	biallelic	pathogenic	variants	in	regulation_of_glutamate_receptor_signaling_pathway	,	which	encodes	an	AMPA	receptor	outer	-	core	protein	.	.
s2582	Genetic	studies	on	consanguineous	families	with	primary	microcephaly_have	identified	15	(	MCPH	)	causative	genes	that	include	MCPH1	,	mitotic_spindle_organization	,	CDK5RAP2	,	CASC5	,	ASPM	,	CENPJ	,	STIL	,	CEP135	,	CEP152	,	ZNF335	,	PHC1	,	CDK6	,	CENPE	,	SASS6	MFSD2A	ANKLE2	and	CIT	(	Khan	et	al	.	2014	,	Yamamoto	et	al	.	2014	,	Alakbarzade	et	al	.	2015,Morris	-	Rosendahl	and	Kaindl	2015	,	Basit	et	al	.	2016	)	.	.
s2506	Pathogenic	variants	in	muscle_organ_development_are	associated	with	developmental	epileptic	encephalopathy_(DEE	)	in	humans	,	however	little	is	known	about	how	these	variants	contribute	to	this	disorder	.	.
s316	Only	four	genetic	midfrequency	deafness_genes	,	namely	,	DFNA10	(	EYA4	)	,	cell	-	matrix_adhesion/12	(	TECTA	)	,	DFNA13	(	COL11A2	)	,	DFNA44	(	CCDC50	)	,	have	been	reported	to	date	.	.
s3328	Here	,	we	present	cryo	-	electron	microscopy	analyses	of	negative_regulation_of_cell_migration_bound	to	monoclonal	antibodies	in	which	we	observed	heterogeneous_structures	of	single	and	clustered	C1-immunoglobulin	G1	(	IgG1	)	hexamer	complexes	.	.
s1574	Since	excessive	ingestion	of	vitamin	A	is	known	to	induce	spontaneous_fractures_and	as	the	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	-	induced	femur	angulation	in	mice	appears	to	be	caused	by	intrauterine	fractures	,	we	analyzed	bones	from	a	CYP26B1	deficient	human	and	rats	with	hypervitaminosis	A	to	further	explore	Vegfa	as	a	mechanistic	link	for	the	effect	of	vitamin	A	on	bone	.	.
s2607	Oropharyngeal	cancer_associations	were	limited	to	the	human	leukocyte	antigen	(	HLA	)	region	,	and	classical	HLA	allele	imputation	showed	a	protective	association	with	the	class	II	haplotype	HLA	-	DRB1	1301-HLA	-	DQA1	0103-immunoglobulin_production_involved_in_immunoglobulin_mediated_immune_response	0603	(	odds	ratio	(	OR	)	=	0.59	,	P	=	2.7	x	10	-	9	)	.	.
s3531	Smac	/	intrinsic_apoptotic_signaling_pathway_in_response_to_oxidative_stress_expression	is	markedly	different	between	drug	-	resistant	and	chemo	sensitive	tumor_cells	.	.
s2812	In	addition	,	we	found	that	HCRP1	up	-	regulation	decreased	the	levels	of	p	-	ERK	and	p	-	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_in	glioma_cells	.	.
s174	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal_recessive_Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	mitochondrial_fission	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy	(	SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s4051	In	this	study	,	we	evaluated	the	effect	of	regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_inactivation	on	biologic	behavior	of	primary	(	Caco-2	)	and	metastatic	colon	cancer_cells	(	LoVo	and	SNU407	)	and	the	relation	of	p	-	STAT3	expression	with	the	invasion	of	colon	tumor	.	.
s1078	Genomic	DNA	of	the	siblings	affected	by	FH	with	biopsy	-	proven	FSGS	was	analyzed	,	and	their	father	was	screened	for	18	gene	mutations	associated	with	FSGS	[	nephrin	,	podocin	,	CD2	associated	protein	,	phospholipase	C	e	,	actinin	a	4	,	transient	receptor	potential	cation	channel	subfamily	C	member	6	,	inverted	formin	,	FH2	and	WH2	domain	containing	,	Wilms	tumor_1	,	LIM	homeobox	transcription	factor	1	b	,	laminin	subunit	b	2	,	laminin	subunit	b	3	,	galactosida	a	,	integrin	subunit	b	4	,	scavenger	receptor	class	B	member	2	,	coenzyme	Q2	,	decaprenyl	diphosphate	synthase	subunit	2	,	mitochondrially	encoded	tRNA	leucine	1	(	UUA	/	G	,	TRNL1	)	and	chromatin_remodeling	/	SNF	related	,	matrix	associated	,	actin	dependent	regulator	of	chromatin	,	subfamily	a	like	1	]	using	matrix	-	assisted	laser	desorption	/	ionization	time	-	of	-	flight	mass	spectrometry	technology	.	.
s3078	Result	,	Three	mutant	genes	(	peptidyl	-	tyrosine_dephosphorylation_gene	in	chromosome	12	,	RIT1	gene	in	chromosome	1	and	RAF1	gene	in	chromosome	3	)	in	five	cases	all	had	been	reported	to	be	related	to	hypertrophic	cardiomyopathy	.	.
s2547	This	report	provides	evidence	that	bi	-	allelic	null	skeletal_system_development_mutations	may	lead	to	a	multi	-	system	autosomal_recessive_disorders	,	where	SCID	might	represent	the	main	feature	.
s1832	Because	of	these	wide	-	ranging	roles	,	dysregulation	of	the	cGMP_biosynthetic_process	-	cGMP	signaling	axis	has	been	implicated	in	the	pathogenesis	of	bowel	transit	disorders	,	inflammatory	bowel	disease	,	and	colorectal	cancer	.	.
s630	In	addition	,	we	found	that	FOXC1	regulation	of	RAB3GAP1	,	RAB3GAP2	and	SNAP25	affects	secretion	of	Myocilin	(	osteoblast_differentiation	)	,	a	protein	associated	with	juvenile_onset_glaucoma	and	steroid	-	induced	glaucoma	.	.
s1733	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	chemotaxis	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s3736	Mutations	with	milder	presentation	(	homozygous	p	.	D132A	/	EXOSC3	or	protein_phosphorylation	)	may	display	additionally	signs	of	upper	motor	neuron	impairment	,	dystonia	or	ataxia_and	die	at	age	between	5	and	18	years	.	.
s2454	Meanwhile	,	MLH3	rs175057	CAAAAT	locus	was	also	associated	with	longer	overall	survival	time	in	locally	advanced	rectal	cancer_(HR=0.44	,	95	%	CI	,	0.20	-	0.96	,	P=0.038	)	,	whereas	DNA_repair_rs3771273	TAAAAA	,	rs10188090	AAAAAG	and	rs10191478	TAAAAG	loci	were	associated	with	shorter	overall	survival	time	(	HR=1.74	,	95	%	CI	,	1.06	-	2.84	,	P=0.028	,	HR=1.64	,	95	%	CI	,	1.01	-	2.66	,	P=0.046	,	HR=1.71	,	95	%	CI	,	1.01	-	2.91	,	P=0.047	,	respectively	)	.	.

s1930	Our	results	showed	that	treatment	with	MEHP	enriched	the	population	of	cancer	-	stem	-	cell	(	CSC)-like	cells	and	upregulated	IL-8	expression	by	inducing	the	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	-	b	-	catenin	-	TCF4	signaling	pathway	.	.
s3792	Oral	cancer_was	associated	with	two	new	regions	,	2p23.3	(	rs6547741	,	GPN1	)	and	9q34.12	(	rs928674	,	LAMC3	)	,	and	with	known	cancer	-	related	loci-9p21.3	(	rs8181047	,	regulation_of_cyclin	-	dependent_protein_serine	/	threonine_kinase_activity	-	AS1	)	and	5p15.33	(	rs10462706	,	CLPTM1L	)	.	.
s3713	Germline	mutations	in	cell_adhesion_are	responsible	for	a	rare	cancer_predisposition	syndrome	that	includes	predisposition	to	mesothelioma	.	.

s3457	Immunohistochemistry	demonstrated	that	the	loss	of	peptidyl	-	threonine_phosphorylation_expression	,	which	was	observed	in	50.8	%	of	primary	gastric	cancer_tissues	(	n=128	)	,	significantly	correlated	with	advanced	tumor	stage	(	PAAAA0.001	)	,	frequent	lymph	node	metastasis	(	PAAAA0.001	)	,	distant	metastasis	(	P=0.013	)	,	tumor	differentiation	(	P=0.004	)	and	unfavorable	overall	survival	(	PAAAA0.001	)	.	.
s3294	Moreover	,	the	expression	of	negative_regulation_of_kinase_activity_was	correlated	with	age	and	tumor	size	in	the	TCGA	cohort	containing	708	cases	of	breast	cancer	.	.
s1715	MED1	mediates	induction	of	cell	proliferation	and	migration	and	the	genes	associated	with	it	(	JUN	,	FOS	,	EGFR	,	VEGF	,	MMP1	,	and	ERBB4	)	in	breast	cancer	,	which	is	abrogated	when	used	together	with	protein_polyubiquitination-191-inhibition	.	.
s3797	In	colorectal	cancer	,	cellular_response_to_DNA_damage_stimulus	-	mediated	induction	of	unregulated	cell	growth	involves	posttranslational	mechanisms	that	prevent	proteasomal	degradation	of	proto	-	oncogene	b	-	catenin	(	CTNNB1	)	and	its	eventual	translocation	to	the	nucleus	.	.
s3403	Mutations	in	visual_perception_are	associated	with	hereditary	autosomal	dominant	and	recessive	cataract_formation	.	.
s472	However	,	human	newborns	deficient	in	negative_regulation_of_Wnt_signaling_pathway_do	not	spontaneously	develop	tumors	.	.
s1399	ARID5B	also	activates	the	expression	of	the	oncogene	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_Importantly	,	ARID5B	is	required	for	the	survival	and	growth	of	T	-	ALL	cells	,	and	forced	expression	of	ARID5B	in	immature	thymocytes	results	in	thymus	retention	,	differentiation	arrest	,	radioresistance	,	and	tumor_formation	in	zebrafish	.	.
s613	On	the	other	hand	,	MYH1	,	MYH2	,	MYH3	,	regulation_of_the_force_of_heart_contraction	,	MYH8	,	FOXO3	,	NFATC1	,	PTGS2	,	KAT6B	,	HDAC4	,	and	RUNX2	expression	is	suspected	to	be	involved	in	the	epigenetic	regulations	behind	the	mandibular	prognathism_phenotype	.

s1352	In	this	study	,	the	fluorescence	lifetime	of	the	metabolic	coenzyme	NADH	reveals	that	the	absence	of	REV3L	can	promote	the	DNA_strand_renaturation	-	mediated	upregulation	of	oxidative	phosphorylation	in	cisplatin	-	treated	H1299	lung	carcinoma	cells	and	increases	cancer_cell	sensitivity	to	this	platinum	-	based	chemotherapy	.	.
s119	In	summary	,	the	identification	of	mitotic_cell_cycle_mutations	in	individuals	with	microcephaly_and	a	spectrum	of	anomalies	in	eye	development	,	particularly	photoreceptor	anomalies	,	provides	evidence	of	an	important	role	for	the	y	-	TuRC	in	brain	and	eye	development	.
s406	Mutations	in	the	LDB3	gene	have	been	identified	in	patients	with	Z	-	disc	-	associated	,	alternatively	spliced	,	PDZ	motif	-	containing	protein	(	sarcomere_organization)-related	myofibrillar	myopathy	(	ZASP	-	MFM	)	characterized	by	late	-	onset	distal	myopathy	with	signs	of	cardiomyopathy	and	neuropathy	.	.
s1106	Aberrant	activation	of	the	Hedgehog	pathway	represents	the	molecular	driver	in	basal_cell_carcinoma_pathogenesis	,	with	the	majority	of	BCCs	carrying	somatic	point	mutations	,	mainly	ultraviolet	(	UV)-induced	,	and/or	copy	-	loss	of	heterozygosis	in	the	positive_regulation_of_cholesterol_efflux_gene	.	.
s3050	We	suggest	that	leukemias	and	lymphomas	with	FLT3	fusion	genes	exhibit	similar	clinicopathologic	features	to	,	and	should	be	included	in	,	the	WHO	category	of	AAAAAAMyeloid	and	lymphoid	neoplasms	with	eosinophilia_and	abnormalities	of	PDGFRA	,	signal_transduction	,	or	FGFR1	,	or	with	PCM1-JAK2.AAAAA	.
s1338	Here	we	show	that	the	microphthalmia	-	associated	transcription	factor	,	MITF	,	which	plays	a	central	role	in	the	development	and	function	of	RPE	cells	,	regulates	the	expression	of	two	visual	cycle	genes	,	retinoid_metabolic_process_which	encodes	retinaldehyde	binding	protein-1	(	RLBP1	)	,	and	Rdh5	,	which	encodes	retinol	dehydrogenase-5	(	RDH5	)	.	.
s3963	We	provide	functional	evidence	to	support	the	pathogenicity	of	these	mitochondrial_respiratory_chain_complex_I_assembly_variants	,	including	evidence	of	founder	effects	for	both	variants	,	and	establish	defects	within	this	gene	as	a	cause	of	complex	I	deficiency	in	association	with	either	pure	myopathy	in	adulthood	or	,	in	one	individual	,	a	severe	multisystem	presentation	(	chronic	renal_failure_and	cardiomyopathy	)	in	infancy	.	.
s713	protein_K27-linked_ubiquitination_increased	breast	cancer_cell	proliferation	,	migration	and	reduced	cell	sensitivity	to	doxorubicin	.	.
s3223	The	up	-	regulation	of	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_is	correlated	with	high	disease	stage	and	predicts	overall	and	disease	-	free	survival	in	patients	with	breast	cancer	.	.
s2644	Methylation	profiling	,	metabolite	assessment	and	additional	analyses	were	also	performed	in	selected	cases	.	Results	,	One	of	the	11	tumors	was	found	to	carry	a	known	cancer	-	predisposing	somatic	mutation	in	isocitrate_metabolic_process_A	variant	in	GOT2	,	c.357AAAAAT	,	found	in	a	patient	with	multiple	tumors	,	was	associated	with	higher	tumor	mRNA	and	protein	expression	levels	,	increased	GOT2	enzymatic	activity	in	lymphoblastic	cells	,	and	altered	metabolite	ratios	both	in	tumors	and	in	GOT2	knockdown	HeLa	cells	transfected	with	the	variant	.	.

s1436	The	F	-	box	protein	cellular_response_to_DNA_damage_stimulus_is	a	tumor_suppressor	that	is	encoded	in	16q24.3	,	for	which	there	is	loss	of	heterozygosity	in	various	solid	tumors	.	.
s2431	The	lysosome	-	associated	membrane	proteins	(	regulation_of_autophagys	)	display	differential	expression	particularly	in	cancer	.	.
s1304	Therefore	,	we	investigated	the	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_of	altering	the	MPC1	gene	expression	on	the	malignant	potential	of	cancer_cells	using	biliary	tract	cancer	cell	lines	in	vitro	.	.

s2847	Moreover	,	inhibition	of	MYC	target	pyrimidine	synthesis	genes	such	as	apoptotic_DNA_fragmentation	,	UMPS	,	and	CTPS	blocked	cell	growth	,	and	thus	are	potential	targets	for	colorectal	cancer_therapy	.
s1455	Germline	mutations	in	KCNJ5	and	CACNA1H	cause	FH	-	III	and	FH	-	IV	,	respectively	,	while	germline	mutations	in	calcium_ion_transport_cause	the	rare	PASNA	syndrome	,	featuring	primary	aldosteronism	seizures_and	neurological	abnormalities	.	.
s2759	The	cellular_response_to_DNA_damage_stimulus_1A	promoter	was	hypermethylated	in	7	of	36	tumours	from	never	-	smokers	(	19	%	)	,	12	of	47	tumours	from	former	smokers	(	26	%	)	,	and	8	of	13	tumours	from	active	smokers	(	62	%	)	.	.
s3923	Variants	in	CPB1	,	proteolysis_(encoding	carboxypeptidase	B1	and	A1	)	,	and	CTRC	were	evaluated	in	a	second	set	of	cases	with	familial	pancreatic	cancer_and	controls	.	.
s2806	Mutations	with	milder	presentation	(	homozygous	p	.	D132A	/	rRNA_processing_or	VRK1	)	may	display	additionally	signs	of	upper	motor	neuron	impairment	,	dystonia	or	ataxia_and	die	at	age	between	5	and	18	years	.	.
s2758	Our	analyses	identified	15	CpG	sites	within	the	APC	1A	promoter	that	were	significantly	hypermethylated	and	14	CpG	loci	within	the	calcineurin	-	NFAT_signaling_cascade_gene	body	that	were	significantly	hypomethylated	(	pLIS	AAAA	1	x	10	-	5	)	in	the	tumours	of	active	smokers	.	.
s513	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_knockdown	by	shRNA	inhibited	tumor_cell	proliferation	,	migration	,	invasion	,	and	epithelial	-	mesenchymal	transition	in	vitro	,	as	well	as	tumorigenesis	and	liver	metastasis	in	vivo	,	whereas	these	effects	were	reversed	following	AF1q	overexpression	.	.
s2016	The	mechanism	by	which	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination_protects	against	cancer_and	chronic	inflammation	is	unknown	.	.
s2890	In	this	study	,	we	found	that	tumor_suppressor	candidate	3	(	magnesium_ion_transport	)	was	downregulated	in	temozolomide	-	resistant	U87MG	cells	(	U87MG	-	res	cells	)	and	its	restoration	sensitized	U87MG	-	res	cells	to	temozolomide	.	.
s1192	Additionally	,	the	SNP	of	rs57095329	showed	statistical	significances	with	the	appearances	of	mutism	and	the	positive	of	cerebrospinal	fluid	(	CSF	)	protein	14	-	3	-	3	in	sCJD	patients	,	while	the	SNP	of	ZBTB38-MAPK_cascade_was	significantly	related	with	the	appearance	of	myoclonus_in	sCJD	patients	.	.
s262	Here	we	show	that	the	microphthalmia	-	associated	transcription	factor	,	MITF	,	which	plays	a	central	role	in	the	development	and	function	of	RPE	cells	,	regulates	the	expression	of	two	visual	cycle	genes	,	Rlbp1	which	encodes	retinaldehyde	binding	protein-1	(	RLBP1	)	,	and	Rdh5	,	which	encodes	retinol	dehydrogenase-5	(	retinoid_metabolic_process	)	.	.
s272	Among	them	four	novel	fusion	genes	SEPT9/CYHR	,	IGF1R	/	TTC23	,	SYT8/TNNI2	and	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	/	DFFA	were	validated	and	characterized	in	48	formalin	-	fixed	paraffin	-	embedded	(	FFPE	)	specimens	of	bladder	cancer	.	.
s2573	The	negative_regulation_of_cell_proliferation	,	TUSC4	and	MLH1	expression	was	analysed	in	lung	tumour	tissue	samples	obtained	from	69	patients	diagnosed	with	NSCLC	,	squamous_cell_carcinoma_(n	=	34	)	,	adenocarcinoma	(	n	=	24	)	,	large	cell	carcinoma	(	n	=	5	)	,	carcinoma	adenosquamosum	(	n	=	5	)	.	.
s3214	Never	in	mitosis	gene	-	A	(	NIMA)-related	expressed	kinase	2	(	protein_phosphorylation	)	has	been	recently	reported	to	play	a	role	in	tumor_progression	,	drug	resistance	and	tumorigenesis	.	.
s2938	The	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_subfamily	,	including	FGF9	,	FGF16	,	and	FGF20	,	in	addition	to	rhFGF16	,	rhFGF9	,	and	rhFGF20	,	were	shown	to	stimulate	the	proliferation	and	migration	of	HuH7	human	hepatocellular_carcinoma_(HCC	)	cells	.	.
s2731	However	,	certain	chromatin	remodeling	genes	(	MLL1	,	MLL2	,	MLL3	,	BAP1	,	PBRM1	,	EED	,	and	ATRX	)	were	found	to	be	mutated	in	7/22	(	32	%	)	of	intraductal	tubulopapillary	neoplasms	and	27	%	harbored	phosphatidylinositol	3-kinase	(	PI3	K	)	pathway	(	PIK3CA	,	PIK3CB	,	phosphatidylinositol_biosynthetic_process	,	and	PTEN	)	mutations	.	.
s1885	Intriguingly	,	MRE11	is	highly	expressed	and	predicts	bad	prognosis	in	positive_regulation_of_gene_expression	-	amplified	neuroblastoma	.	.
s3641	fatty_acid_metabolic_process_was	upregulated	in	liver	cancer_tissues	,	and	the	upregulation	was	associated	with	certain	clinicopathologic	features	of	patients	with	liver	cancer	.	.
s1936	The	protein	product	of	the	breast	and	ovarian	cancer_gene	,	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination	,	is	part	of	an	obligate	heterodimer	with	BARD1	.	.
s3346	Mutations	in	autophagosome_membrane_docking_gene	result	in	CEDNIK	(	Cerebral	dysgenesis	,	neuropathy	,	ichthyosis	and	palmoplantar_keratoderma	)	syndrome	.	.
s3273	In	this	study	,	we	established	fat_cell_differentiation_as	a	therapeutic	target	for	glioma_treatment	.	.
s2402	Mutant	mice	for	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_were	reported	to	present	with	facial_weakness	,	resembling	MBS	.	.
s3563	Eight	of	the	genes	,	APC	,	TP53	,	ATM	,	CSMD3	,	LRP1B	,	RYR2	,	regulation_of_cytokinesis	,	and	MUC17	,	contained	mutations	in	AAAA20	%	of	the	carcinomas	.	.
s1637	Inhibition	of	DNA_strand_renaturation	-	MDM2	complex	has	been	emerging	as	a	strategy	for	antitumoral	drug	development	considering	the	pro	-	apoptotic	role	of	functional	p53	in	tumor	cells	.	.
s3369	This	report	confirmed	that	haploinsufficiency	of	the	2	long	forms	of	positive_regulation_of_chondrocyte_differentiation_presents	common	clinical	features	,	including	mild	intellectual_disability_and	autistic	features	,	which	could	be	useful	for	the	clinical	diagnosis	of	Lamb	-	Shaffer	syndrome	.
s2442	We	demonstrated	that	linc	-	adenosine_catabolic_process_interacts	with	heterogeneous_nuclear	ribonucleoprotein	U	(	hnRNPU	)	and	insulin	-	like	growth	factor	2	mRNA	binding	protein	2	(	IGF2BP2	)	at	distinct	subcellular	locations	to	regulate	adipocyte	differentiation	and	lipogenesis	.
s470	Impact	statement	negative_regulation_of_Wnt_signaling_pathway_was	originally	designated	as	a	tumor_suppressor	.	.
s1451	Somatic	mutations	in	four	genes	(	KCNJ5	,	cellular_sodium_ion_homeostasis	,	ATP2B3	and	CACNA1D	)	,	differently	implicated	in	intracellular	ion	homeostasis	,	have	been	identified	in	nearly	60	%	of	the	sporadic_APAs	.	.
s3213	Notably	,	we	demonstrated	that	aberrant	SF3B4	overexpression	altered	the	progress	of	splicing	progress	of	the	tumor_suppressor	gene	,	kruppel	like	factor	4	(	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	)	,	and	resulted	in	non	-	functional	skipped	exon	transcripts	.	.
s2841	We	further	show	that	DNA_strand_renaturationR2	is	important	for	oncogenic	growth	,	migration	and	invasion	in	cervical	cancer_cells	.	.
s3439	The	primary	endpoint	is	the	rate	of	pathological	complete	response	,	defined	as	the	absence	of	invasive	and	intraductal	tumor	cells	in	the	breast	at	surgery	,	in	breast	cancer_with	fatty_acid_beta	-	oxidation_hypermethylation	.	.
s471	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_statement	WWOX	was	originally	designated	as	a	tumor_suppressor	.	.
s1384	Our	data	,	for	the	first	time	,	functionally	link	Jalili	syndrome	gene	metal_ion_homeostasis_to	LCA	gene	IQCB1	,	providing	important	insights	into	the	molecular	pathogenic	mechanism	of	retinal_dystrophy_in	Jalili	syndrome	.
s3434	At	least	some	P5B	isoforms	are	of	vital	importance	for	the	nervous	system	,	since	ATP13A2	and	cellular_calcium_ion_homeostasis_are	linked	to	respectively	Parkinson	disease	and	autism_spectrum	disorders	.
s3829	In	tumors	with	high	phosphatidylinositol_3-kinase_signaling_expression	,	and	independently	of	PIK3CA	,	KRAS	,	or	PTEN	mutations	,	PIK3R2	depletion	induced	lung	SQCC	xenograft	regression	without	triggering	PI3K	/	AKT	pathway	rebound	.	.
s1536	Shh	signaling	mutations	,	like	those	that	remove	Patched1	(	positive_regulation_of_cholesterol_efflux	)	or	activate	Smoothened	(	Smo	)	,	cause	tumors	dependent	on	the	presence	of	cilia	.	.
s3908	Thus	,	here	we	report	a	new	candidate	gene	(	NOL4	)	and	a	haplotype	of	cell_cycle_arrest_forVWS	,	and	highlight	the	genetic	heterogeneity_of	this	disorder	in	the	Indian	population	.
s2245	We	have	already	reported	that	protein_polyubiquitination_mRNA	levels	are	higher	in	breast	cancer	samples	compared	to	adjacent	non	-	tumor_tissue	.	.
s722	Here	,	we	applied	next	-	generation	sequencing	in	89	patients	with	a	clinical	diagnosis	of	distal_renal_tubular_acidosis	,	analyzing	the	prevalence	of	genetic	defects	in	SLC4A1	,	ossification	,	and	ATP6V1B1	genes	and	the	clinical	phenotype	.	.
s2598	In	addition	,	silencing	of	CtBP2	markedly	increased	the	apoptosis	of	PCa	cells	in	vitro	,	and	decreased	the	expression	of	IL-8	,	AT2R	,	G1/S_transition_of_mitotic_cell_cycle_and	MMP9	which	are	associated	with	cancer_progression	.	.
s2984	We	reported	a	milder	form	of	intra	-	Golgi_vesicle	-	mediated_transport_defect	showing	Friedreich	s	-	ataxia	-	like	phenotypes	without	hypotonia	,	microcephaly	,	and	short	stature	that	were	observed	in	most	patients	with	COG5	defect	.
s293	NLS	-	bearing_protein_import_into_nucleus	-	restricted	deletion	of	Ptchd1	leads	to	attention	deficits	and	hyperactivity	,	both	of	which	are	rescued	by	pharmacological	augmentation	of	SK	channel	activity	.	.
s2793	Biallelic	loss	-	of	-	function	mutations	affecting	growth_plate_cartilage_chondrocyte_development_cause	SOFT	syndrome	,	an	ultra	-	rare	condition	characterized	by	short	stature	,	onychodysplasia	,	facial	dysmorphism	and	hypotrichosis	.	.
s1320	Fourteen	different	(	half	of	them	novel	)	non	-	GJB2	variants	causing	HL	were	found	in	10	genes	(	CHD7	,	HDAC8	,	MITF	,	neurofilament_bundle_assembly	,	OTOF	,	SF3B4	,	SLC26A4	,	TECTA	,	TMPRSS3	,	USH2A	)	among	13	probands	,	confirming	the	genetic	heterogeneity_of	hereditary	HL	.	.
s3658	Western	blot	analysis	,	real	-	time	PCR	,	MTT	assay	and	flow	cytometric	analysis	were	performed	and	the	results	demonstrated	that	compared	with	the	gastric	cancer_muscle_organ_development-7901	cells	,	the	expression	of	NIBP	,	NF	-	kB	p65	,	NF	-	kB	p	-	p65	and	mesenchymal	marker	vimentin	were	significantly	increased	in	gastric	cancer	multidrug	-	resistant	SGC-7901/CDDP	cells	,	and	the	epithelial	cell	marker	ZO-1	was	significantly	decreased	.	.
s1102	In	two	different	patients	with	unilateral_cryptorchidism	,	we	found	the	variants	rs121912556	and	p	.	R105R	of	positive_regulation_of_epithelial_cell_migration_gene	in	a	heterozygous	form	associated	with	cryptorchidism	,	so	we	could	considered	them	as	risk	factors	for	cryptorchidism	.	.
s1887	Encapsulation	of	mirin	in	nanoparticles	allowed	its	use	on	positive_regulation_of_gene_expression	-	amplified	neuroblastoma	xenografts	in	vivo	,	which	resulted	in	a	sharp	impairment	of	tumor_growth	,	associated	with	DDR	activation	,	p53	accumulation	,	and	cell	death	.	.
s3275	Expression	of	PSMB8	as	well	as	regulation_of_proteasomal_protein_catabolic_process-67	was	higher	in	glioma_tissues	demonstrated	by	western	blot	and	immunohistochemistry	.	.
s765	We	here	review	the	current	knowledge	and	recent	findings	in	the	known	genes	for	isolated	dystonia_TOR1A	,	THAP1	,	and	GNAL	as	well	as	for	the	combined	dystonias	due	to	mutations	in	tetrahydrobiopterin_biosynthetic_process	,	ATP1A3	,	and	SGCE	.	.
s2336	We	believe	that	this	strategy	combined	with	multi	-	dimensional	analysis	of	sialic	acid	metabolism	will	ultimately	provide	novel	insights	into	breast	cancer_subcardiac_muscle_tissue_developments	and	provide	a	foundation	for	new	methods	of	diagnosis	.
s3592	Lynch	syndrome	,	a	hereditary	cancer_syndrome	,	occurs	because	of	germline	mutations	in	at	least	one	of	four	DNA	mismatch	repair	genes	(	MutL	Homolog	1	(	MLH1	)	,	MutS	Homolog	2	(	MSH2	)	,	MutS	Homolog	6	(	DNA_repair	)	,	and	PMS1	Homolog	2	(	PMS2	)	)	.	.
s3483	Finally	,	we	demonstrate	that	genetic	inactivation	of	camera	-	type_eye_development_rescues	axial	elongation	in	a	mouse	model	of	myopia_caused	by	a	null	mutation	in	Egr1	.	.
s1276	There	were	no	significant	differences	in	tumor_characteristics	,	including	size	at	pathologic	examination	,	grade	,	hormone	receptor	status	,	and	nodal	status	,	between	the	screening	-	detected	invasive	cancers	on	DM	versus	biological_process_(P	=	.09-.99	)	.	.
s3388	Prolyl	endopeptidase	-	like	(	regulation_of_synaptic_vesicle_exocytosis	)	deficiency	(	MIM	#	616224	)	is	a	rare	autosomal	recessive	inherited	congenital	myasthenic	syndrome	characterized	by	neonatal	hypotonia	,	feeding	problems	,	mild	dysmorphism	,	and	neuromuscular	symptoms	,	followed	by	hyperphagia_and	obesity	in	later	childhood	.	.
s3618	While	these	expansions	occur	in	coding	and	noncoding	regions	,	microsatellite	sequence	and	repeat	length	diversity	is	more	prominent	in	introns	with	eight	different	trinucleotide	to	hexanucleotide	repeats	,	causing	hereditary	diseases	such	as	myotonic	dystrophy	type	2	(	DM2	)	,	Fuchs	endothelial	corneal_dystrophy_(FECD	)	,	and	negative_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_amyotrophic	lateral	sclerosis	and	frontotemporal	dementia	(	C9-ALS	/	FTD	)	.	.
s2054	Using	a	targeted	sequencing	skeletal_dysplasia_panel	,	the	proband	was	found	to	be	a	compound	heterozygote	for	two	mutations	in	sulfate_transmembrane_transport	,	one	novel	mutation	,	p	.	Ser522Phe	and	the	other	,	the	common	mutation	,	p	.	Arg279Trp	.	.
s961	In	an	additional	affected	individual	with	ammonium_transmembrane_transport_and	a	congenital_heart_defect	,	we	found	a	homozygous	loss	-	of	-	function	(	LOF	)	variant	in	SLIT3	,	recapitulating	phenotypes	reported	with	Slit3	inactivation	in	the	mouse	.	.
s999	We	show	that	hypermethylation	of	p16/Ink4a	and	p19/G1/S_transition_of_mitotic_cell_cycle_in	CNT-	and	asbestos	-	induced	inflammatory	lesions	precedes	mesothelioma	,	this	results	in	silencing	of	Cdkn2a	(	Ink4a	/	Arf	)	and	loss	of	p16	and	p19	protein	,	consistent	with	epigenetic	alterations	playing	a	gatekeeper	role	in	cancer	.	.
s3311	Mutations	in	peripheral_nervous_system_development_gene	have	been	described	in	relation	to	infantile	onset	epilepsy_with	movement	disorders	and	developmental	delay	.	.
s1550	Hepatic	hnRNPA1	overexpression	also	activated	the	negative_regulation_of_endothelial_cell_proliferation	/	Akt	pathway	and	repressed	the	mTOR	/	SREBP-1C	pathway	to	ameliorate	hyperglycemia_and	steatosis	in	obese	mice	.	.
s2903	The	present	study	also	identified	in	tumor	and	potentially	malignant	lesions	common	alterations	of	chromosomal	regions	and	genes	,	including	FBXL5	,	UGT2B15	,	UGT2B28	,	histone_H4-K5_acetylation	,	GSTT1	and	DUSP22	,	being	some	of	these	typical	aberrations	described	in	oral	cancer_and	others	are	linked	to	chemoradioresistance	.	.
s2660	We	therefore	suggest	that	sucrose_transport	,	c.1287delC	causes	the	observed	oculocutaneous	albinism_in	the	affected	Bullmastiff	.
s2473	The	aim	of	the	present	study	is	to	evaluate	clock	(	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	cry2	and	per2	)	and	clock	-	controlled	(	vascular	endothelial	growth	factor	-	a	,	early	growth	response	protein	1	and	estrogen	receptor	b	)	gene	expression	in	colorectal	cancer_and	adjacent	tissue	and	identify	a	possible	link	between	survival	of	patients	and	expression	of	above	mentioned	genes	.	.
s1503	A	replicative	analysis	of	associations	of	15	SNPs	located	in	the	regions	of	11	genes	(	TCF4	,	VRK2	,	NOTCH4	,	ZNF804A	,	C	-	terminal_protein_deglutamylation	,	RELN	,	ZFP64P1	,	KCNB2	,	CSMD1	,	CPVL	,	NRIP1	)	and	three	intergenic	regions	(	SLCO6A1/LINCOO491	,	LOC105376248/LOC105376249	,	SPA17/NRGN	)	with	schizophrenia_was	conducted	in	the	Russian	population	of	the	Siberian	region	.	.
s1143	Using	this	gene	panel	,	we	were	able	to	identify	disease	-	causing	variants	in	17	out	of	87	(	19.5	%	)	analyzed	patients	,	all	found	in	known	epilepsy	-	associated	genes	(	KCNQ2	,	CDKL5	,	STXBP1	,	SCN1A	,	PCDH19	,	POLG	,	SLC2A1	,	ARX	,	ALG13	,	CHD2	,	negative_regulation_of_Ras_protein_signal_transduction	,	and	GRIN1	)	.	.
s388	SNP	microarray	and	whole	exome	sequencing	identified	a	homozygous	frameshift	mutation	(	p	.	L870V	)	in	SCARF2	and	predicted	damaging	mutations	in	several	genes	,	most	notably	DGCR2	(	p	.	P75L	)	and	neuron_cell	-	cell_adhesion_(p	.	S147	G	)	,	both	possible	candidates	for	this	child	s	intellectual_disability	.	.
s2213	positive_regulation_of_antigen_processing_and_presentation_of_peptide_antigen_via_MHC_class_II_protein	levels	were	also	negatively	correlated	with	the	severity	of	symptoms	in	humans	affected	by	autism	.	.
s1576	By	combining	meta	-	analysis	results	and	identification	of	two	unrelated	HCM	patients	with	homozygous	cardiac_muscle_hypertrophy_truncating	variants	,	we	suggest	that	the	association	of	CSRP3	as	a	validated	HCM	-	causing	gene	require	additional	studies	and	those	CSRP3	variants	could	result	in	HCM	with	an	autosomal_recessive_inheritance	rather	than	with	an	autosomal	dominant	transmission	as	usually	reported	on	HCM	(	OMIM	612124	)	.
s1729	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	positive_regulation_of_GTPase_activity	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s131	We	used	a	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_of	previously	uncharacterized	antibodies	against	the	cancer	/	testis	antigens	ADAM2	,	CALR3	and	SAGE1	to	investigate	their	expression	in	a	large	panel	of	normal	tissues	as	well	as	breast	and	lung	cancers	.	.
s3839	spliceosomal_snRNP_assembly_was	independently	mutated	in	families	with	a	syndrome	of	cataract	,	global	developmental	delay	with	or	without	renal	involvement	.	.
s2777	These	findings	reveal	that	centriole_replication_contributes	to	building	full	-	length	centrioles	and	illuminate	the	molecular	mechanism	through	which	the	RTTN	(	A578P	)	mutation	causes	primary	microcephaly	.	Mutations	in	many	centriolar	protein	-	encoding	genes	cause	primary	microcephaly	.	.
s2326	A	prognostication	scoring	system	was	established	based	on	the	expression	levels	of	RNASEH2A-	,	peptidyl	-	serine_phosphorylation-	,	and	CD151-related	genes	,	which	could	effectively	predict	the	overall	survival	in	a	TCGA	clear	cell	RCC	cohort	(	n	=	533	,	995.3	versus	2242.2	days	,	p	AAAA	0.0001	)	,	in	another	clear_cell_renal_cell_carcinoma_(ccRCC	)	cohort	E	-	GEOD-22541	(	n	=	44	,	390.0	versus	1889.2	days	,	p	=	0.0007	)	,	and	in	a	TCGA	papillary	RCC	(	pRCC	)	cohort	(	n	=	287	,	741.6	versus	1623.7	days	,	p	AAAA	0.0001	)	.	.

s2176	An	abnormality	in	the	miRNA_catabolic_process	/	let-7a	axis	is	relevant	to	the	progression	of	hepatitis	B	virus	(	HBV)-positive	hepatocellular	carcinoma	(	HCC	)	,	which	could	be	a	novel	therapeutic	target	for	this	malignant	tumor	.	.
s1946	The	results	suggest	a	conditional	regulation	of	KRT16	gene	by	response_to_endoplasmic_reticulum_stress_that	may	be	inhibited	in	normal	cells	,	but	engaged	during	cancer_progression	.	.
s2143	In	addition	,	no	somatic_mutation_was	found	in	sodium_ion_transport_DNA	.	.
s3593	Lynch	syndrome	,	a	hereditary	cancer_syndrome	,	occurs	because	of	germline	mutations	in	at	least	one	of	four	DNA	mismatch	repair	genes	(	MutL	Homolog	1	(	MLH1	)	,	MutS	Homolog	2	(	MSH2	)	,	MutS	Homolog	6	(	MSH6	)	,	and	mismatch_repair_Homolog	2	(	PMS2	)	)	.	.
s2722	The	more	common	member	of	this	family	,	intraductal	papillary	mucinous	neoplasm	,	often	carries	genetic	alterations	typical	of	pancreatic	infiltrating	ductal	adenocarcinoma	(	KRAS	,	TP53	,	and	CDKN2A	)	but	additionally	has	mutations	in	adenylate_cyclase	-	activating_G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway_and	RNF43	genes	.	.

s1301	However	,	only	a	few	studies	have	assessed	the	clinical	significance	of	mitochondrial_pyruvate_transmembrane_transport_and	the	molecular	mechanisms	underlying	its	influence	on	cancer_progression	are	not	well	understood	.	.
s3166	positive_regulation_of_cytosolic_calcium_ion_concentration_and	GJB2	genes	variants	contribute	significantly	in	familial	cases	of	prelingual	recessive	hearing_loss_(HL	)	.	.
s1117	We	expand	the	knowledge	about	TTC7A	deficiency	,	describing	a	patient	with	the	mild	phenotype	of	TTC7A	deficiency	but	presenting	overlapping	features	of	negative_regulation_of_protein_export_from_nucleus	/	THE	and	MIA	-	CID	,	intestinal	atresia	and	inflammatory	bowel	disease	evocative	of	MIA	-	CID	,	but	also	dental_abnormalities	,	huge	forehead	,	liver	abnormalities	,	autoimmune	thyroiditis	and	hypogammaglobulinemia	,	evocative	of	SD	/	THE	.
s1705	Lately	,	ARMC5	was	linked	to	the	cyclic	AMP	signaling	pathway	,	which	could	be	implicated	in	all	of	mechanisms	of	cortisol	-	secreting	by	macronodules	adrenal_hyperplasia_and	the	molecular	defects	in	,	G	protein	aberrant	receptors	,	MC2R	,	GNAS	,	negative_regulation_of_cAMP	-	dependent_protein_kinase_activity	,	PDE11A	,	PDE8B.	.
s3313	Mutations	in	actin_cytoskeleton_reorganization_have	been	associated	with	GAPO	(	growth	retardation	,	alopecia	,	pseudoanodontia	,	and	optic_atrophy	)	syndrome	and	infantile	hemangioma	,	however	no	clinical	characteristics	associated	with	these	conditions	were	observed	in	our	study	family	.	.
s1543	Mechanistically	,	lncSHGL	recruited	heterogeneous_nuclear	ribonucleoprotein	A1	(	hnRNPA1	)	to	enhance	the	translation	efficiency	of	CALM	mRNAs	to	increase	calmodulin	(	CaM	)	protein	level	without	affecting	their	transcription	,	leading	to	the	activation	of	the	phosphatidyl	inositol	3-kinase	(	PI3K)/positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_pathway	and	repression	of	the	mTOR	/	SREBP-1C	pathway	independent	of	insulin	and	calcium	in	hepatocytes	.	.
s3851	We	report	here	that	the	tumor_suppressor	ING1b	binds	rDNA	,	regulates	rDNA	chromatin	modifications	and	affects	nucleolar	localization	of	regulation_of_cell_growth_to	modulate	rRNA	levels	.	.
s3316	Growth	abnormalities	,	motor	dysfunction	,	hindlimb	paralysis	,	muscle	wasting	,	neurogenic	atrophy	,	motor_neuron_degeneration	,	and	loss	of	large	-	caliber	axons	in	peripheral	nerves	occurred	at	an	earlier	age	in	cytoskeleton_organization	/	Scyl3	double	-	deficient	mice	than	in	Scyl1-deficient	mice	.	.

s1392	Taken	together	,	the	results	indicate	that	increase	of	HS	content	and	up	-	regulation	of	receptor	-	mediated_endocytosis	/	HSPG2	expression	in	glioblastoma_tissues	contribute	to	tumour	development	through	the	transformation	of	brain	extracellular	matrix	into	tumour	microenvironment	,	and	represent	negative	prognostic	factors	for	glioblastoma	progression	.
s1567	Objective	,	To	investigate	the	histomorpholgic	spectrum	,	immunophenotypic	,	and	molecular	genetic	features	of	Sertoli	cell	tumor	,	not	otherwise	specified	(	brain_development	,	NOS	)	of	the	testis	.	.
s1419	Taken	together	,	these	findings	offer	additional	insight	into	the	early	transcriptional	changes	caused	by	Cryaa	and	negative_regulation_of_intracellular_transport_mutations	associated	with	autosomal	dominant	human	cataracts	,	and	indicate	that	the	transcript	levels	of	certain	genes	are	affected	by	the	expression	of	mutant	a	-	crystallin	in	vivo	.
s167	Mutations	in	the	ALS5/SPG11/chemical_synaptic_transmission_gene	are	a	frequent	cause	of	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	peripheral	axonal	neuropathy	,	and	account	for	a	40	%	of	autosomal	recessive	juvenile	amyotrophic	lateral	sclerosis	.	.
s1594	MiRNAs	are	also	protein_glycosylationcreted	through	the	small	vesicles	called	exosomes	,	which	are	endosome	-	derived	vesicles	from	various	cell	types	including	immune	and	tumor_cells	.	.
s1522	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	aging	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s1880	We	observed	significant	hearing_loss_and	progressive	degeneration	of	stereocilia	in	the	outer	hair	cells	of	sensory_perception_of_sound	-	null	mice	starting	from	postnatal	day	30	.	.
s2503	CHD	proteins	play	an	important	role	in	neurodevelopment	,	as	pathogenic	variants	in	CHD1	,	CHD2	,	ATP	-	dependent_chromatin_remodeling	,	CHD7	and	CHD8	have	been	associated	with	a	range	of	neurological	phenotypes	,	including	autism	spectrum	disorder	(	ASD	)	,	intellectual	disability	(	ID	)	and	epilepsy	.	.
s3417	Hepatocyte	growth	factor	(	HGF)/c	-	endothelial_cell_morphogenesis_signaling	plays	an	important	role	in	cell	proliferation	,	survival	,	migration	and	motility	of	cancer_cells	.	.
s4046	We	further	review	the	variety	of	melanocytic	tumors	associated	with	such	protein_phosphorylation_fusions	.
s933	Recent	research	published	in	the	Journal	of	Pathology	showed	that	genetic	depletion	of	any	of	the	NOX2	subunits	cytochrome_complex_assembly	,	Cybb	,	Ncf1	,	Ncf2	and	Ncf4	reduced	the	formation	of	lung	metastases	following	intravenous	injection	of	murine	tumor_cells	.	.
s1544	Mechanistically	,	lncSHGL	recruited	heterogeneous_nuclear	ribonucleoprotein	A1	(	hnRNPA1	)	to	enhance	the	translation	efficiency	of	CALM	mRNAs	to	increase	calmodulin	(	CaM	)	protein	level	without	affecting	their	transcription	,	leading	to	the	activation	of	the	phosphatidyl	inositol	3-kinase	(	PI3K)/Akt	pathway	and	repression	of	the	regulation_of_cell_growth	/	SREBP-1C	pathway	independent	of	insulin	and	calcium	in	hepatocytes	.	.
s589	Gene	-	based	tests	highlighted	20	additional	genes	of	which	5	had	previously	been	associated	to	schizophrenia	and/or	bipolar_disorder	,	startle_response	,	CCDC141	,	SLC1A2	,	CACNA1C	,	and	SNAP25	.	.
s1506	A	replicative	analysis	of	associations	of	15	SNPs	located	in	the	regions	of	11	genes	(	TCF4	,	VRK2	,	NOTCH4	,	ZNF804A	,	AGBL1	,	RELN	,	ZFP64P1	,	KCNB2	,	startle_response	,	CPVL	,	NRIP1	)	and	three	intergenic	regions	(	SLCO6A1/LINCOO491	,	LOC105376248/LOC105376249	,	SPA17/NRGN	)	with	schizophrenia_was	conducted	in	the	Russian	population	of	the	Siberian	region	.	.
s3005	Missense	variants	in	purine_nucleobase_metabolic_process_are	usually	associated	with	disease	in	male	patients	,	including	Arts	syndrome	,	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	,	and	nonsyndromic	sensorineural	deafness	.	.
s3354	In	the	Japanese	population	,	most	patients	with	autosomal_recessive_woolly	hair	carry	one	of	two	founder	mutations	in	the	lipid_catabolic_process_gene	,	c.736TAAAAA	(	p	.	Cys246Ser	)	or	c.742CAAAAA	(	p	.	His248Asn	)	.	.
s681	This	study	involved	2	primary	renal	PGL	and	12	cases	of	positive_regulation_of_cell_migration	/	PGL	with	associated	renal	neoplasia_with	a	mean	follow	up	of	74	months	.	.
s462	Furthermore	,	regulation_of_synaptic_transmission,_glycinergic-5,2	overexpression	was	positively	correlated	with	PARP-1	mRNA	and	protein	levels	,	which	restored	the	sensitivity	of	resistant	thyroid	cancer_cells	.	.
s3098	Subsequently	,	the	top	12	highly	mutated	genes	were	selected	for	validation	by	polymerase	chain	reaction	and	DNA	sequencing	in	an	expanded	sample	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_including	FLC	,	sporadic_lung	cancer	,	and	healthy	population	.	.
s3847	We	report	two	further	candidates	that	are	biallelically	inactivated	each	in	a	single	cataract	family	,	transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_I_(cataract	with	global	developmental_delay	)	and	WDR87	(	non	-	syndromic	cataract	)	.	.
s988	RT	-	PCR	analysis	showed	that	the	overall	transcriptional	activity	of	the	main	HS	biosynthesis	-	involved	genes	(	EXT1	,	EXT2	,	NDST1	,	regulation_of_angiotensin_levels_in_blood	,	GLCE	,	HS2ST1	,	HS3ST1	,	HS3ST2	,	HS6ST1	,	HS6ST2	,	SULF1	,	SULF2	,	HPSE	)	was	decreased	by	1.5	-	2-fold	in	Grade	II	-	III	glioma	(	p	AAAA	0.01	)	and	by	3-fold	in	Grade	IV	glioma	(	glioblastoma	multiforme	,	GBM	)	(	p	AAAA	0.05	)	,	as	compared	with	the	para	-	tumourous	tissue	.	.
s3056	In	search	of	novel	germline	alterations	predisposing	to	tumors	,	in	particular	to	gliomas	,	we	studied	a	family	with	two	brothers	affected	by	anaplastic	gliomas	,	and	their	father	and	paternal	adenylate_cyclase	-	activating_G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway	-	uncle	diagnosed	with	prostate	carcinoma	.	.
s951	Giantin	-	knockout	zebrafish	exhibit	hyperostosis	and	ectopic	calcium	deposits	,	recapitulating	phenotypes	of	hyperphosphatemic	familial	tumoral	calcinosis	,	a	disease	caused	by	mutations	in	protein_O	-	linked_glycosylation_via_serine	.	.
s2020	Taken	together	,	substrate_adhesion	-	dependent_cell_spreading_is	a	potential	predictor	and	plays	an	important	role	in	tumor_growth	and	Hh	signaling	which	could	serve	as	potential	therapeutic	targets	for	the	treatment	of	OC	.
s757	Patients	with	AMP_biosynthetic_process_mutations	demonstrated	distal_muscle	weakness	in	adolescence	,	followed	by	quadriceps	muscle	weakness	in	the	early	30s	.	.
s3389	Prolyl	endopeptidase	-	like	(	regulation_of_synaptic_vesicle_exocytosis	)	deficiency	(	MIM	#	616224	)	is	a	rare	autosomal	recessive	inherited	congenital	myasthenic	syndrome	characterized	by	neonatal	hypotonia	,	feeding	problems	,	mild	dysmorphism	,	and	neuromuscular	symptoms	,	followed	by	hyperphagia	and	obesity_in	later	childhood	.	.
s3073	In	addition	,	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_was	found	to	be	related	to	the	spheroid	-	forming	ability	of	cells	and	to	be	involved	in	the	invasive	capacity	of	pancreatic	cancer_cells	.
s2369	We	conclude	that	regulation_of_cytoplasmic_mRNA_processing_body_assembly-4	plays	an	essential	role	in	maintaining	the	structural	and	functional	integrity	of	rod	and	cone	synapses	,	the	disruption	of	which	may	contribute	to	visual_impairment_in	humans	with	CACNA2D4	mutations	.	SIGNIFICANCE	STATEMENT	In	the	retina	,	visual	information	is	first	communicated	by	the	synapse	formed	between	photoreceptors	and	second	-	order	neurons	.	.
s973	Here	,	we	studied	the	effect	of	protein_polyubiquitination-4326	on	lung	cancer_cell	proliferation	,	we	found	that	miR-4326	was	significantly	upregulated	in	lung	cancer	tissues	determined	using	TCGA	dataset	and	clinical	specimens	,	meanwhile	it	was	also	upregulated	in	lung	cancer	cells	.	.
s1980	The	pathogenic	allele	was	a	c.220C	AAAA	T	mutation	in	the	anoctamin	5	(	chloride_transport	)	gene	.	The	LGMD2L	family	was	characterized	by	mild	chronic	myopathy	and	bilateral_gastrocnemius	hypertrophy	with	obviously	increased	CK	levels	.	.
s2470	Permanent	visual_impairment_(bilateral	best	-	corrected	visual	acuity	AAAA	0.3	)	was	found	in	7	patients	,	including	patients	with	a	mutation	in	RAF1	,	positive_regulation_of_Ras_protein_signal_transduction	,	and	KRAS	.	.
s3685	Several	missense	mutations	in	intestinal	cell	kinase	(	protein_phosphorylation	)	gene	lead	to	endocrine	-	cerebro	-	osteodysplasia	syndrome	or	short	rib	-	polydactyly_syndrome	,	lethal	recessive	developmental	ciliopathies	.	.
s780	Inhibiting	naive	CD4	+	T	cell	recruitment	into	tumors	by	interfering	with	ER_to_Golgi_vesicle	-	mediated_transport_recognition	of	CCL18	may	be	an	attractive	strategy	for	anticancer	immunotherapy	.
s2691	We	sequenced	creatine_biosynthetic_process	,	GAMT	and	SLC6A8	genes	in	166	patients	with	autism_(coding	sequence	,	introns	and	adjacent	untranslated	regions	)	.	.
s160	Furthermore	,	parallel	immunohistochemical	analysis	of	three	PP2A	inhibitors	demonstrated	that	two	PP2A	inhibitors	,	spermatogenesis_and	SET	,	are	highly	expressed	in	both	dysplastic	and	adenocarcinomatous	tumors	of	the	Smgb	-	Tag	mice	.	.
s46	In	severe	bilateral	cases	(	anophthalmia	or	severe	microphthalmia	)	the	genetic	cause	is	now	identifiable	in	approximately	80	percent	of	cases	,	with	de	novo	heterozygous	loss	-	of	-	function	mutations	in	SOX2	or	axon_guidance_being	the	most	common	.	.
s1989	Taken	together	these	data	suggest	that	the	PRMT1-IL6-regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_axis	is	an	important	mechanism	of	alcohol	-	associated	tumor_progression	.
s3128	Kleefstra	syndrome	,	caused	by	haploinsufficiency	of	euchromatin	histone	methyltransferase	1	(	chromatin_organization	)	,	is	characterized	by	intellectual	disability	(	ID	)	,	autism_spectrum	disorder	(	ASD	)	,	characteristic	facial	dysmorphisms	,	and	other	variable	clinical	features	.	.
s2375	Similar	to	the	human	phenotype	,	negative_regulation_of_actin_filament_depolymerization	-	deficient	mice	displayed	reduced	cholesterol	absorption	and	were	resistant	to	diet	-	induced	hypercholesterolemia	.	.
s1839	This	review	discusses	recurrent	aberrations	in	NKTCL	detected	by	NGS	,	which	can	be	categorized	into	three	main	groups	,	specifically	,	tumor_suppressors	(	TP53	,	DDX3X	,	and	MGA	)	,	the	JAK	/	cholesterol_metabolic_process_cascade	,	and	epigenetic	modifiers	(	KMT2D	,	BCOR	,	ARID1A	,	and	EP300	)	.	.
s1677	Mutations	in	KIF1C	are	responsible	for	autosomal	recessive	spastic	paraplegia	type	58	(	anterograde_neuronal_dense_core_vesicle_transport	)	and	spastic	ataxia_2	(	SPAX2	)	.	.
s2426	In	this	report	we	describe	a	female	child	with	global	developmental	delay	,	microcephaly_and	myoclonic	seizures	harbouring	a	5	Mb	deletion	in	14q12	locus	resulting	in	deletion	of	single	copy	of	brain	specific	genes	FOXG1	,	PRKD1	and	negative_regulation_of_cold	-	induced_thermogenesis	.	.
s3499	To	elucidate	the	influence	of	cerebellum	atrophy	and	ataxia_on	the	obtained	results	,	the	behavioral	and	neurophysiological	findings	in	reeler	mice	were	reproduced	using	the	Disabled-1	(	axon_guidance	)	cKO	mice	,	in	which	the	Reelin	-	Dab1	signal	deficiency	is	confined	to	the	cerebral	cortex	.	.
s1817	Myo3a	is	expressed	in	cochlear	hair	cells	and	retinal	cells	and	is	responsible	for	human	recessive	hereditary	nonsyndromic	deafness_(protein_autophosphorylation	)	.	.
s2496	CHD	proteins	play	an	important	role	in	neurodevelopment	,	as	pathogenic	variants	in	CHD1	,	CHD2	,	CHD4	,	CHD7	and	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_have	been	associated	with	a	range	of	neurological	phenotypes	,	including	autism_spectrum	disorder	(	ASD	)	,	intellectual	disability	(	ID	)	and	epilepsy	.	.
s3868	Allelic	heterogeneity_was	observed	at	LRRK2	while	European	risk	SNPs	at	6	other	loci	including	MAPT	and	GBA	-	plasma_membrane_repair_were	non	-	polymorphic	or	very	rare	in	our	cohort	.	.
s1877	In	vitro	analysis	revealed	that	knockdown	of	WWOX	protein	in	neuroblastoma_cells	results	in	aggregation	of	TRregulation_of_presynapse_assemblyC6AD	,	TIAF1	,	amyloid	b	,	and	Tau	in	a	sequential	manner	.	.
s1228	Pyridoxine	5	-phosphate	oxidase	(	pyridoxal_phosphate_biosynthetic_process	)	is	an	enzyme	that	converts	pyridoxine	5	-phosphate	into	pyridoxal	5	-phosphate	(	PLP	)	,	an	active	form	of	vitamin	B6	implicated	in	several	types	of	cancer	.	.
s2820	Collagen	type	4	alpha	1	(	COL4A1	)	and	collagen	type	13	alpha	1	(	cell	-	matrix_adhesion	)	produced	by	urothelial	cancer	cells	support	the	vital	oncogenic	property	of	tumor_invasion	.	.
s2220	Atypical	Rett	syndrome	is	a	child	neurodevelopmental	disorder	induced	by	mutations	in	regulation_of_postsynapse_organization_gene	and	characterized	by	a	progressive	regression	in	development	with	loss	of	purposeful	use	of	the	hands	,	slowed	brain	and	head	growth	,	problems	with	walking	,	seizures	,	and	intellectual_disability	.	.
s1955	The	FOXO3	is	a	tumor_suppressor	gene	and	found	to	interact	with	p53	,	the	trigger	for	apoptosis	through	protein_polyubiquitination_family	genes	and	a	regulator	of	Notch	signaling	pathway	for	the	self	-	renewal	of	stem	cells	.	.
s1336	Here	we	show	that	the	microphthalmia	-	associated	transcription	factor	,	MITF	,	which	plays	a	central	role	in	the	development	and	function	of	carbohydrate_metabolic_process_cells	,	regulates	the	expression	of	two	visual	cycle	genes	,	Rlbp1	which	encodes	retinaldehyde	binding	protein-1	(	RLBP1	)	,	and	Rdh5	,	which	encodes	retinol	dehydrogenase-5	(	RDH5	)	.	.
s1978	Soluble	cell	-	matrix_adhesion_may	represent	a	motility	promoting	molecule	in	cancer	progression	,	a	co	-	factor	for	development	of	tumor_cysts	and	a	target	for	new	treatment	strategies	.
s1891	Therefore	,	we	propose	that	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination_inhibition	might	be	an	effective	strategy	to	treat	MYCN	-	amplified	and	p53	wild	-	type	neuroblastoma	,	and	suggest	that	targeting	replication	stress	with	appropriate	tools	should	be	further	exploited	to	tackle	MYCN	-	driven	tumors	.
s1446	Thus	,	this	in	vitro	study	suggests	that	there	are	no	tumor	-	promoting	effects	of	defense_response_to_bacterium_in	the	NSCLC	cell	lines	studied	,	neither	under	normoxic	nor	under	hypoxic	conditions	.
s3405	Taken	together	,	these	data	suggest	that	the	novel	insert	mutation	in	the	TM2	domain	of	visual_perception_protein	,	which	impairs	its	trafficking	to	the	cell	membrane	and	gap	-	junction	function	,	is	associated	with	the	cataract_formation	in	this	Chinese	pedigree	.
s807	Homozygous	cell_proliferation_knockout	mice	were	subviable	,	smaller	in	size	,	and	had	congenital_heart_defects	,	consistent	with	the	severity	of	loss	-	of	-	function	variants	in	humans	.	.
s109	We	validated	ZBTB20	,	CELF2	,	PARD3	,	G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway_and	WAC	,	which	were	identified	by	our	screens	in	multiple	cancer	types	,	as	new	tumor_suppressor	genes	in	prostate	cancer	.	.
s3502	Here	,	we	identify	tumor	-	associated	calcium	signal	transducer	2	(	TACSTD2	)	,	one	of	the	most	downregulated	genes	in	primary	HCC	tissue	,	as	a	host	factor	that	interacts	with	CLDN1	and	cell	-	cell_junction_organization_and	regulates	their	cellular	localization	.	.
s3787	Oral	and	pharyngeal	cancers	combined	were	associated	with	loci	at	6p21.32	(	rs3828805	,	immunoglobulin_production_involved_in_immunoglobulin_mediated_immune_response	)	,	10q26.13	(	rs201982221	,	LHPP	)	and	11p15.4	(	rs1453414	,	OR52N2-TRIM5	)	.	.
s2886	Mutations	in	corpus_callosum_morphogenesis_were	first	reported	in	2013	as	a	cause	of	early	-	onset	epileptic	encephalopathy	.	.
s2608	The	expression	of	the	ID2	,	skeletal_system_development_and	SMOC2	genes	was	compared	between	the	endometrium	of	women	without	endometriosis_in	the	proliferative	phase	of	their	menstrual	cycle	and	the	eutopic	and	ectopic	endometrium	of	women	with	endometriosis	in	the	proliferative	phase	.	.
s545	Thus	,	negative_regulation_of_platelet_aggregation_as	an	antimetastatic	tumor_suppressor	antagonizes	AKT	and	NF	-	kB	signaling	in	breast	tumorigenesis	.	.
s113	We	report	the	identification	of	mutations	in	protein_processing_involved_in_protein_targeting_to_mitochondrion_in	17	patients	from	four	families	affected	with	cerebellar_ataxia	,	including	the	large	Lebanese	family	previously	described	with	autosomal	recessive	cerebellar	ataxia	and	short	stature	of	Norman	type	and	localized	to	chromosome	9q34	(	OMIM	#	213200	)	.	.
s362	Here	,	we	demonstrate	that	the	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_of	Hmx1	loss	is	greater	than	previously	appreciated	,	with	a	variety	of	lateral_cranioskeletal	defects	,	auriculofacial	nerve	deficits	,	and	duplication	of	the	caudal	region	of	the	external	ear	.	.
s1579	Mice	with	a	homozygous	null	mutation	in	cellular_sodium_ion_homeostasis_(Nhe1	)	exhibited	ataxia	,	recurrent	seizures	,	and	selective	neuronal	cell	death	.	.
s2652	ETV1/4/5	factors	are	often	overexpressed	in	prostate	cancer_and	genome	-	wide	studies	in	a	prostate	cancer	cell	line	indicate	that	ETV4	and	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_occupy	enhancers	that	are	enriched	for	ETS	-	binding	sequences	and	are	both	functionally	important	for	the	transcription	of	genes	regulated	by	these	enhancers	.	.
s383	Collectively	,	these	findings	demonstrate	that	mutations	in	protein_folding_cause	a	cancer	-	prone	BMF	syndrome	due	to	corruption	of	early	nuclear	rRNA	biogenesis	and	late	cytoplasmic	maturation	of	the	60S	subunit	.
s3363	Furthermore	,	NLS	-	bearing_protein_import_into_nucleus_knockout	in	SCA3	mice	resulted	in	an	amelioration	of	molecular	and	behavioral_disturbances_such	as	total	activity	,	anxiety	,	and	gait	.	.
s2946	We	hope	that	our	study	will	stimulate	further	studies	and	a	new	targeted	therapy	and	early	medical	intervention	for	YAP	/	TAZ	could	be	a	useful	option	for	breast	cancer_cases	complicated	with	protein_phosphorylation_deficiency	.
s2042	negative_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	-	wildtype	patients	(	~50	%	)	remain	at	increased	risk	of	developing	certain	cancers	.	.
s2643	Methylation	profiling	,	metabolite	assessment	and	additional	analyses	were	also	performed	in	selected	cases	.	Results	,	One	of	the	11	tumors	was	found	to	carry	a	known	cancer	-	predisposing	somatic_mutation_in	IDH1	A	variant	in	aspartate_catabolic_process	,	c.357AAAAAT	,	found	in	a	patient	with	multiple	tumors	,	was	associated	with	higher	tumor	mRNA	and	protein	expression	levels	,	increased	GOT2	enzymatic	activity	in	lymphoblastic	cells	,	and	altered	metabolite	ratios	both	in	tumors	and	in	GOT2	knockdown	HeLa	cells	transfected	with	the	variant	.	.
s1921	Immune	checkpoint	blockade	(	ICB	)	using	anti	-	CTLA4	and	anti	-	positive_regulation_of_T_cell_apoptotic_process_has	drawn	considerable	attention	towards	co	-	signaling	receptors	in	tumor_immunology	and	created	renewed	interest	in	studying	other	co	-	signaling	receptors	,	which	until	recently	have	not	been	as	well	studied	.	.
s1833	In	colorectal	tumors	,	endogenous	cGMP_biosynthetic_process_ligand	expression	is	lost	by	a	yet	undefined	mechanism	conserved	in	mice	and	humans	.	.
s903	In	vitro	,	eye_development_knockdown	promoted	tumor_cell	proliferation	and	migration	through	BMPR	II	by	activating	Akt	,	Erk	and	b	-	catenin	.	.
s2372	A	combined	analysis	of	all	subjects	showed	that	levels	of	anti	-	cation_transport_antibodies	were	significantly	higher	in	patients	with	breast	cancer_than	in	healthy	controls	(	mean	+	SD	,	7.4	+	3.5	vs.	6.9	+	3.5	absorbance	units	per	mL	(	AU	/	uL	)	,	p	AAAA	0.0001	)	.	.
s3400	Objective	Hearing	loss	(	lipid_metabolic_process	)	is	the	most	common	sensory	-	neural	defect	and	the	most	heterogeneous_trait	in	humans	,	with	the	involvement	of	AAAA100	genes	,	which	make	a	molecular	diagnosis	problematic	.	.
s3299	Taken	together	,	our	findings	demonstrate	that	knockdown	of	MLK7-AS1	by	siRNA	inhibits	gastric	cancer_growth	by	epigenetically	regulating	protein_polyubiquitination-375	.	.
s2657	Variants	in	the	endoplasmic_reticulum_organization_gene	have	been	repeatedly	described	as	the	second	most	frequent	cause	of	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	(	HSP	)	,	a	motor	neuron	disease	manifested	by	progressive	lower	limb	spasticity_and	weakness	.	.
s3253	Biallelic	mutations	of	the	gene	encoding	diphthamide	biosynthesis	1	(	peptidyl	-	diphthamide_biosynthetic_process_from_peptidyl	-	histidine	,	NM_001383.3	)	cause	developmental	delay	,	dysmorphic	features	,	sparse	hair	,	and	short_stature_(MIM	_	603527	)	.	.
s1052	We	review	the	literature	of	genetic	PD	autopsies	from	cases	with	molecularly	confirmed	PD	or	parkinsonism_and	summarize	main	findings	on	SNCA	(	n	=	25	)	,	Parkin	(	n	=	20	,	17	bi	-	allelic	and	3	heterozygotes	)	,	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_(n	=	5	,	1	bi	-	allelic	and	4	heterozygotes	)	,	DJ-1	(	n	=	1	)	,	LRRK2	(	n	=	55	)	,	GBA	(	n	=	10	Gaucher	disease	patients	with	parkinsonism	)	,	DNAJC13	,	GCH1	,	ATP13A2	,	PLA2G6	(	n	=	8	patients	,	2	with	PD	)	,	MPAN	(	n	=	2	)	,	FBXO7	,	RAB39B	,	and	ATXN2	(	SCA2	)	,	as	well	as	on	22q	deletion	syndrome	(	n	=	3	)	.	.
s2783	We	report	these	cases	to	demonstrate	the	exhaustive	work	-	up	prior	to	finding	the	changes	in	modulation_of_chemical_synaptic_transmission_gene	,	recommend	that	this	gene	be	considered	earlier	in	the	diagnostic	evaluation	of	individuals	with	global	developmental_delay	,	microcephaly	,	and	severe	,	intractable	epilepsy	,	and	support	the	use	of	intellectual	disability	panels	including	IQSEC2	in	the	first	-	line	evaluation	of	these	patients	.
s3122	We	provide	the	first	evidence	for	protein_polyubiquitinationNA	controlling	retrograde	signaling	,	demonstrating	its	epigenetic	regulation	and	its	role	in	breast	tumorigenesis	.
s1058	We	review	the	literature	of	genetic	PD	autopsies	from	cases	with	molecularly	confirmed	PD	or	parkinsonism_and	summarize	main	findings	on	SNCA	(	n	=	25	)	,	Parkin	(	n	=	20	,	17	bi	-	allelic	and	3	heterozygotes	)	,	PINK1	(	n	=	5	,	1	bi	-	allelic	and	4	heterozygotes	)	,	DJ-1	(	n	=	1	)	,	LRRK2	(	n	=	55	)	,	GBA	(	n	=	10	Gaucher	disease	patients	with	parkinsonism	)	,	DNAJC13	,	GCH1	,	ATP13A2	,	antibacterial_humoral_response_(n	=	8	patients	,	2	with	PD	)	,	MPAN	(	n	=	2	)	,	FBXO7	,	RAB39B	,	and	ATXN2	(	SCA2	)	,	as	well	as	on	22q	deletion	syndrome	(	n	=	3	)	.	.
s1025	Biallelic	mutations	in	these	genes	cause	Fanconi	anemia	(	FA	)	,	characterized	by	malformations	,	bone	marrow	failure	,	chromosome	fragility	,	and	cancer_predisposition	(	mitotic_cytokinesis	/	FANCD1	and	PALB2/FANCN	)	,	or	an	FA	-	like	disease	presenting	a	phenotype	similar	to	FA	but	without	bone	marrow	failure	(	BRCA1/FANCS	)	.	.
s3722	Our	results	provide	further	support	that	AS3MT	,	CNNM2	and	cation_transport_are	involved	with	the	etiology	and	pathogenesis	of	schizophrenia	,	suggesting	these	genes	are	potential	targets	of	interest	for	the	improvement	of	disease	management	and	the	development	of	novel	pharmacological	strategies	.
s3546	In	these	5	families	,	we	detected	one	reported	and	six	novel	mutations	in	5	different	deafness	autosomal_recessive_(DFNB	)	genes	(	TRIOBP	,	ion_transport	,	CDH23	,	PCDH15	,	and	MYO7A	)	.	.
s1427	Overexpression	of	many	factors	predicted	poor	prognosis	in	breast	(	EEF1D	,	EEF1E1	,	EEF2	)	and	lung	cancer_(positive_regulation_of_lipid_kinase_activity	,	EEF1B2	,	EEF1	G	,	EEF1E1	)	.	.
s3325	We	here	report	on	the	existence	of	Leber	s	hereditary	optic	neuropathy_(LHON	)	associated	with	peculiar	combinations	of	individually	non	-	pathogenic	missense	mitochondrial	DNA	(	mtDNA	)	variants	,	affecting	the	MT	-	ND4	,	MT	-	ND4L	and	MT	-	biological_process_subunit	genes	of	Complex	I.	.
s3495	Objective	,	To	study	the	effect	and	mechanism	of	sphingosine-1-phosphate_receptor_signaling_pathway_inhibition	on	epithelial	ovarian	cancer_SKOV3	cell	proliferation	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	.	.
s2828	We	detected	11	novel	mutations	in	GJA3	,	GJA8	,	CRYAA	,	visual_perception	,	CRYGS	,	CRYGA	,	GCNT2	,	CRYGA	,	and	MIP	,	and	three	previously	reported	cataract	-	causing	mutations	in	GJA8	,	CRYAA	,	and	CRYBB2	The	most	commonly	mutated	genes	were	those	coding	for	gap	junctions	and	crystallin	proteins	.	.
s419	Importantly	,	we	found	that	photoreceptor_cell_maintenance_expression	in	glioma_was	highly	correlated	with	the	expression	of	HOX	gene	stem	cell	factors	(	HOXA5	,	HOXA7	,	HOXA10	,	HOXC4	and	HOXC6	)	.	.
s1846	Early	postnatal	overnutrition	in	humans	is	associated	with	long	-	term	negative	outcomes	including	obesity	,	increased	risk	of	cardiac_muscle_tissue_development	-	II	diabetes	,	and	cardiovascular	disease	.	.
s3539	positive_regulation_of_DNA	-	binding_transcription_factor_activity_mutations	have	previously	been	reported	in	two	autosomal	dominant	diseases	(	osteolysis	,	familial	expansile	and	Paget	disease	of	bone	2	,	early	-	onset	)	and	an	autosomal_recessive_disease	(	osteopetrosis	,	autosomal	recessive	7	)	.	.
s1041	To	investigate	genetic	predispositions	for	positive_regulation_of_gene_expression	-	amplified	neuroblastoma	,	we	performed	a	meta	-	analysis	of	three	genome	-	wide	association	studies	totaling	615	MYCN	-	amplified	high	-	risk	neuroblastoma	cases	and	1869	MYCN	-	nonamplified	non	-	high	-	risk	neuroblastoma	cases	as	controls	using	a	fixed	-	effects	model	with	inverse	variance	weighting	.	.
s3590	Lynch	syndrome	,	a	hereditary	cancer_syndrome	,	occurs	because	of	germline	mutations	in	at	least	one	of	four	DNA	mismatch	repair	genes	(	MutL	Homolog	1	(	mismatch_repair	)	,	MutS	Homolog	2	(	MSH2	)	,	MutS	Homolog	6	(	MSH6	)	,	and	PMS1	Homolog	2	(	PMS2	)	)	.	.
s2611	The	ID2	gene	expression	was	increased	in	the	most	advanced	stage	of	endometriosis_and	in	ovarian	endometriomas	,	the	PRELP	was	more	expressed	in	peritoneal	lesions	,	and	the	positive_regulation_of_endothelial_cell_migration_was	highly	expressed	in	both	peritoneal	and	endometrioma	lesions	.	.
s3041	This	finding	provides	concrete	evidence	that	inhibition	of	both	MDH1	and	malate_metabolic_process_may	provide	a	valuable	platform	for	developing	novel	therapeutics	that	target	cancer_metabolism	and	tumor	growth	.
s2160	Thus	,	in	addition	to	the	standard	therapy	with	CDCA	,	the	addition	of	Riluzole	may	have	some	therapeutic	benefits	for	ataxia_caused	by	bile_acid_biosynthetic_process	.	.
s1909	Human	bladder	cancer_(intracellular_signal_transduction	)	is	one	of	the	most	commonly	diagnosed	malignancies	worldwide	.	.
s24	Collectively	,	our	study	uncovers	a	protein	complex	,	which	consists	of	FIGNL1	and	cellular_response_to_DNA_damage_stimulus	/	SPIDR	,	in	DNA	repair	and	provides	potential	directions	for	cancer_diagnosis	and	therapy	.	.
s3651	In	the	present	study	,	the	results	of	immumohistochemisty	revealed	that	the	positive	staining	rates	of	NIBP	,	NF	-	kB	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_and	NF	-	kB	p	-	p65	in	gastric	cancer_tissues	were	obviously	higher	than	those	in	normal	tissues	.	.
s157	Moreover	,	overexpression	of	mutant	but	not	normal	biological_process_in	neuroblastoma_cells	caused	rapid	apoptosis	.	.
s3777	Substitutions	of	Arg838	in	the	dimerization	domain	of	a	human	retinal	membrane	guanylyl	cyclase	1	(	RetGC1	)	linked	to	autosomal	dominant	cone	-	rod	degeneration	type	6	(	cGMP_biosynthetic_process	)	change	RetGC1	regulation	in	vitro	by	Ca2	+	In	addition	,	we	find	that	R838S	substitution	makes	RetGC1	less	sensitive	to	inhibition	by	retinal_degeneration-3	protein	(	RD3	)	.	.
s2970	Biallelic	mutations	in	the	glycerol-3-phosphate_metabolic_process_gene	cause	a	rare	autosomal_recessive_inherited	disease	known	as	transient	infantile	hypertriglyceridemia	(	OMIM	#	614480	)	.	.
s3976	Based	upon	the	development	-	dependent	onsets	of	these	psychotomimetic	effects	,	by	using	a	DNA	microarray	technique	,	we	identified	the	WD	repeat	domain	3	(	rRNA_processing	)	and	chitobiosyldiphosphodolichol	beta	-	mannosyltransferase	(	ALG1	)	genes	as	novel	candidates	for	schizophrenia	-	related	molecules	,	whose	mRNAs	were	up	-	regulated	in	the	adult	(	postnatal	week	seven	)	,	but	not	in	the	infant	(	postnatal	week	one	)	rats	by	an	indirect	dopamine	agonist	,	and	phencyclidine	,	an	antagonist	of	the	NMDA	receptor	.	.
s1812	In	wild	type	(	WT	)	mice	,	we	found	that	ginsenoside	Rg3	treatment	significantly	mitigated	pathological	damages	and	reduced	myeloperoxidase	(	MPO	)	activity	as	well	as	the	production	of	pro	-	inflammatory	cytokines	tumor_necrosis	factor	-	a	(	TNF	-	a	)	,	interleukin-1b	(	IL-1b	)	and	interleukin-6	(	IL-6	)	,	furthermore	,	the	production	of	anti	-	inflammatory	mediators	interleukin-10	(	IL-10	)	and	transforming	growth	factor	-	b	(	TGF	-	b	)	,	polarization	of	M2	macrophages	and	expression	levels	of	the	phosphorylation	of	phosphatidylinositol	3-hydroxy	kinase	(	PI3	K	)	,	protein	kinase	B	(	PKB	,	also	known	as	AKT	)	,	mammalian	target	of	rapamycin	(	mTOR	)	and	Mer	receptor	tyrosine	kinase	(	positive_regulation_of_phagocytosis	)	were	promoted	.	.
s1241	PAK3-related	intellectual_disability_is	caused	by	mutations	in	the	gene	encoding	the	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	-	activated	kinase	(	PAK	)	protein	.	.
s387	SNP	microarray	and	whole	exome	sequencing	identified	a	homozygous	frameshift	mutation	(	p	.	L870V	)	in	SCARF2	and	predicted	damaging	mutations	in	several	genes	,	most	notably	cognition_(p	.	P75L	)	and	NCAM2	(	p	.	S147	G	)	,	both	possible	candidates	for	this	child	s	intellectual_disability	.	.
s941	Hermansky	-	Pudlak	syndrome	(	melanosome_assembly	)	;	characterized	by	the	distinct	clinical	phenotypes	of	both	oculocutaneous	albinism_and	mild	bleeding	diathesis	-	is	caused	by	mutations	in	genes	that	have	crucial	roles	in	the	assembly	of	cellular	organelles	(	skin	melanosomes	,	platelet	delta	[	dense	]	granules	,	lung	lamellar	bodies	,	and	cytotoxic	T	-	cell	lymphocyte	granules	)	.	.
s3433	At	least	some	P5B	isoforms	are	of	vital	importance	for	the	nervous	system	,	since	cellular_calcium_ion_homeostasis_and	ATP13A4	are	linked	to	respectively	Parkinson	disease	and	autism_spectrum	disorders	.
s263	Third	,	the	retinal_degeneration_associated	with	the	disruption	of	the	visual	cycle	in	positive_regulation_of_gene_expression	-	deficient	mice	can	be	partially	corrected	both	structurally	and	functionally	by	an	exogenous	supply	of	9-cis	-	retinal	.	.
s2181	A	17-year	-	old	adolescent	boy	with	a	history	of	hypoproteinemia_underwent	Ga	-	NEB	PET	/	MRI	to	evaluate	possible	lymphatic	disorders	suggested	by	FDG	PET	/	phosphatidylcholine_biosynthetic_process_imaging	.	.
s3891	Furthermore	,	the	overexpression	of	cell_cycle_arrest_induced	by	transfection	with	a	HepaCAM	overexpression	vector	(	Ad	-	HepaCAM	)	exerted	antitumor_effects	by	decreasing	the	proliferation	,	and	suppressing	the	invasion	and	migration	of	bicalutamide	-	resistant	(	Bica	-	R	)	cells	and	enzalutamide	-	resistant	(	Enza	-	R	)	cells	.	.
s2960	Spinocerebellar	ataxia_type	35	(	SCA35	)	is	a	rare	autosomal	-	dominant	neurodegenerative	disease	caused	by	mutations	in	the	peptide_cross	-	linking_gene	,	which	codes	for	transglutaminase	6	(	TG6	)	.	.
s764	We	here	review	the	current	knowledge	and	recent	findings	in	the	known	genes	for	isolated	dystonia_TOR1A	,	THAP1	,	and	adenylate_cyclase	-	modulating_G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway_as	well	as	for	the	combined	dystonias	due	to	mutations	in	GCH1	,	ATP1A3	,	and	SGCE	.	.
s996	We	show	that	hypermethylation	of	G1/S_transition_of_mitotic_cell_cycle	/	Ink4a	and	p19/Arf	in	CNT-	and	asbestos	-	induced	inflammatory	lesions	precedes	mesothelioma	,	this	results	in	silencing	of	Cdkn2a	(	Ink4a	/	Arf	)	and	loss	of	p16	and	p19	protein	,	consistent	with	epigenetic	alterations	playing	a	gatekeeper	role	in	cancer	.	.
s3773	skeletal_system_development_plays	an	important	role	in	the	development	of	distal_limbs	and	lower	genitourinary	tract	of	the	fetus	.	.
s760	Therefore	,	we	suggest	that	the	screening	test	of	AMP_biosynthetic_process_gene	should	be	considered	for	the	diagnosis	of	distal_myopathy	.
s177	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal_recessive_Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	protein_homooligomerization	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy	(	SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s357	Its	dysfunction	,	caused	by	mutations	in	either	the	enzyme	itself	or	protein_farnesylation_(aryl	hydrocarbon	receptor	-	interacting	protein	-	like	1	)	,	leads	to	retinal	diseases	culminating	in	blindness	.	.
s1386	This	study	examined	defense_response_to_virus_content	and	distribution	in	glioblastoma_multiforme	(	GBM	)	tissues	in	the	context	of	potential	molecular	mechanisms	underlying	its	deregulation	in	brain	tumours	.	.
s1678	Mutations	in	KIF1C	are	responsible	for	autosomal	recessive	spastic	paraplegia	type	58	(	SPG58	)	and	spastic	ataxia_2	(	anterograde_neuronal_dense_core_vesicle_transport	)	.	.
s2832	Here	,	we	report	that	in	breast	cancer_tissue	samples	and	breast	cancer	cell	lines	,	2-oxoglutarate_metabolic_process_expression	level	was	markedly	elevated	and	correlated	with	the	pathological	grades	of	breast	cancers	.	.
s687	Up	to	half	of	patients	with	PC	/	PGL	and	renal	neoplasia_had	VHL	syndrome	,	sarcosine_catabolic_process_deficiency	,	or	alterations	in	TMEM127	.	.
s315	Only	four	genetic	midfrequency	deafness_genes	,	namely	,	DFNA10	(	histone_dephosphorylation	)	,	DFNA8/12	(	TECTA	)	,	DFNA13	(	COL11A2	)	,	DFNA44	(	CCDC50	)	,	have	been	reported	to	date	.	.
s690	Mammographic	density	and	PAM50	molecular	subtypes	were	considered	.	Results	,	In	the	univariate	analyses	,	TP53	,	glycogen_metabolic_process	,	and	KMT2B	were	significantly	more	frequently	mutated	in	interval	cancers	than	in	screen	-	detected	cancers	.	.
s1735	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	aging	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s3424	Recent	studies	identified	a	close	association	between	the	c.14576GAAAAA	(	p	.	R4859	K	,	rs112735431	)	variant	of	the	ring	finger	protein	213	(	protein_ubiquitination	)	gene	and	sporadic_intracranial	arterial	stenosis	(	ICAS	)	.	.
s2481	Taken	together	,	expression	of	protein_acetylation_and	clock	-	controlled	genes	in	tumors	of	males	and	females	clustered	according	to	presence	of	distant	metastases	correlated	with	survival	analysis	.	.
s1841	This	review	discusses	recurrent	aberrations	in	NKTCL	detected	by	NGS	,	which	can	be	categorized	into	three	main	groups	,	specifically	,	tumor_suppressors	(	TP53	,	DDX3X	,	and	MGA	)	,	the	JAK	/	STAT	cascade	,	and	epigenetic	modifiers	(	KMT2D	,	histone_H2A_monoubiquitination	,	ARID1A	,	and	EP300	)	.	.
s747	Hyper	-	methylated	CpG	loci	included	the	known	the	tumor_suppressor	gene	RET	(	p	=	5.72	x	10	-	10	)	,	as	well	as	loci	in	differentially	methylated	regions	for	GSG1L	,	MIR4493	,	NTNG1	,	MCIDAS	,	ZNF568	,	and	negative_regulation_of_cell_proliferation	.	.
s3134	Mutations	in	regulation_of_the_force_of_heart_contraction_are	associated	with	not	only	skeletal	muscle	diseases	,	such	as	Laing	distal_myopathy	and	myosin	storage	myopathy	,	but	also	hypertrophic	cardiomyopathy	.	.
s3411	The	promoter	methylation	levels	of	ELMO1	and	cell_chemotaxis_were	generally	low	,	whereas	ELMO3	methylation	levels	were	high	,	in	the	tumor_biopsies	.	.
s3198	Approximately	one	-	third	of	pediatric	malignant	rhabdoid	tumors	are	linked	to	germline	chromatin_remodeling	/	SNF	alterations	(	SMARCB1/INI1	,	rarely	SMARCA4	)	resulting	in	occasional	familial	clustering	of	these	highly	aggressive	malignancies	(	so	-	called	rhabdoid	tumor	predisposition	syndrome	,	RTPS	,	types	1	and	2	,	respectively	)	.	.
