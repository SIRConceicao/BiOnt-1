s3250	The	aim	of	the	study	was	to	characterize	the	prolyl	-	tRNA_aminoacylation-	related	phenotype	.	Three	siblings	with	biallelic	PARS2	mutations	presented	from	birth	with	infantile	spasms	,	secondary	microcephaly	,	and	similar	facial	dysmorphy	.	.
s2527	Fully	activated	YAP	is	required	to	support	the	growth	in	protein_phosphorylation	-	knockout	colon	cancer_cells	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	.	.
s1246	A	common	form	of	hereditary	autosomal	dominant	demyelinating	neuropathy_known	as	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	type	1A	(	CMT1A	)	is	linked	with	duplication	of	the	peripheral	myelin	protein	22	(	biological_process	)	gene	.	.
s162	Here	,	we	identify	new	patients	with	dextrocardia_who	have	mutations	in	determination_of_left	/	right_symmetry	,	a	coiled	-	coil	domain	containing	protein	.	.
s2005	Therefore	,	the	current	study	specifically	investigated	bone	cell	activity	in	clinical	bone	metastases	in	relation	to	tumor_cell	oxidation	-	reduction_process_activity	,	in	order	to	gain	novel	insight	into	biological	heterogeneities	of	possible	importance	for	patient	stratification	into	bone	-	targeting	therapies	.	.
s153	Two	recent	reports	describe	a	new	syndrome	of	intellectual	disability	,	short	stature	,	microcephaly	,	and	young	onset	diabetes	or	disturbed	glucose	metabolism	in	association	with	inactivating	mutations	in	the	tRNA_methylation_gene	.	.
s1892	Therefore	,	we	propose	that	MRE11	inhibition	might	be	an	effective	strategy	to	treat	positive_regulation_of_gene_expression	-	amplified	and	p53	wild	-	type	neuroblastoma	,	and	suggest	that	targeting	replication	stress	with	appropriate	tools	should	be	further	exploited	to	tackle	MYCN	-	driven	tumors	.
s3445	Lack	-	of	-	function	mutations	in	deadenylation	-	independent_decapping_of_nuclear	-	transcribed_mRNA_were	detected	in	BRCA1/2-mutation	-	negative	breast	cancer_cases	,	suggesting	a	role	in	breast	cancer	susceptibility	.	.
s2282	Variants	of	WNK1	(	lysine	deficient	protein	kinase	1	)	,	ADRB2	(	b2	adrenergic	receptor	)	,	regulation_of_membrane_depolarization_(ubiquitin	-	protein	ligase	NEDD4-like	)	,	KLK1	(	kallikrein	1	)	contribute	to	hypertension	,	and	AKR1C3	(	aldo	-	keto	reductase	family1	member	C3	)	,	is	associated	with	preeclampsia	.	.
s3545	In	these	5	families	,	we	detected	one	reported	and	six	novel	mutations	in	5	different	deafness_autosomal	recessive	(	DFNB	)	genes	(	TRIOBP	,	LHFPL5	,	CDH23	,	sensory_perception_of_sound	,	and	MYO7A	)	.	.
s825	The	prognostic	significance	and	performance	of	PYCR1	mRNA	were	validated	on	13	worldwide	independent	microarray	data	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templateds	,	composed	of	2500	assessable	breast	cancer_cases	.	.
s1154	Collectively	,	our	data	suggest	that	plus	-	end	-	directed_vesicle_transport_along_microtubule_regulates	MB	degradation	,	and	we	present	the	first	evidence	that	cancer_invasiveness	is	a	feature	that	can	be	modulated	by	the	accumulation	of	MBs	in	cancer	stem	cells	.	This	article	has	an	associated	First	Person	interview	with	the	first	author	of	the	paper	.
s2602	Oral	and	pharyngeal	cancers	combined	were	associated	with	loci	at	6p21.32	(	rs3828805	,	HLA	-	DQB1	)	,	10q26.13	(	rs201982221	,	LHPP	)	and	11p15.4	(	rs1453414	,	G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway	-	TRIM5	)	.	.
s3048	hemopoiesis_fusions	are	associated	with	myeloid	and	lymphoid	neoplasms	with	eosinophilia	.	.
s3206	An	inverse	correlation	between	the	expression	levels	of	human	Nanos1	and	negative_regulation_of_translation_and	E	-	cadherin	was	observed	in	several	cancer_cell	lines	.	.
s2040	Patients	with	heritable	cancer_syndromes	characterized	by	germline	negative_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_mutations	(	termed	PTEN	hamartoma	tumor	syndrome	,	PHTS	)	benefit	from	PTEN	-	enabled	cancer	risk	assessment	and	clinical	management	.	.
s4080	In	conclusion	,	our	study	identified	four	circulating	protein_polyubiquitinationNAs	that	were	influenced	by	variation	in	hyperglycemia	.	.
s1321	Fourteen	different	(	half	of	them	novel	)	non	-	GJB2	variants	causing	HL	were	found	in	10	genes	(	CHD7	,	HDAC8	,	MITF	,	NEFL	,	OTOF	,	SF3B4	,	regulation_of_pH	,	TECTA	,	TMPRSS3	,	USH2A	)	among	13	probands	,	confirming	the	genetic	heterogeneity_of	hereditary	HL	.	.
s3767	The	deficiency	of	3-methycrotonyl	-	CoA	carboxylase	(	3-establishment_of_protein_localization	,	EC	6.4.1.4	)	is	an	autosomal	recessive	organic_aciduria_that	is	included	in	the	newborn	screening	programs	of	several	countries	.	.
s361	Here	,	we	demonstrate	that	the	impact	of	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_loss	is	greater	than	previously	appreciated	,	with	a	variety	of	lateral_cranioskeletal	defects	,	auriculofacial	nerve	deficits	,	and	duplication	of	the	caudal	region	of	the	external	ear	.	.
s3276	Then	,	the	role	of	fat_cell_differentiation_in	migration	and	proliferation	of	glioma_cells	was	investigated	by	conducting	wound	-	healing	,	trans	-	well	assay	,	cell	counting	kit	(	CCK)-8	,	flow	cytometry	assay	and	colony	formation	analysis	.	.
s591	Gene	-	based	tests	highlighted	20	additional	genes	of	which	5	had	previously	been	associated	to	schizophrenia	and/or	bipolar_disorder	,	CSMD1	,	CCDC141	,	L	-	glutamate_transmembrane_transport	,	CACNA1C	,	and	SNAP25	.	.
s424	photoreceptor_cell_maintenance_(p	=	0.021	)	and	HOXA7	(	p	=	0.001	)	were	independent	prognostic	markers	when	the	three	glioma_patient	cohorts	were	combined	(	n	=	231	)	.	.
s2385	Transcriptomics	revealed	that	102	genes	were	upregulated	and	85	genes	were	downregulated	in	hyaluronan_catabolic_process+Lin-	compared	to	CD44-Lin-	cells	in	at	least	3	of	the	5	tumours	sequenced	.	.
s3204	Beyond	neoplasms	,	several	congenital	developmental	functional	disorders	such	as	Coffin	-	Siris	syndrome	and	intellectual_disability_are	now	known	to	be	chromatin_remodeling	/	SNF	-	related	.	.
s1555	Among	those	with	peripheral_tumors	,	the	median	tumor	number	was	4	in	the	LZTR1	group	(	median	total	body	tumor	volume	30	cc	)	and	10	in	the	nucleosome_disassembly_group	(	median	volume	85cc	)	,	(	P=.2915	for	tumor	number	and	P	=	.2289	for	volume	)	.	.
s1580	In	humans	,	three	unrelated	patients	have	been	reported	,	a	patient	with	a	homozygous	missense	mutation	in	cellular_sodium_ion_homeostasis	,	c.913GAAAAA	(	p	.	Gly305Arg	)	,	which	caused	Lichtenstein	-	Knorr	syndrome	characterized	by	cerebellar	ataxia_and	sensorineural	hearing	loss	,	a	patient	with	compound	heterozygous	mutations	,	c.1351AAAAAC	(	p	.	Ile451Leu	)	and	c.1585CAAAAT	(	p	.	His529Tyr	)	,	which	caused	a	neuromuscular	disorder	,	and	a	patient	with	de	novo	mutation	,	c.796AAAAAC	(	p	.	Asn266His	)	which	associated	multiple	anomalies	.	.
s1019	PurposeMonoallelic	germ	-	line	mutations	in	the	BRCA1/double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination	,	BRCA2/FANCD1	and	PALB2/FANCN	genes	confer	high	risk	of	breast	cancer	.	.
s1166	Methods	,	Ten	potentially	functional	single	nucleotide	polymorphisms	(	SNPs	)	in	seven	prostate	CSC	marker	genes	,	TACSTD2	,	PROM1	,	ITGA2	,	POU5F1	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	PSCA	,	and	CD44	,	were	selected	for	analysis	of	their	association	with	disease	recurrence	by	Kaplan	-	Meier	analysis	and	Cox	regression	in	a	cohort	of	320	patients	with	localized	prostate	cancer_receiving	radical	prostatectomy	.	.
s697	Our	results	suggest	the	cg07814318	site	could	be	involved	in	orexigenic	processes	,	and	also	implicate	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_in	obesity	.	.
s2872	The	clinical	presentation	of	GPI_anchor_biosynthetic_process_varies	from	a	benign	asymptomatic	condition	to	rapidly	progressive	glomerulonephritis_requiring	dialysis	.	.
s1694	Exome	analysis	of	APA	has	allowed	the	identification	of	recurrent	somatic	mutations	in	KCNJ5	,	CACNA1D	,	ATP1A1	,	and	regulation_of_cytosolic_calcium_ion_concentration_in	more	than	50	%	of	sporadic_cases	.	.
s3810	The	tumor_cells	resembled	pro	-	B	cells	,	and	were	CD19+IgM	-	IgD	-	CD93+CD43+CD21-CD23-VpreB+CXCR4	+	Consistent	with	the	pro	-	B	-	cell	stage	of	B	-	cell	development	,	microarray	analysis	revealed	enrichment	of	transcripts	,	including	Rag1	,	Rag2	,	CD93	,	immunoglobulin_production	,	Vpreb3	,	and	Igll1	We	confirmed	RAG1	expression	in	Tg26	tumors	,	and	hypothesized	that	HIV-1	matrix	protein	p17	may	directly	induce	RAG1	in	B	cells	.	.
s2784	Hyperphosphatasia	with	mental	retardation	syndrome	(	HPMRS	)	is	caused	by	mutations	in	GPI_anchor_biosynthetic_process_and	includes	hyperphosphatasia_as	a	diagnostic	hallmark	.	.
s1289	Nevertheless	,	little	is	known	about	the	roles	of	cilium_assembly_in	cancer	.	.
s420	Importantly	,	we	found	that	CD133	expression	in	glioma_was	highly	correlated	with	the	expression	of	HOX	gene	stem	cell	factors	(	positive_regulation_of_receptor_biosynthetic_process	,	HOXA7	,	HOXA10	,	HOXC4	and	HOXC6	)	.	.
s1548	Hepatic	hnRNPA1	overexpression	also	activated	the	CaM	/	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_pathway	and	repressed	the	mTOR	/	SREBP-1C	pathway	to	ameliorate	hyperglycemia_and	steatosis	in	obese	mice	.	.
s3016	In	conclusion	,	autosomal	dominant	mutations	in	response_to_drug	,	a	key	member	of	the	cotranslation	protein	-	targeting	pathway	,	lead	to	syndromic	neutropenia_with	a	Shwachman	-	Diamond	-	like	phenotype	.
s2249	Furthermore	,	we	investigated	whether	there	is	an	association	between	the	mRNA	and	protein	expression	levels	of	RBCK1	,	protein_polyubiquitination_and	SHARPIN	and	clinicopathological	parameters	including	estrogen	receptor	(	ER	)	,	progesterone	receptor	(	PR	)	and	human	epidermal	growth	factor	receptor	(	HER2	)	status	and	found	that	RNF31	protein	is	significantly	higher	in	ERalpha	-	negative	tumors	than	ERalpha	-	positive	tumors	(	p	=	0.034	)	.	.
s958	We	compared	the	distribution	and	localization	of	UC	and	esterified	cholesterol	(	EC	)	,	the	age	-	related	macular_degeneration_(AMD	)	associated	EFEMP1/Fibulin3	(	Fib3	)	,	and	levels	of	acyl	-	coenzyme	A	(	CoA	)	,	cholesterol	acyltransferases	(	ACAT	)	ACAT1	,	ACAT2	and	Apolipoprotein	B	(	positive_regulation_of_macrophage_derived_foam_cell_differentiation	)	in	ARPE-19	cells	cultured	in	serum	-	supplemented	and	serum	-	free	media	.	.
s3567	Most	of	the	genes	that	are	commonly	associated	with	colon	cancer	,	including	cellular_response_to_DNA_damage_stimulus	,	TP53	,	and	KRAS	,	were	all	classified	as	being	early	driver	genes	being	mutated	in	both	adenomas	and	carcinomas	.	.
s3084	Codeletion	of	desensitization_of_G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway_by_arrestin_and	Cox10	,	a	gene	encoding	a	cytochrome	IV	oxidase	assembly	factor	,	prevented	the	metabolic	shift	induced	by	Adrb2	deletion	and	rescued	prostate	cancer_progression	.	.
s1412	We	further	report	that	genetic	or	pharmacological	inhibition	of	regulation_of_autophagy_considerably	reduces	MCL1	protein	abundance	and	significantly	increases	tumor_cell	sensitivity	to	BH3	mimetic	inhibitors	targeting	BCL-2	and	BCL	-	XL	.	.
s622	In	addition	,	we	found	that	eye_development_regulation	of	RAB3GAP1	,	RAB3GAP2	and	SNAP25	affects	secretion	of	Myocilin	(	MYOC	)	,	a	protein	associated	with	juvenile	onset	glaucoma_and	steroid	-	induced	glaucoma	.	.
s3190	Mutations	in	the	cellular_sodium_ion_homeostasis_gene	,	which	encodes	the	alpha3-subunit	of	sodium	-	potassium	ATPase	,	are	related	to	a	spectrum	of	neurological	diseases	including	Rapid	onset	Dystonia	-	Parkinsonism	(	RDP	)	,	Alternating	Hemiplegia	of	Childhood	(	AHC	)	and	Cerebellar	ataxia	,	Areflexia	,	Pes	cavus	,	Optic	atrophy	and	Sensorineural	hearing	loss	(	CAPOS	)	syndrome	.	.
s3534	We	found	that	intrinsic_apoptotic_signaling_pathway_in_response_to_oxidative_stress	,	combined	with	DDP	greatly	inhibited	proliferation	of	subcutaneous	xenografts	of	ovarian	cancer_cell	line	SKOV3/DDP	without	side	effects	.	.
s158	Our	genome	-	wide	study	showed	that	Ppp2r1b	,	a	PP2A	subunit	encoding	tumor_suppressor	gene	,	is	underexpressed	in	submandibular	gland	tumors	of	nuclear	-	transcribed_mRNA_poly(A)_tail_shortening	-	Tag	mice	.	.
s2429	In	this	report	we	describe	a	female	child	with	global	developmental	delay	,	microcephaly	and	myoclonic	seizures_harbouring	a	5	Mb	deletion	in	14q12	locus	resulting	in	deletion	of	single	copy	of	brain	specific	genes	FOXG1	,	PRKD1	and	negative_regulation_of_cold	-	induced_thermogenesis	.	.
s3581	With	a	feature	selection	algorithm	,	we	selected	a	panel	of	five	urinary	biomarkers	(	FTL	,	Ferritin	light	chain	,	MAPK1IP1L	,	Mitogen	-	Activated	Protein	Kinase	1	Interacting	Protein	1	Like	,	FGB	,	Fibrinogen	Beta	Chain	,	RAB33B	,	RAB33B	,	Member	RAS	Oncogene	Family	,	positive_regulation_of_regulated_secretory_pathway	,	RAB15	,	Member	RAS	Oncogene	Family	)	and	established	a	combinatorial	model	that	can	correctly	classify	the	majority	of	lung	cancer_cases	both	in	the	training	set	(	n=46	)	and	the	test	sets	(	n=14	-	47	per	set	)	with	an	AUC	ranging	from	0.8747	to	0.9853	.	.
s2250	Furthermore	,	we	investigated	whether	there	is	an	association	between	the	mRNA	and	protein	expression	levels	of	RBCK1	,	RNF31	and	regulation_of_tumor_necrosis_factor	-	mediated_signaling_pathway_and	clinicopathological	parameters	including	estrogen	receptor	(	ER	)	,	progesterone	receptor	(	PR	)	and	human	epidermal	growth	factor	receptor	(	HER2	)	status	and	found	that	RNF31	protein	is	significantly	higher	in	ERalpha	-	negative	tumors	than	ERalpha	-	positive	tumors	(	p	=	0.034	)	.	.
s36	Targeted	disruption	of	sensory_perception_of_sound_is	concurrently	reported	to	cause	hearing_loss_in	mice	.	.
s1098	The	most	important	parameters	to	consider	when	determining	arrhythmic	risk	include	electric	instability	,	including	the	frequency	of	premature	ventricular	contractions	and	sustained	ventricular_arrhythmia	,	proband	status	,	extent	of	structural	disease	,	cardiac	syncope	,	male	sex	,	the	presence	of	multiple	mutations	or	a	mutation	in	nuclear_membrane_organization	,	and	the	patient	s	willingness	to	restrict	exercise	and	to	eliminate	participation	in	competitive	or	endurance	exercise	.
s712	In	the	present	study	,	we	found	that	protein_K27-linked_ubiquitination_was	overexpressed	in	more	than	70	%	of	breast	cancer_tissues	and	it	was	associated	with	overall	survival	.	.
s212	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal	recessive	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy_(SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	bile_acid_metabolic_process	/	GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s2952	Loss	-	of	-	function	mutations	in	protein_dephosphorylation_cause	the	severe	congenital	myopathy_called	myotubular	myopathy	(	or	X	-	linked	centronuclear	myopathy	)	while	mutations	in	the	MTM1-related	protein	MTMR2	cause	a	recessive	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	peripheral	neuropathy	.	.
s2978	Further	,	immunohistochemistry	was	done	to	identify	mRNA_splicing,_via_spliceosome_expression	levels	in	various	cancers	and	its	association	with	tumor_angiogenesis	.	.
s3733	The	PCH1sub	-	types	with	early	death	(	between	ages	1	day	and	17	months	)	,	seen	in	patients	with	p	.	G31A	/	EXOSC3	or	mitochondrial_membrane_fission_mutations	have	a	SMA	type	1-like	clinical	presentation	but	with	global	developmental	delay	,	visual	and	hearing	impairment	,	with	or	without	microcephaly	,	nystagmus	and	optic_atrophy	.	.
s1371	Ellis	-	glycoprotein_biosynthetic_process_Creveld	syndrome	is	an	autosomal	recessive	skeletal	dysplasia	primarily	characterized	by	the	features	such	as	disproportionate	dwarfism	,	short	ribs	,	short	limbs	,	dysplastic	nails	,	cardiovascular	malformations	,	post	-	axial_polydactyly	(	PAP	)	(	bilateral	)	of	hands	and	feet	.	.
s3619	While	these	expansions	occur	in	coding	and	noncoding	regions	,	microsatellite	sequence	and	repeat	length	diversity	is	more	prominent	in	introns	with	eight	different	trinucleotide	to	hexanucleotide	repeats	,	causing	hereditary	diseases	such	as	myotonic	dystrophy	type	2	(	DM2	)	,	Fuchs	endothelial	corneal_dystrophy_(FECD	)	,	and	C9orf72	amyotrophic	lateral	sclerosis	and	frontotemporal	dementia	(	cell_killing	-	ALS	/	FTD	)	.	.
s1707	Lately	,	ARMC5	was	linked	to	the	cyclic	AMP	signaling	pathway	,	which	could	be	implicated	in	all	of	mechanisms	of	cortisol	-	secreting	by	macronodules	adrenal_hyperplasia_and	the	molecular	defects	in	,	G	protein	aberrant	receptors	,	MC2R	,	GNAS	,	PRKAR1A	,	PDE11A	,	G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway	.	.
s1395	This	chapter	focuses	on	the	current	data	covering	the	etiology	and	epidemiology	,	clinical	presentation	,	and	pathogenesis	of	four	monogenic	forms	of	isolated	dystonia	,	DYT	-	protein_homooligomerization	,	DYT	-	THAP1	,	DYT	-	GCH1	,	and	DYT	-	GNAL	.
s1145	This	mouse	model	might	mimic	and	explain	the	pathogenesis	of	hepatosteatosis	occurring	in	two	typical	disorders	of	adipose	tissue	dysfunction	,	obesity_and	lipodystrophy	,	particularly	in	lipodystrophic	patients	with	lipid_metabolic_process_mutation	.
s3422	In	sum	,	the	negative_regulation_of_cell	-	cell_adhesion_gene	is	epigenetically	silenced	or	downregulated	in	human	cancers	,	altering	the	balance	of	HGF	activation	/	inhibition	ratio	,	which	contributes	to	cancer	development	and	progression	.
s2200	USP18	was	also	significantly	enhanced	in	patients	with	human	epidermal	growth	factor	receptor	2-positive	breast	cancer	,	furthermore	,	Kaplan	-	Meier	curve	demonstrated	that	combining	USP18	and	regulation_of_apoptotic_process_expression	improved	prognostic	capability	in	breast	cancer	.	.
s430	Connectivity	mapping	identified	vinblastine	and	vincristine	as	agents	that	could	reverse	the	CD133/HOX	genes	/	cell	-	cell_junction_assembly	-	signature	,	and	we	confirmed	this	by	in	vitro	analysis	in	glioma_cell	lines	,	demonstrating	that	CD133	and	HOX	genes	were	co	-	expressed	and	could	be	downregulated	by	vincristine	.	.
s1329	She	manifested	macrocephaly	,	preaxial	polysyndactyly	,	psychomotor	developmental_delay	,	cerebral	cavernous	malformations	,	and	glucose	intolerance	due	to	a	6.2-Mb	deletion	of	7p14.1p12.3	which	included	GLI3	,	protein_phosphorylation	,	and	CCM2	.	.
s1837	This	review	discusses	recurrent	aberrations	in	NKTCL	detected	by	NGS	,	which	can	be	categorized	into	three	main	groups	,	specifically	,	tumor_suppressors	(	TP53	,	response_to_virus	,	and	MGA	)	,	the	JAK	/	STAT	cascade	,	and	epigenetic	modifiers	(	KMT2D	,	BCOR	,	ARID1A	,	and	EP300	)	.	.
s639	This	study	adds	knowledge	to	the	increasingly	growing	list	of	causative	and	candidate	genes	in	ID	and	epilepsy	,	and	highlights	positive_regulation_of_pathway	-	restricted_SMAD_protein_phosphorylation_as	a	new	gene	for	neurodevelopmental	disorders	.
s1808	Previously	,	we	demonstrated	that	a	unique	category	of	cancer_antigens	is	selectively	presented	by	tumor	cells	deficient	for	the	peptide	transporter	cytoskeletal_anchoring_at_plasma_membrane	,	enabling	a	specific	attack	of	such	tumors	without	causing	immunopathology	in	mouse	models	.	.
s433	Idiopathic	pulmonary	fibrosis	(	IPF	)	is	a	complex	,	heterogeneous_genetic	disorder	that	is	associated	with	rare	and	common	sequence	variants	in	many	genes	(	stimulatory_C	-	type_lectin_receptor_signaling_pathway	,	SFTPC	,	SFTPA2	,	RTEL1	,	TERT	,	and	hTR	)	,	11	novel	loci	,	and	multiple	emerging	epigenetic	and	transcriptional	profiles	.	.
s1346	CONCLUSIONS	ANXA11	plays	a	critical	role	in	regulating	GC	proliferation	,	migration	,	and	invasion	via	the	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	/	GSK-3b	pathway	,	and	can	potentially	be	used	as	a	prognostic	factor	and	therapeutic	target	for	gastric	cancer_patients	.
s922	Using	the	larval	startle	response	to	the	buzz	of	a	predator	(	wasp	)	,	we	examined	PPI	in	wild	-	type	flies	and	two	mutants	,	an	regulation_of_alternative_mRNA_splicing,_via_spliceosome_mutant	,	which	is	implicated	in	Fragile	X	syndrome	,	and	a	centaurin	gamma	1A	(	CenG1A	)	mutant	,	which	is	associated	with	GTPase	,	PH	,	ArfGAP	,	and	ANK	domains	and	implicated	in	autism	.	.
s3800	Here	,	we	show	in	colorectal	cancer_that	increased	expression	of	ZNF148	,	the	gene	coding	for	transcription	factor	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	correlated	with	reduced	patient	survival	.	.
s2947	We	hope	that	our	study	will	stimulate	further	studies	and	a	new	targeted	therapy	and	early	medical	intervention	for	regulation_of_cell_cycle	/	TAZ	could	be	a	useful	option	for	breast	cancer_cases	complicated	with	LKB1	deficiency	.
s3103	Mutations	of	the	five	genes	(	ARHGEF5	,	ANKRD20A2	,	ZNF595	,	ZNF812	,	vasculogenesis	)	may	be	potential	germline	mutations	of	lung	cancer	.	.
s252	tRNA_wobble_adenosine_to_inosine_editing	-	related	intellectual	disability	has	been	recently	described	in	24	individuals	from	eight	Saudi	families	who	had	cognitive	impairment	and	strabismus	.	.
s2157	RASSF7	was	significantly	up	-	regulated	in	HCC	tissues	and	cell	lines	,	and	correlated	with	post	-	translational_protein_modification	,	poor	tumor_histology	and	T	stage	.	.
s40	Furthermore	,	targeted	knockout	of	negative_regulation_of_phosphatase_activity_in	mice	results	in	retinal_degeneration_with	abnormal	ERG	response	.	.
s2325	A	prognostication	scoring	system	was	established	based	on	the	expression	levels	of	mismatch_repair-	,	CDK1-	,	and	CD151-related	genes	,	which	could	effectively	predict	the	overall	survival	in	a	TCGA	clear	cell	RCC	cohort	(	n	=	533	,	995.3	versus	2242.2	days	,	p	AAAA	0.0001	)	,	in	another	clear_cell_renal_cell_carcinoma_(ccRCC	)	cohort	E	-	GEOD-22541	(	n	=	44	,	390.0	versus	1889.2	days	,	p	=	0.0007	)	,	and	in	a	TCGA	papillary	RCC	(	pRCC	)	cohort	(	n	=	287	,	741.6	versus	1623.7	days	,	p	AAAA	0.0001	)	.	.
s3924	Variants	in	CPB1	,	CPA1	(	encoding	carboxypeptidase	B1	and	A1	)	,	and	cobalamin_metabolic_process_were	evaluated	in	a	second	set	of	cases	with	familial	pancreatic	cancer_and	controls	.	.
s2904	The	present	study	also	identified	in	tumor	and	potentially	malignant	lesions	common	alterations	of	chromosomal	regions	and	genes	,	including	FBXL5	,	UGT2B15	,	UGT2B28	,	KANSL1	,	GSTT1	and	peptidyl	-	tyrosine_dephosphorylation	,	being	some	of	these	typical	aberrations	described	in	oral	cancer_and	others	are	linked	to	chemoradioresistance	.	.
s2422	In	this	report	we	describe	a	female	child	with	global	developmental_delay	,	microcephaly	and	myoclonic	seizures	harbouring	a	5	Mb	deletion	in	14q12	locus	resulting	in	deletion	of	single	copy	of	brain	specific	genes	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	,	PRKD1	and	NOVA1	.	.
s945	Results	showed	that	sodium_ion_transport_was	upregulated	in	ovarian	cancer_compared	with	normal	ovarian	epithelial	tissues	.	.
s2023	Furthermore	,	we	demonstrated	that	silencing	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_in	pancreatic	cancer_cells	inhibited	aerobic	glycolysis	,	the	basis	for	providing	cancer	cells	with	building	blocks	for	macromolecule	synthesis	and	ATP	that	required	.	.
s887	16q24	deletion	involving	the	odontogenesis_of_dentin	-	containing_tooth_gene	,	ranging	from	137	kb	to	2	Mb	,	have	been	associated	with	a	microdeletion	syndrome	characterized	by	variable	cognitive_impairment	,	autism	spectrum	disorder	,	facial	dysmorphisms	with	dental	anomalies	,	brain	abnormalities	essentially	affecting	the	corpus	callosum	and	short	stature	.	.
s2170	Furthermore	,	in	utero	CRISPR	-	Cas9-mediated	genome	editing	of	regulation_of_translation_or	Tsc2	induced	the	development	of	spontaneous	behavioral	seizures	,	as	well	as	cytomegalic	neurons	and	cortical	dyslamination	.	.
s2911	Several	putative	genes	associated	with	hallmarks	of	malignancy	that	may	have	an	important	role	in	predicting	the	progression	of	leukoplakia	and	erythroleukoplakia	to	squamous_cell_carcinoma	,	namely	gains	in	BNIPL	,	response_to_cytokine	,	STAG2	,	CSPP1	and	ZNRF3	genes	were	also	identified	.
s3968	We	validated	ZBTB20	,	CELF2	,	PARD3	,	G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway_and	WAC	,	which	were	identified	by	our	screens	in	multiple	cancer_types	,	as	new	tumor	suppressor	genes	in	prostate	cancer	.	.
s1519	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	biological_process	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s1267	Insertion	of	a	single	-	chain	variable	-	fragment	antibody	(	scFv	)	to	signal_transduction_(human	epidermal	growth	factor	receptor	2	)	in	gD	,	gH	,	or	gB	gives	rise	to	herpes	simplex	viruses	(	HSVs	)	specifically	retargeted	to	HER2-positive	cancer_cells	,	hence	to	highly	specific	nonattenuated	oncolytic	agents	.	.
s3410	The	promoter	methylation	levels	of	phagocytosis,_engulfment_and	ELMO2	were	generally	low	,	whereas	ELMO3	methylation	levels	were	high	,	in	the	tumor_biopsies	.	.
s1515	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	lymphocyte_differentiation	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s3225	We	find	that	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_promotes	the	proliferation	of	breast	cancer_cells	by	increasing	the	activation	of	the	Akt	-	mTOR	signaling	,	and	Akt	inhibitor	Ipatasertib	or	MK-2206	represses	STX3	effects	on	the	growth	of	breast	cancer	cells	.	.
s2653	ETV1/4/5	factors	are	often	overexpressed	in	prostate	cancer_and	genome	-	wide	studies	in	a	prostate	cancer	cell	line	indicate	that	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_and	MED25	occupy	enhancers	that	are	enriched	for	ETS	-	binding	sequences	and	are	both	functionally	important	for	the	transcription	of	genes	regulated	by	these	enhancers	.	.
s88	Transcripts	of	camera	-	type_eye_development	,	a	gene	associated	with	angle	-	closure	glaucoma	,	posterior	microphthalmia_and	myopia	,	were	increased	in	Mfrprd6	eyes	by	17-fold	.	.
s2824	Among	these	biomarkers	,	the	optimal	cut	-	off	value	of	COL4A1	+	cell	-	matrix_adhesion_at	1.33	ng	/	mL	resulted	in	57.4	%	,	83.7	%	,	56.1	%	,	80.7	%	,	and	91.7	%	sensitivity	for	low	-	grade	tumors	,	high	-	grade	tumors	,	Ta	,	T1	,	and	muscle	invasive	disease	,	respectively	.	.
s3302	Here	we	report	three	individuals	with	biallelic	FANCM	truncating	mutations	who	developed	early	-	onset	cancer_and	toxicity	to	chemotherapy	but	did	not	present	congenital	malformations	or	any	hematological	phenotype	suggestive	of	FA.MethodsChromosomal	breakages	,	interstrand	crosslink	sensitivity	,	and	response_to_gamma_radiation_monoubiquitination	were	assessed	in	primary	fibroblasts	.	.
s1777	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	spermatogenesis	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s989	RT	-	PCR	analysis	showed	that	the	overall	transcriptional	activity	of	the	main	HS	biosynthesis	-	involved	genes	(	EXT1	,	EXT2	,	NDST1	,	NDST2	,	heparan_sulfate_proteoglycan_biosynthetic_process	,	HS2ST1	,	HS3ST1	,	HS3ST2	,	HS6ST1	,	HS6ST2	,	SULF1	,	SULF2	,	HPSE	)	was	decreased	by	1.5	-	2-fold	in	Grade	II	-	III	glioma	(	p	AAAA	0.01	)	and	by	3-fold	in	Grade	IV	glioma	(	glioblastoma	multiforme	,	GBM	)	(	p	AAAA	0.05	)	,	as	compared	with	the	para	-	tumourous	tissue	.	.
s3637	A	novel	mutation	of	an	essential	splice	site	in	the	C19orf70	gene	encoding	cristae_formation_induces	severe	mitochondrial	encephalopathy	,	hepatopathy	and	lactate	acidosis	consistent	with	psychomotor	retardation	.	.
s1514	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	positive_regulation_of_GTPase_activity	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s2683	Genes	harboring	the	most	significant	mutations	include	PCDH9	,	KLHL12	,	DCAF4L1	,	and	VHL	in	sporadic_HBs	,	and	ZNF814	,	DLG2	,	RIMS1	,	PNN	,	and	killing_of_cells_of_other_organism_in	familial	HBs	.	.
s439	In	the	past	5	years	,	we	have	found	that	,	1	)	genetic	risk	variants	play	major	and	similar	roles	in	the	development	of	both	familial	and	sporadic	fibrotic	idiopathic	interstitial	pneumonia	,	accounting	for	up	to	35	%	of	the	risk	of	idiopathic	interstitial	pneumonia	(	a	disease	that	was	previously	thought	to	be	idiopathic	)	,	2	)	a	promoter	variant	in	stimulatory_C	-	type_lectin_receptor_signaling_pathway_rs35705950	is	the	strongest	risk	factor	for	the	development	of	IIP	and	IPF	,	however	,	rs35705950	has	a	low	penetrance	,	and	3	)	IPF	is	a	complex	genetic	disease	with	11	independent	loci	contributing	to	the	development	of	this	disease	,	pronounced	changes	in	DNA	methylation	,	and	transcriptional	subtypes	.	.
s3080	Result	,	Three	mutant	genes	(	PTPN11	gene	in	chromosome	12	,	RIT1	gene	in	chromosome	1	and	activation_of_MAPKK_activity_gene	in	chromosome	3	)	in	five	cases	all	had	been	reported	to	be	related	to	hypertrophic	cardiomyopathy	.	.
s4070	Of	the	2	204	genes	that	were	mutated	,	APC	,	TTN	,	TP53	,	KRAS	,	protein_localization_to_M	-	band	,	SOX9	,	PCDH17	,	SIGLEC10	,	MYH6	,	and	BRD9	were	consistent	with	genes	being	an	early	driver	of	carcinogenesis	,	in	that	they	were	mutated	in	multiple	adenomas	and	multiple	carcinomas	.	.
s4077	Recently	,	a	new	type	of	limb	-	girdle_muscular_dystrophy_(LGMD	type	2Z	)	has	been	identified	due	to	a	missense	mutation	in	protein_O	-	linked_glycosylation_(protein	O	-	glucosyltransferase	-	Rumi	)	,	an	enzyme	capable	of	adding	glucose	to	a	distinct	serine	residue	of	epidermal	growth	factor	-	like	repeats	containing	a	C	-	X	-	S	-	X-(P	/	A)-C	consensus	sequence	such	as	Notch	receptors	.	.
s1116	We	expand	the	knowledge	about	protein_localization_to_plasma_membrane_deficiency	,	describing	a	patient	with	the	mild	phenotype	of	TTC7A	deficiency	but	presenting	overlapping	features	of	SD	/	THE	and	MIA	-	CID	,	intestinal	atresia	and	inflammatory	bowel	disease	evocative	of	MIA	-	CID	,	but	also	dental_abnormalities	,	huge	forehead	,	liver	abnormalities	,	autoimmune	thyroiditis	and	hypogammaglobulinemia	,	evocative	of	SD	/	THE	.
s3028	The	activation_of_innate_immune_response_gene	is	mutated	in	a	form	of	distal_myopathy	and	amyotrophic	lateral	sclerosis	(	ALS	)	.	.
s2614	To	elucidate	the	possible	functions	of	EVs	in	protein_phosphorylation	-	mutant	melanoma	,	we	determined	the	RNA	content	of	the	EVs	,	including	apoptotic	bodies	,	microvesicles	,	and	exosomes	,	released	from	such	cancer_cells	after	vemurafenib	treatment	.	.
s3185	In	previous	reports	,	a	total	of	6	cases	have	been	performed	esophagectomy	for	esophageal	cancer_with	protein_methylation_in	Japan	.	.
s3158	Defects	of	CIB2	,	calcium-	and	integrin	-	binding	protein	2	,	have	been	reported	to	cause	isolated	deafness	,	DFNB48	and	Usher	syndrome	cardiac_muscle_tissue_development	-	IJ	,	characterized	by	congenital	profound	deafness	,	balance	defects	and	blindness	.	.
s1204	In	particular	,	MYH9	mutations	result	in	congenital	macrothrombocytopenia	and	predispose	to	kidney	failure	,	hearing	loss	,	and	cataracts	,	MPL	and	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_mutations	cause	congenital	thrombocytopenia	evolving	into	bone	marrow	failure	,	whereas	thrombocytopenias	caused	by	RUNX1	,	ANKRD26	,	and	ETV6	mutations	are	characterized	by	predisposition	to	hematological	malignancies	.	.
s1171	The	G	-	protein	beta	subunit	3	(	cell_volume_homeostasis	)	gene	has	been	implicated	in	obesity_risk	,	however	,	the	molecular	mechanism	of	GNB3-related	disease	is	unknown	.	.
s817	In	childhood	tumors	,	including	retinoblastoma	,	osteosarcoma	,	and	neuroblastoma	,	the	RB	-	regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_pathway	is	inactivated	,	as	a	rule	.	.
s1090	protein_ubiquitination_is	also	amplified	in	metastatic	cancers	and	its	depletion	in	a	NSG	mouse	xenograft	model	inhibits	tumor_growth	and	metastasis	.	.
s580	The	results	indicated	that	compared	with	the	adjacent	non	-	tumor	tissues	and	a	normal	gastric	epithelial	cell	line	,	gastric	cancer_tissues	and	cell	lines	exhibited	significantly	higher	expression	of	proteasomal_protein_catabolic_process	.	.
s1582	The	main	clinical	feature	was	similar	to	Lichtenstein	-	Knorr	syndrome	but	deafness_may	not	be	an	essential	phenotypic	feature	of	cellular_sodium_ion_homeostasis_mutation	.	.
s618	We	report	a	new	(	fifth	)	patient	with	the	cblJ	disorder	who	presented	at	7	days	of	age	with	poor	feeding	,	hypotonia	,	methylmalonic_aciduria	,	and	elevated	plasma	homocysteine	and	harbored	the	mutations	c.1667_1668delAG	[	p	.	Glu556Glyfs	27	]	and	c.1295GAAAAA	[	p	.	Arg432Gln	]	in	the	cobalamin_metabolic_process_gene	.	.
s3575	Results	,	The	relative	expression	levels	of	HOXA11-positive_regulation_of_T_cell_mediated_cytotoxicity_in	tumor_tissue	and	paired	adjacent	tissue	were	0.832	+	0.387	and	2.486	+	1.087	,	respectively	,	with	significant	difference	(	PAAAA0.001	)	.	.
s2221	The	mammalian	target	of	rapamycin	(	regulation_of_cell_growth	)	pathway	is	overactivated	in	thyroid	cancer_(TC	)	.	.
s2912	Several	putative	genes	associated	with	hallmarks	of	malignancy	that	may	have	an	important	role	in	predicting	the	progression	of	leukoplakia	and	erythroleukoplakia	to	squamous_cell_carcinoma	,	namely	gains	in	BNIPL	,	MCL1	,	sister_chromatid_cohesion	,	CSPP1	and	ZNRF3	genes	were	also	identified	.
s1262	The	effect	of	autophagy_on	exosome	production	promotes	the	migration	and	in	vivo	metastasis	of	orthotopic	breast	cancer_cells	.	.
s3374	Our	patient	had	all	the	major	characteristic	features	consistent	with	Ellis	-	glycoprotein_biosynthetic_process_Creveld	syndrome	including	post	-	axial	polydactyly	,	teeth	and	nail	abnormalities	,	congenital_heart_defect_and	skeletal	dysplasia	.	.
s802	PTEN	,	KRAS	and	phosphatidylinositol_3-kinase_signaling_were	the	most	frequently	mutated	canonical	cancer	-	related	genes	.	.
s2469	Permanent	visual_impairment_(bilateral	best	-	corrected	visual	acuity	AAAA	0.3	)	was	found	in	7	patients	,	including	patients	with	a	mutation	in	activation_of_MAPKK_activity	,	SHOC2	,	and	KRAS	.	.
s3503	Here	,	we	identify	tumor	-	associated	calcium	signal	transducer	2	(	negative_regulation_of_epithelial_cell_migration	)	,	one	of	the	most	downregulated	genes	in	primary	HCC	tissue	,	as	a	host	factor	that	interacts	with	CLDN1	and	OCLN	and	regulates	their	cellular	localization	.	.
s2579	negative_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_was	decreased	in	more	aggressive	subtypes	,	large	cell	carcinoma_and	adenocarcinoma	-	squamous	cell	carcinoma	.	.
s1583	Taken	together	,	we	firstly	revealed	that	quercetin	suppressed	the	progression	of	breast	cancer_by	inhibiting	cell	mobility	and	glycolysis	through	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	-	mTOR	pathway	mediated	autophagy	induction	and	may	provide	a	potential	therapeutic	target	for	breast	cancer	treatment	.
s1755	This	pathway	is	required	to	maintain	levels	of	GPL	,	especially	phosphatidylethanolamine	(	PE	)	,	as	shown	by	stable	shRNA	-	mediated	silencing	of	pyruvate_metabolic_process	-	M	in	H23	lung	cancer_cells	.	.
s2441	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II/4/5	factors	are	often	overexpressed	in	prostate	cancer_and	genome	-	wide	studies	in	a	prostate	cancer	cell	line	indicate	that	ETV4	and	MED25	occupy	enhancers	that	are	enriched	for	ETS	-	binding	sequences	and	are	both	functionally	important	for	the	transcription	of	genes	regulated	by	these	enhancers	.	.
s161	Furthermore	,	parallel	immunohistochemical	analysis	of	three	PP2A	inhibitors	demonstrated	that	two	PP2A	inhibitors	,	CIP2A	and	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	,	are	highly	expressed	in	both	dysplastic	and	adenocarcinomatous	tumors	of	the	Smgb	-	Tag	mice	.	.
s3922	Variants	in	proteolysis	,	CPA1	(	encoding	carboxypeptidase	B1	and	A1	)	,	and	CTRC	were	evaluated	in	a	second	set	of	cases	with	familial	pancreatic	cancer_and	controls	.	.
s1366	Ellis	-	glycoprotein_biosynthetic_process_Creveld	syndrome	is	an	autosomal_recessive_skeletal	dysplasia	primarily	characterized	by	the	features	such	as	disproportionate	dwarfism	,	short	ribs	,	short	limbs	,	dysplastic	nails	,	cardiovascular	malformations	,	post	-	axial	polydactyly	(	PAP	)	(	bilateral	)	of	hands	and	feet	.	.
s952	In	proximal_renal	tubules	,	regulation_of_phosphate_transport_suppresses	the	membrane	expression	of	the	sodium	-	phosphate	cotransporters	Npt2a	and	Npt2c	which	mediate	urinary	reabsorption	of	filtered	phosphate	.	.
s2501	CHD	proteins	play	an	important	role	in	neurodevelopment	,	as	pathogenic	variants	in	CHD1	,	CHD2	,	CHD4	,	CHD7	and	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_have	been	associated	with	a	range	of	neurological	phenotypes	,	including	autism	spectrum	disorder	(	ASD	)	,	intellectual_disability_(ID	)	and	epilepsy	.	.
s1064	In	four	of	them	otosclerosis	was	said	to	be	present	,	one	patient	had	hearing_loss_due	to	severe	stapes	fixation	at	the	age	of	6	years	,	providing	evidence	that	hearing	loss	in	the	positive_regulation_of_pathway	-	restricted_SMAD_protein_phosphorylation	-	related	multiple	synostoses	syndrome	can	be	present	in	childhood	.	.

s3892	Importantly	,	we	found	that	the	antitumor_effects	of	cell_cycle_arrest_on	the	resistant	cells	were	associated	with	the	downregulation	of	Notch	signaling	.	.
s1823	Unlike	patients	with	ECTD-9	,	anatomical_structure_morphogenesis	-	mutated	mice	and	pigs	do	not	faithfully	recapitulate	the	phenotype	of	hypotrichosis	,	so	there	is	a	limited	understanding	of	the	molecular	mechanism	of	Hoxc13-mediated	hypotrichosis	in	animal	models	and	clinically	.	.
s1418	Taken	together	,	these	findings	offer	additional	insight	into	the	early	transcriptional	changes	caused	by	negative_regulation_of_intracellular_transport_and	Cryab	mutations	associated	with	autosomal	dominant	human	cataracts	,	and	indicate	that	the	transcript	levels	of	certain	genes	are	affected	by	the	expression	of	mutant	a	-	crystallin	in	vivo	.
s718	Therefore	,	this	study	demonstrated	that	there	exists	an	protein_K27-linked_ubiquitination	/	ERa	/	Bcl	-	xL	axle	in	breast	cancer_which	promotes	cancer	cell	proliferation	and	survival	.	.
s4061	Genes	harboring	the	most	significant	mutations	include	PCDH9	,	KLHL12	,	DCAF4L1	,	and	VHL	in	sporadic_HBs	,	and	ZNF814	,	DLG2	,	RIMS1	,	cell_adhesion	,	and	MUC7	in	familial	HBs	.	.
s1032	The	increased	regulation_of_modification_of_postsynaptic_actin_cytoskeleton	-	GTP	results	from	AKT	phosphorylating	three	serines	(	S298	,	S329	,	and	S567	)	in	the	DLC1	tumor_suppressor	,	a	Rho	GTPase	-	activating	protein	(	RhoGAP	)	associated	with	focal	adhesions	.	.
s1164	Methods	,	Ten	potentially	functional	single	nucleotide	polymorphisms	(	SNPs	)	in	seven	prostate	CSC	marker	genes	,	TACSTD2	,	PROM1	,	substrate	-	dependent_cell_migration	,	POU5F1	,	EZH2	,	PSCA	,	and	CD44	,	were	selected	for	analysis	of	their	association	with	disease	recurrence	by	Kaplan	-	Meier	analysis	and	Cox	regression	in	a	cohort	of	320	patients	with	localized	prostate	cancer_receiving	radical	prostatectomy	.	.
s2649	Purposeregulation_of_synaptic_vesicle_exocytosis_deficiency	causes	neonatal	hypotonia	,	ptosis	,	neonatal	feeding_difficulties	,	childhood	obesity	,	xerostomia	,	and	growth	hormone	deficiency	.	.
s759	This	study	showed	that	AMP_biosynthetic_process_myopathy_was	not	rare	among	distal	myopathy	patients	of	Korean	origin	,	and	expanded	the	clinical	and	genetic	spectrum	.	.
s2551	Expectedly	,	the	analysis	of	the	DEGs	common	to	all	three	alterations	highlighted	a	group	of	BioFunctions	that	included	Cell	Proliferation	of	tumor_cell	lines	(	14	DEGs	)	,	Invasion	of	cells	(	10	DEGs	)	and	Migration	of	tumour	cell	lines	(	10	DEGs	)	,	with	a	common	core	of	5	genes	(	ATF3	,	CDKN1A	,	GDF15	,	HBEGF	and	LCN2	)	that	likely	represent	downstream	effectors	of	the	pro	-	oncogenic	activities	of	PI3K	/	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_signalling	.	.
s3176	Thus	,	our	data	indicate	that	in	pancreatic	cancer_cells	,	the	expression	of	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_may	be	controlled	by	a	pathway	mediated	by	SMAD4	.	.
s3207	An	inverse	correlation	between	the	expression	levels	of	human	Nanos1	and	Nanos3	and	E	-	integrin	-	mediated_signaling_pathway_was	observed	in	several	cancer_cell	lines	.	.
s3686	Pathogenic	variants	in	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_were	recently	described	in	three	back	-	to	-	back	publications	in	association	with	a	novel	neurodevelopmental	disorder	characterized	by	intellectual_disability	,	speech	delay	,	ataxia	,	and	facial	dysmorphisms	.	.
s2535	Smith	-	Magenis	syndrome	(	SMS	)	,	a	neurodevelopmental	disorder	characterized	by	dysmorphic	features	,	intellectual	disability	(	ID	)	,	and	sleep_disturbances	,	results	from	a	17p11.2	microdeletion	or	a	mutation	in	the	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_gene	.	.
s1415	Neonatal	-	onset	multiple	acyl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	deficiency	(	fatty_acid_beta	-	oxidation_using_acyl	-	CoA_dehydrogenase_type	I	)	is	an	autosomal_recessive_disorder	of	the	electron	transfer	flavoprotein	function	characterized	by	a	severe	clinical	and	biochemical	phenotype	,	including	congenital	abnormalities	with	unresponsiveness	to	riboflavin	treatment	as	distinguishing	features	.	.
s2352	Specifically	,	Nrf2	plays	an	indispensable	role	in	NSCLC	cell	sensitivity	to	platinum	-	based	treatments	and	we	found	that	combination	of	cellular_iron_ion_homeostasis-673451	and	cisplatin	produced	a	synergistic	anticancer_effect	and	substantial	ROS	production	in	vitro	.	.
s4013	negative_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_was	decreased	in	more	aggressive	subtypes	,	large	cell	carcinoma	and	adenocarcinoma	-	squamous_cell_carcinoma	.	.
s1569	Molecular	genetic	studies	of	PCR	and	direct	sequencing	showed	negative_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_mutations	in	4	of	7	(	4/7	)	cases	,	4	of	the	four	mutation	-	carrying	cases	showed	diffuse	b	-	catenin	nuclear	and	cytoplasm	immunoreactivity	and	diffuse	cyclin	D1	nuclear	immunoreactivity	in	the	tumor_cells	.	.
s3659	Western	blot	analysis	,	real	-	time	PCR	,	MTT	assay	and	flow	cytometric	analysis	were	performed	and	the	results	demonstrated	that	compared	with	the	gastric	cancer_SGC-7901	cells	,	the	expression	of	cerebral_cortex_development	,	NF	-	kB	p65	,	NF	-	kB	p	-	p65	and	mesenchymal	marker	vimentin	were	significantly	increased	in	gastric	cancer	multidrug	-	resistant	SGC-7901/CDDP	cells	,	and	the	epithelial	cell	marker	ZO-1	was	significantly	decreased	.	.
s1238	We	investigated	the	association	between	five	ubiquitin	-	dependent_protein_catabolic_process_gene	polymorphisms	and	Wilms	_	tumor_susceptibility	in	a	Chinese	population	consisting	of	145	patients	and	531	controls	.	.
s3623	Ablation	of	SRC-3	or	fructose_2,6-bisphosphate_metabolic_process_suppresses	breast	tumour_growth	in	mice	and	prevents	metastasis	to	the	lung	from	an	orthotopic	setting	,	as	does	Ser857Ala	-	mutant	SRC-3	.	.
s159	Our	genome	-	wide	study	showed	that	apoptotic_process_involved_in_morphogenesis	,	a	PP2A	subunit	encoding	tumor_suppressor	gene	,	is	underexpressed	in	submandibular	gland	tumors	of	Smgb	-	Tag	mice	.	.
s1962	It	was	our	aim	to	investigate	behavioral	and	obesity_effects	evoked	by	treatment	with	probiotics	via	neuroinflammatory	factors	and	namely	IL-1b	,	negative_regulation_of_NF	-	kappaB_transcription_factor_activity	,	Caspase-1	and	NF	-	kB	levels	in	the	Syrian	golden	hamster	.	.
s2714	mitochondrial_transport_encodes	for	a	ubiquitous	heme	exporter	,	whose	recessive	mutations	cause	posterior	column	ataxia_with	retinitis	pigmentosa	(	PCARP	)	.	.
s1416	To	investigate	the	mechanism	by	which	the	a	-	crystallin	mutations	negative_regulation_of_intracellular_transport	-	R49C	and	Cryab	-	R120	G	lead	to	cataract_formation	,	we	determined	whether	these	mutations	cause	an	altered	expression	of	specific	transcripts	in	the	lens	at	an	early	postnatal	age	by	RNA	-	seq	analysis	.	.
s1507	A	replicative	analysis	of	associations	of	15	SNPs	located	in	the	regions	of	11	genes	(	TCF4	,	VRK2	,	NOTCH4	,	ZNF804A	,	AGBL1	,	RELN	,	ZFP64P1	,	KCNB2	,	CSMD1	,	proteolysis_involved_in_cellular_protein_catabolic_process	,	NRIP1	)	and	three	intergenic	regions	(	SLCO6A1/LINCOO491	,	LOC105376248/LOC105376249	,	SPA17/NRGN	)	with	schizophrenia_was	conducted	in	the	Russian	population	of	the	Siberian	region	.	.
s458	We	demonstrated	that	regulation_of_synaptic_transmission,_glycinergic-5,2	was	remarkably	downregulated	in	131I	-	resistant	thyroid	cancer_cell	lines	and	131I	-	insensitive	patients	and	was	positively	correlated	with	Poly	(	ADP	-	ribose	)	polymerase	1	(	PARP-1	)	expression	and	its	activation	.	.
s3648	Nevertheless	,	it	is	still	ambiguous	whether	cerebral_cortex_development_is	involved	in	the	chemoresistance	of	gastric	cancer	.	.
s3093	In	summary	,	our	results	reveal	that	rare	loss	-	of	-	function	variants	in	signal_transduction_increase	the	risk	for	a	varying	combination	of	epilepsy	,	intellectual	disability	/	developmental_delay_and	dysmorphic	features	,	presenting	in	some	pedigrees	with	an	X	-	linked	inheritance	pattern	.
s1294	In	a	clinical	sense	,	recognizing	those	smoothened_signaling_pathway_genes	and	associated	phenotypes	may	improve	our	diagnostic	capabilities	by	enabling	us	to	prioritize	the	screening	of	particular	gene(s	)	such	as	synkinesia	(	ANOS1	)	,	dental_agenesis_(FGF8/FGFR1	)	and	hearing	loss	(	CHD7	)	.	.
s2926	Notably	,	genetic	deletion	or	pharmacological	inhibition	of	mitotic_chromosome_movement_towards_spindle_pole_significantly	decreases	tumor_growth	.	.
s3788	Oral	and	pharyngeal	cancers	combined	were	associated	with	loci	at	6p21.32	(	rs3828805	,	HLA	-	DQB1	)	,	10q26.13	(	rs201982221	,	phosphate	-	containing_compound_metabolic_process	)	and	11p15.4	(	rs1453414	,	OR52N2-TRIM5	)	.	.
s2223	We	previously	demonstrated	that	phospho	-	mTOR	expression	is	associated	with	tumor_aggressiveness	,	therapy	resistance	,	and	lower	mRNA	expression	of	iodide_transport_in	papillary	thyroid	carcinoma	(	PTC	)	,	while	phospho	-	S6	(	mTORC1	effector	)	expression	was	associated	with	less	aggressive	clinicopathological	features	.	.
s842	As	expected	,	we	found	that	phosphorylation_mutant	cancer_cells	require	PIK3CA	but	also	require	the	expression	of	the	TCA	cycle	enzyme	2-oxoglutarate	dehydrogenase	(	OGDH	)	.	.
s1811	In	wild	type	(	WT	)	mice	,	we	found	that	ginsenoside	Rg3	treatment	significantly	mitigated	pathological	damages	and	reduced	myeloperoxidase	(	MPO	)	activity	as	well	as	the	production	of	pro	-	inflammatory	cytokines	tumor_necrosis	factor	-	a	(	TNF	-	a	)	,	interleukin-1b	(	IL-1b	)	and	interleukin-6	(	IL-6	)	,	furthermore	,	the	production	of	anti	-	inflammatory	mediators	interleukin-10	(	IL-10	)	and	transforming	growth	factor	-	b	(	TGF	-	b	)	,	polarization	of	M2	macrophages	and	expression	levels	of	the	phosphorylation	of	phosphatidylinositol	3-hydroxy	kinase	(	PI3	K	)	,	protein	kinase	B	(	PKB	,	also	known	as	AKT	)	,	mammalian	target	of	rapamycin	(	regulation_of_cell_growth	)	and	Mer	receptor	tyrosine	kinase	(	MerTK	)	were	promoted	.	.
s1638	Inhibition	of	p53-negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_complex	has	been	emerging	as	a	strategy	for	antitumoral	drug	development	considering	the	pro	-	apoptotic	role	of	functional	p53	in	tumor	cells	.	.
s1394	Taken	together	,	the	results	indicate	that	increase	of	HS	content	and	up	-	regulation	of	receptor	-	mediated_endocytosis	/	HSPG2	expression	in	glioblastoma	tissues	contribute	to	tumour_development	through	the	transformation	of	brain	extracellular	matrix	into	tumour	microenvironment	,	and	represent	negative	prognostic	factors	for	glioblastoma	progression	.
s2196	In	addition	,	the	results	indicated	that	USP18	may	promote	the	epidermal	growth	factor	(	angiogenesis)-mediated	EGF	receptor	(	EGFR)/AKT	/	S	-	phase	kinase	-	associated	protein	2	(	Skp2	)	pathway	by	upregulating	EGFR	and	Skp2	in	a	AKT	/	forkhead	box	O3-dependent	manner	in	breast	cancer	.	.
s1278	Our	previous	work	showed	that	loss	of	transcription,_DNA	-	templated_enhances	proliferation	and	migration	of	renal	cancer_cells	.	.
s2060	Among	all	lung_adenocarcinomas	,	the	most	prevalent	subset	develops	via	tumorigenesis	and	progression	from	atypical	adenomatous	hyperplasia	(	AAH	)	to	adenocarcinoma	in	situ	(	AIS	)	,	to	minimally	invasive	adenocarcinoma	(	cell_proliferation	)	,	to	overt	invasive	adenocarcinoma	with	a	lepidic	pattern	.	.
s2383	Seventy	resected	tumours	were	dissociated	into	single	cells	and	stained	with	antibodies	to	hyaluronan_catabolic_process_as	well	as	CD45	and	CD31	(	together	referred	as	Lineage	/	Lin	)	.	.
s222	Another	polymorphism	,	rs12970291	near	gene	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	was	associated	with	both	CRC	and	EC	(	OR	=	1.26	,	P	=	4.82	x	10(-8	)	)	,	with	the	alleles	showing	opposite	effects	on	the	risks	of	the	two	cancers	.
s1165	Methods	,	Ten	potentially	functional	single	nucleotide	polymorphisms	(	SNPs	)	in	seven	prostate	CSC	marker	genes	,	TACSTD2	,	PROM1	,	ITGA2	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	EZH2	,	PSCA	,	and	CD44	,	were	selected	for	analysis	of	their	association	with	disease	recurrence	by	Kaplan	-	Meier	analysis	and	Cox	regression	in	a	cohort	of	320	patients	with	localized	prostate	cancer_receiving	radical	prostatectomy	.	.
s960	Renal	agenesis	and	hypodysplasia	(	ammonium_transmembrane_transport	)	are	major	causes	of	pediatric	chronic	kidney	disease	and	are	highly	genetically	heterogeneous	.	.
s2882	Biallelic	biological_process_mutations	were	described	in	children	with	hyperphenylalaninemia	,	neurodevelopmental	delay	,	and	dystonia	.	.
s920	The	HECT	-	type	ubiquitin	ligase	HECT	,	UBA	and	WWE	Domain	Containing	1	,	(	protein_polyubiquitination	)	regulates	key	cancer	-	related	pathways	,	including	the	Myc	oncogene	.	.
s255	The	human	Shwachman	-	Diamond	syndrome	(	SDS	)	is	an	autosomal_recessive_disease	caused	by	mutations	in	a	highly	conserved	ribosome	assembly	factor	mitotic_spindle_organization	.	.
s3101	Mutations	of	the	five	genes	(	ARHGEF5	,	biological_process	,	ZNF595	,	ZNF812	,	MYO18B	)	may	be	potential	germline	mutations	of	lung	cancer	.	.
s83	In	Mfrprd6	eyes	,	a	significant	1.5-	to	2.0-fold	decrease	was	observed	among	transcripts	of	genes	linked	to	retinal_degeneration	,	including	those	involved	in	visual	cycle	(	Rpe65	,	Lrat	,	Rgr	)	,	phototransduction	(	Pde6a	,	receptor_guanylyl_cyclase_signaling_pathway	,	Rgs9	)	,	and	photoreceptor	disc	morphogenesis	(	Rrelationip1	and	Fscn2	)	.	.
s1852	This	bioinformatics	analysis	demonstrated	that	stage	-	related	prognostic	DEGs	,	such	as	COL3A1	,	COL1A1	,	COL1A2	,	KRAS	,	and	positive_regulation_of_endothelial_cell_proliferation_might	play	an	unfavorable	role	in	the	development	as	well	as	metastasis	of	ovarian	cancer	.	.
s3365	In	summary	,	these	data	suggested	an	important	role	of	BKCa	in	proliferation	and	migration	of	endometrial	cancer_establishment_of_mitotic_spindle_orientation-1-B	cells	.	.
s649	IL17RD	expression	was	increased	in	ulcerative	colitis	cancers	,	and	protein_polyubiquitination-193a-3p	treatment	decreased	growth	and	EGFR	signaling	of	HCT116	cells	in	xenografts	expressing	both	IL17RD	with	WT	3	UTR	compared	with	cells	expressing	IL17RD	with	mutant	3	UTR.Conclusions	,	miR-193a-3p	is	downregulated	in	ulcerative	colitis	neoplasia	,	and	its	loss	promotes	carcinogenesis	through	upregulation	of	IL17RD	.	.
s3558	Eight	of	the	genes	,	cellular_response_to_DNA_damage_stimulus	,	TP53	,	ATM	,	CSMD3	,	LRP1B	,	RYR2	,	BIRC6	,	and	MUC17	,	contained	mutations	in	AAAA20	%	of	the	carcinomas	.	.
s2546	A	single	family	with	an	autosomal_recessive_form	of	OFCS	and	a	homozygous	missense	mutation	in	skeletal_system_development_gene	has	been	described	.	.
s521	To	date	variants	in	four	genes	GLI3	,	limb_morphogenesis	,	MIPOL1	and	PITX1	have	been	implicated	in	developing	non	-	syndromic	form	of	polydactyly	.	.
s2769	Addition	of	exogenous	SLURP1	(	6XHis	-	tagged	,	E.	coli	expressed	and	partially	purified	using	Ni	-	ion	columns	)	significantly	suppressed	the	tumor_necrosis	factor	-	a	(	protein_import_into_nucleus,_translocation	-	a)-stimulated	human	umbilical	cord	vascular	endothelial	cell	(	HUVEC	)	tube	formation	.	.
s1662	To	the	best	of	our	knowledge	,	this	is	the	first	documented	case	of	synchronous	colon	and	prostate	cancers	,	with	isolated	mismatch_repair_loss	present	in	the	colon	cancer	while	intact	DNA	mismatch	repair	(	MMR	)	protein	expressions	present	in	the	prostate	cancer	,	in	the	English	literature	.	.
s496	While	polyglutamine	ataxias	,	linked	to	CAG	repeat	expansions	in	genes	such	as	ATXN1	,	negative_regulation_of_receptor_internalization	,	ATXN3	,	ATXN7	,	CACNA1A	and	TBP	,	have	been	extensively	characterized	in	large	cohorts	,	there	is	a	need	for	comprehensive	assessment	of	frequency	and	phenotype	of	more	_	conventional	_	ataxias	.	.
s2455	Conclusions	,	Genetic	polymorphisms	of	mismatch_repair_rs175057	and	MSH2	rs13019654	loci	can	predict	the	nCRT	response	,	while	MLH3	rs175057	as	well	as	MSH2	rs3771273	,	rs10188090	and	rs10191478	may	predict	prognosis	in	patients	with	locally	advanced	rectal	cancer_who	received	preoperative	chemoradiotherapy	.	.
s3285	Furthermore	,	these	in	vitro	findings	were	validated	in	vivo	and	the	ERK1/2	and	PI3k	/	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_signaling	pathways	were	involved	in	PSMB8-triggered	migration	and	proliferation	of	glioma_cells	.	.
s1172	cell_volume_homeostasis_duplication	is	responsible	for	a	syndromic	form	of	childhood	obesity	,	and	an	activating	DNA	sequence	variant	(	C825	T	)	in	GNB3	is	also	associated	with	obesity	.	.
s1375	The	contiguous	deletion	of	Wnt_signaling_pathway_and	its	neighbouring	genes	,	MAOA	/	B	and	EFHC2	,	reportedly	leads	to	syndromic	clinical	features	such	as	microcephaly	,	intellectual	disability	,	and	epilepsy	.	.
s863	Metabolic	cutis	laxa	results	from	Menkes	syndrome	,	caused	by	a	defect	in	the	ATPase	copper	transporting	alpha	(	ATP7A	)	gene	,	congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	due	to	mutations	in	subunit	7	of	the	component	of	oligomeric	Golgi	(	protein_glycosylation)-congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	(	CDG	)	complex	,	combined	disorder	of	N-	and	O	-	linked	glycosylation	,	due	to	mutations	in	ATPase	H+	transporting	V0	subunit	a2	(	ATP6VOA2	)	gene	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	reductase	1	deficiency	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	synthase	deficiency	,	macrocephaly	,	alopecia	,	cutis	laxa	,	and	scoliosis_(MACS	)	syndrome	,	due	to	Ras	and	Rab	interactor	2	(	RIN2	)	mutations	,	transaldolase	deficiency	caused	by	mutations	in	the	transaldolase	1	(	TALDO1	)	gene	,	Gerodermia	osteodysplastica	due	to	mutations	in	the	golgin	,	RAB6-interacting	(	GORAB	or	SCYL1BP1	)	gene	,	and	mitogen	-	activated	pathway	(	MAP	)	kinase	defects	,	caused	by	mutations	in	several	genes	[	protein	tyrosine	phosphatase	,	non	-	receptor	-	type	11	(	PTPN11	)	,	RAF	,	NF	,	HRas	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	HRAS	)	,	B	-	Raf	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	BRAF	)	,	MEK1/2	,	KRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	KRAS	)	,	SOS	Ras	/	Rho	guanine	nucleotide	exchange	factor	2	(	SOS2	)	,	leucine	rich	repeat	scaffold	protein	(	SHOC2	)	,	NRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	NRAS	)	,	and	Raf-1	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	RAF1	)	]	,	which	regulate	the	Ras	-	MAPK	cascade	.	.
s304	Although	there	are	nearly	100	different	causative	genes	identified	for	nonsyndromic	hearing_loss_(NSHL	)	,	Sanger	sequencing	-	based	DNA	diagnostics	usually	only	analyses	three	,	namely	,	gap_junction_assembly	,	SLC26A4	,	and	OTOF	.	.
s1070	Finally	,	through	a	xenograft	nude	mice	model	,	we	demonstrated	that	biological_process_is	pivotal	for	EGFR	mutated	lung	cancer_cell	growth	in	vivo	.	.
s3957	In	severe	bilateral	cases	(	anophthalmia	or	severe	microphthalmia	)	the	genetic	cause	is	now	identifiable	in	approximately	80	percent	of	cases	,	with	de	novo	heterozygous	loss	-	of	-	function	mutations	in	osteoblast_differentiation_or	OTX2	being	the	most	common	.	.
s2962	High	protein_monoubiquitination_expression	was	correlated	with	higher	pathological	grade	,	advanced	TNM	stage	,	tumor_vascular	invasion	,	and	poor	overall	and	disease	-	free	survivals	in	two	independent	cohorts	containing	827	patients	with	HCC	.	.
s2297	Mutations	in	ACVRL1	,	transmembrane_receptor_protein_serine	/	threonine_kinase_signaling_pathway	,	or	ENG	are	associated	with	hereditary	hemorrhagic	telangiectasia	and	pulmonary_arterial_hypertension_in	humans	[	1	,	2	]	.	.
s3690	Pseudophakic	proteolysiss	were	more	likely	to	have	a	history	of	diabetic	retinopathy	,	epiretinal_membrane	,	and	eyes	were	not	treated	with	topical	NSAID.This	study	showed	a	wide	clinical	spectrum	of	CMLs	.	.
s1552	Finally	,	proteolysis_expression	correlated	with	poor	survival	in	many	cancers	.	.
s2823	Among	these	biomarkers	,	the	optimal	cut	-	off	value	of	branching_involved_in_blood_vessel_morphogenesis_+	COL13A1	at	1.33	ng	/	mL	resulted	in	57.4	%	,	83.7	%	,	56.1	%	,	80.7	%	,	and	91.7	%	sensitivity	for	low	-	grade	tumors	,	high	-	grade	tumors	,	Ta	,	T1	,	and	muscle	invasive	disease	,	respectively	.	.
s882	The	PHKG2	and	RNF40	genes	are	either	overlapping	or	close	to	the	sequences	of	SCAR	marker	BC13	-	4	,	while	SCAR	marker	apoptotic_nuclear_changes-1	is	in	the	intron	and	overlap	the	DPEP1	gene	,	suggesting	that	alterations	in	the	expression	of	these	genes	could	contribute	to	cancer_progression	.	.
s2073	Mutations	in	negative_regulation_of_keratinocyte_proliferation_cause	a	wide	spectrum	of	phenotypes	in	humans	ranging	from	mild	X	-	linked	intellectual_disability_to	a	severe	microcephaly	(	MC	)	and	pontocerebellar	hypoplasia	syndrome	.	.
s2087	proteolysis_is	a	serine	protease	suggested	to	play	a	role	in	the	pathogenesis	of	various	diseases	,	including	age	-	related	macular_degeneration_and	osteoarthritis	,	by	modulating	extracellular	matrix	or	cell	surface	proteins	.	.
s3971	Based	on	these	findings	,	we	infer	that	high	sodium_ion_transport_expression	is	an	independent	predictor	for	poor	OS	in	grade	3/4	serous	ovarian	cancer	.	.
s3092	In	summary	,	our	results	reveal	that	rare	loss	-	of	-	function	variants	in	signal_transduction_increase	the	risk	for	a	varying	combination	of	epilepsy	,	intellectual_disability	/	developmental	delay	and	dysmorphic	features	,	presenting	in	some	pedigrees	with	an	X	-	linked	inheritance	pattern	.
s1123	The	older	brother	presented	with	progressive	gait	difficulties	,	hypotonia	,	intermittent	dystonia	,	polycythemia	,	and	characteristic	T_cell_costimulation	-	hyperintense	lesions	on	MRI	brain	.	.
s3421	In	sum	,	the	SPINT2	gene	is	epigenetically	silenced	or	downregulated	in	human	cancers	,	altering	the	balance	of	neutrophil_apoptotic_process_activation	/	inhibition	ratio	,	which	contributes	to	cancer	development	and	progression	.
s2950	Loss	-	of	-	function	mutations	in	protein_dephosphorylation_cause	the	severe	congenital	myopathy	called	myotubular	myopathy	(	or	X	-	linked	centronuclear	myopathy	)	while	mutations	in	the	MTM1-related	protein	MTMR2	cause	a	recessive	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	peripheral	neuropathy	.	.
s564	Recent	GWAS	completed	for	three	types	of	common	adult	-	onset	glaucoma_have	identified	novel	loci	for	POAG	(	primary	-	open	-	angle	glaucoma	)	(	ABCA1	,	AFAP1	,	GMDS	,	PMM2	,	TGFBR3	,	FNDC3B	,	ARHGEF12	,	GAS7	,	FOXC1	,	ATXN2	,	TXNRD2	)	,	PACG	(	primary	angle	-	closure	glaucoma	(	EPDR1	,	CHAT	,	GLIS3	,	FERMT2	,	DPM2-FAM102	)	,	and	exfoliation	syndrome	(	XFS	)	glaucoma	(	positive_regulation_of_cytosolic_calcium_ion_concentration	)	.	.
s664	Patients	with	intraciliary_retrograde_transport_mutations	can	show	various	extrarenal	manifestations	such	as	skeletal	disorders	,	Caroli	disease	,	and	retinal_dystrophy	,	and	typically	display	nephronophthisis	as	a	renal	phenotype	.	.
s3842	A	founder	mutation	in	positive_regulation_of_GTPase_activity_(KIAA1432	)	was	identified	in	patients	with	cataract	,	brain	atrophy	,	microcephaly_with	or	without	cleft	lip	and	palate	.	.
s3693	However	,	little	is	known	about	the	significance	of	negative_regulation_of_peptidase_activity_expression	in	ESCC.The	mRNA	expression	of	CSTA	was	evaluated	by	qRT	-	PCR	using	28	paired	frozen	samples	of	tumor_and	nontumor	mucosae	.	.
s1331	We	summarize	the	phenotypic	extent	of	smoothened_signaling_pathway/3	syndromes	in	the	literature	and	determine	that	these	2	syndromes	manifest	opposite	features	to	a	certain	extent	,	such	as	midface	hypoplasia	or	macrocephaly	,	and	anterior	or	posterior	side	of	polydactyly	.	.
s28	Similar	to	salubrinal	--	the	phosphomimetic	response_to_endoplasmic_reticulum_stress_variant	--	S51D	--	increased	sensitivity	to	radiation	,	and	both	abrogated	radiation	-	induced	increase	in	breast	cancer_type	1	susceptibility	gene	,	thus	implicating	enhanced	phosphorylation	of	eIF2a	in	modulation	of	DNA	repair	.	.
s2568	Finally	,	the	simultaneous	increase	of	CPT1A	,	CACT	and	CrAT	is	fundamental	for	PCCs	to	sustain	regulation_of_ferrochelatase_activity_oxidation	in	the	presence	of	heavy	lipid	load	on	prostate	cancer_mitochondria	.	.
s340	In	the	remaining	cases	,	next	generation	sequencing	was	carried	out	revealing	variants	in	a	number	of	other	known	complex	spastic_paraplegia_genes	,	including	five	in	regulation_of_mitochondrial_membrane_permeability_(5/97	)	,	four	in	FA2H	(	also	known	as	SPG35	)	(	4/97	)	and	two	in	ZFYVE26/SPG15	Variants	were	identified	in	genes	usually	associated	with	pure	spastic	paraplegia	and	also	in	the	Parkinson	s	disease	-	associated	gene	ATP13A2	,	neuronal	ceroid	lipofuscinosis	gene	TPP1	and	the	hereditary	motor	and	sensory	neuropathy	DNMT1	gene	,	highlighting	the	genetic	heterogeneity	of	spastic	paraplegia	.	.
s2132	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s3075	Furthermore	,	1751	normal	Chinese	individuals	served	as	controls	,	and	122	Chinese	families	segregating	with	apparent	ARNSHL	,	who	had	been	previously	excluded	for	variants	in	the	common	deafness_genes	GJB2	and	regulation_of_pH	,	were	subjected	to	screening	for	candidate	mutations	.	.
s394	These	data	are	consistent	with	the	fact	that	expression	of	breast	cancer_anti	-	estrogen	resistance	1	(	actin_filament_organization	)	was	increased	in	O2	compared	to	V1	cells	(	p	AAAA	0.01	)	.	.
s2449	These	findings	support	that	UNC119	is	a	regulator	of	the	RASSF6-MDM2-DNA_strand_renaturation_axis	and	functions	as	a	tumor_suppressor	.
s1128	In	conclusion	,	autosomal	dominant	mutations	in	response_to_drug	,	a	key	member	of	the	cotranslation	protein	-	targeting	pathway	,	lead	to	syndromic	neutropenia_with	a	Shwachman	-	Diamond	-	like	phenotype	.
s670	Bardet	-	Biedl	syndrome	(	visual_perception	)	is	a	genetically	heterogeneous	disorder	characterized	by	retinal	dystrophy	,	polydactyly	,	obesity	,	developmental_delay	,	and	renal	defects	.	.
s2278	Our	results	suggest	that	HOXB1	functions	as	a	tumor	suppressor	,	regulated	by	protein_polyubiquitination-3175	in	glioma	.	.
s861	Metabolic	cutis	laxa	results	from	Menkes	syndrome	,	caused	by	a	defect	in	the	ATPase	copper	transporting	alpha	(	ATP7A	)	gene	,	congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	due	to	mutations	in	subunit	7	of	the	component	of	oligomeric	Golgi	(	COG7)-congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	(	CDG	)	complex	,	combined	disorder	of	N-	and	O	-	linked	glycosylation	,	due	to	mutations	in	ATPase	H+	transporting	V0	subunit	a2	(	ATP6VOA2	)	gene	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	reductase	1	deficiency	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	synthase	deficiency	,	macrocephaly	,	alopecia	,	cutis	laxa	,	and	scoliosis	(	MACS	)	syndrome	,	due	to	Ras	and	Rab	interactor	2	(	RIN2	)	mutations	,	transaldolase	deficiency	caused	by	mutations	in	the	transaldolase	1	(	TALDO1	)	gene	,	Gerodermia	osteodysplastica	due	to	mutations	in	the	golgin	,	RAB6-interacting	(	GORAB	or	SCYL1BP1	)	gene	,	and	mitogen	-	activated	pathway	(	MAP	)	kinase	defects	,	caused	by	mutations	in	several	genes	[	protein	tyrosine	phosphatase	,	non	-	receptor	-	type	11	(	PTPN11	)	,	RAF	,	NF	,	HRas	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	HRAS	)	,	B	-	Raf	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	BRAF	)	,	MEK1/2	,	KRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	KRAS	)	,	SOS	Ras	/	Rho	guanine	nucleotide	exchange	factor	2	(	SOS2	)	,	leucine	rich	repeat	scaffold	protein	(	SHOC2	)	,	NRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	NRAS	)	,	and	Raf-1	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	activation_of_MAPKK_activity	)	]	,	which	regulate	the	Ras	-	MAPK	cascade	.	.
s4036	We	suggest	that	the	combination	of	reduced	NM23-H1	,	induced	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	and	the	presence	of	tumor_budding	are	promising	biomarkers	for	the	prediction	of	recurrence	and	may	aid	the	stratification	of	patients	with	stage	II	colon	cancer	for	adjuvant	chemotherapy	.
s1858	Hexavalent	chromium	[	positive_regulation_of_cytosolic_calcium_ion_concentration(VI	)	]	damages	DNA	and	causes	cancer	,	but	it	is	unclear	which	DNA	damage	responses	(	DDRs	)	most	critically	protect	cells	from	chromate	toxicity	.	.
s3271	The	Kinesin	family	member	2a	(	mitotic_spindle_organization	)	,	that	belongs	to	the	Kinesin-13	microtubule	depolymerases	,	plays	an	important	role	in	cancer	cell	proliferation	,	migration	and	apoptosis	in	various	types	of	cancer	such	as	gastric	cancer	,	breast	cancer	,	and	squamous	cell	carcinoma	of	the	oral	tongue	,	but	,	its	role	and	mechanism	in	lung_adenocarcinoma_(LUAD	)	is	largely	unknown	.	.
s2662	Zinc	finger	protein	687	(	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	)	,	identified	as	a	C2H2	zinc	finger	protein	,	has	been	found	to	be	mutated	and	upregulated	in	giant	cell	tumor	of	bone	and	acute	myeloid	leukemia	,	suggesting	an	oncogenic	role	for	ZNF687	in	cancer	.	.
s3444	Lack	-	of	-	function	mutations	in	EDC4	were	detected	in	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination/2-mutation	-	negative	breast	cancer_cases	,	suggesting	a	role	in	breast	cancer	susceptibility	.	.
s661	Mutations	in	the	glutaminyl	-	tRNA	synthetase	(	prolyl	-	tRNA_aminoacylation	)	gene	have	been	reported	in	patients	with	progressive	microcephaly	,	cerebral	-	cerebellar_atrophy	,	and	intractable	seizures	.	.
s3940	Increased	expression	of	the	peptidyl	-	tyrosine_phosphorylation_homology	2	B	adaptor	protein	1	(	SH2B1	)	may	stimulate	the	malignant	progression	of	lung	cancer	,	esophageal	cancer	and	neuroblastoma	.	.
s1679	We	can	now	report	that	progressive	ataxia_of	Charolais	cattle	results	from	a	homozygous	single	nucleotide	polymorphism	in	the	coding	region	of	the	anterograde_neuronal_dense_core_vesicle_transport_gene	.	.
s2228	We	previously	demonstrated	that	phospho	-	mTOR	expression	is	associated	with	tumor	aggressiveness	,	therapy	resistance	,	and	lower	mRNA	expression	of	iodide_transport_in	papillary_thyroid_carcinoma_(PTC	)	,	while	phospho	-	S6	(	mTORC1	effector	)	expression	was	associated	with	less	aggressive	clinicopathological	features	.	.
s1499	A	replicative	analysis	of	associations	of	15	SNPs	located	in	the	regions	of	11	genes	(	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	VRK2	,	NOTCH4	,	ZNF804A	,	AGBL1	,	RELN	,	ZFP64P1	,	KCNB2	,	CSMD1	,	CPVL	,	NRIP1	)	and	three	intergenic	regions	(	SLCO6A1/LINCOO491	,	LOC105376248/LOC105376249	,	SPA17/NRGN	)	with	schizophrenia_was	conducted	in	the	Russian	population	of	the	Siberian	region	.	.

s1219	BACKGROUND	Ellis	-	glycoprotein_biosynthetic_process_Creveld	syndrome	is	an	autosomal	recessive	chondro	-	ectodermal_dysplasia_characterized	by	disproportionate	short	stature	,	limb	shortening	,	narrow	chest	,	postaxial	polydactyly	and	dysplastic	nails	and	teeth	.	.
s908	Immunoperoxidase	levels	in	the	tumor_were	positive	for	factor	VIII	and	CD31	and	negative	for	S100	,	protein	Melan	-	A	,	CD34	,	synaptophysin	,	chromogranin	,	desmin	,	muscle	specific	actin	,	fatty_acid_beta	-	oxidation_using_acyl	-	CoA_dehydrogenase_(EMA	)	,	KRT20	(	CK20	)	,	CDX2	,	TTF1	,	LNPEP	(	PLAP	)	,	inhibin	,	?	-fetoprotein	,	CD30	,	hepatocyte	paraffin	,	and	aberrant	expression	of	cytokeratin	7	and	pankeratin	.	.
s841	To	understand	how	mutant	phosphorylation_contributes	to	cancer_cell	proliferation	,	we	used	genome	scale	loss	-	of	-	function	screening	in	a	large	number	of	genomically	annotated	cancer	cell	lines	.	.
s178	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal_recessive_Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	negative_regulation_of_protein_binding	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy	(	SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s101	Here	we	developed	a	novel	whole	-	body	insertional	mutagenesis	screen	in	mice	,	which	was	designed	for	the	discovery	of	negative_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	-	cooperating	tumor_suppressors	.	.
s1629	This	review	reflects	the	existing	positive_regulation_of_cell	-	matrix_adhesion	/	ephrin	literature	while	focusing	on	breast	cancer_heterogeneity	.	.
s1628	Aberrant	expression	of	different	family	members	of	the	positive_regulation_of_cell	-	matrix_adhesion	/	ephrin	system	,	which	comprises	the	Eph	receptors	(	Ephs	)	and	their	ligands	(	ephrins	)	,	has	been	implicated	in	various	malignancies	including	breast	cancer	.	.
s1595	In	addition	to	cellular	miRNAs	,	protein_glycosylationcreted	miRNAs	also	play	important	roles	in	cancer_development	and	metastasis	.	.
s231	Our	data	,	with	previously	published	reports	,	suggest	that	duplications	involving	SHROOM4	and	response_to_oxidative_stress_may	represent	a	new	syndromic	X	-	linked	ID	critical	region	associated	with	mild	to	severe	ID	,	speech	delay	+	/-	dysarthria	,	attention	deficit	disorder	,	precocious	puberty	,	constipation	,	and	motor_delay	.	.
s2835	Overall	,	GPT2	promotes	tumorigenesis	and	stemness	of	breast	cancer_cells	by	activating	the	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_signaling	,	suggesting	that	GTP2	is	a	potential	target	for	breast	cancer	therapy	.
s2700	Mitochondrial	neurogastrointestinal	encephalopathy	(	pyrimidine_nucleoside_metabolic_process	)	,	usually	an	autosomal	-	recessive	inherited	condition	,	causes	gastrointestinal_dysmotility	,	ophthalmoplegia	,	ptosis	,	leukoencephalopathy	and	neuropathy	.	.
s1800	We	studied	the	effect	of	specific	inhibition	of	rRNA	synthesis	on	cell	cycle	progression	in	human	cancer_cell	lines	using	the	small	-	interfering	RNA	procedure	to	silence	the	negative_regulation_of_protein_localization_to_nucleolus_gene	,	which	encodes	the	catalytic	subunit	of	RNA	polymerase	I.	.
s2146	This	study	points	to	the	likely	importance	of	histone	modifications	in	osteosarcoma_and	highlights	the	strong	genetic	similarities	between	human	and	dog	osteosarcoma	,	suggesting	that	canine	osteosarcoma	may	serve	as	an	excellent	model	for	developing	treatment	strategies	in	both	species	.	Significance	,	Canine	osteosarcoma	genomics	identify	regulation_of_double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination_as	a	possible	oncogenic	driver	of	osteosarcoma	,	and	findings	establish	the	canine	model	as	a	useful	comparative	model	for	the	corresponding	human	disease	.	.
s3617	Heterozygous	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_IIH/+	females	showed	no	obvious	abnormalities	before	pregnancy	,	but	when	mated	with	wild	-	type	(	WT	)	males	developed	a	full	spectrum	of	preeclampsia	-	like	phenotypes	,	including	increased	systolic	blood	pressure	,	proteinuria	,	glomerular	endotheliosis	,	and	intrauterine	fetal	growth	restriction	.	.
s2365	The	greater	detection	rate	for	DM+biological_process_was	stronger	for	ductal	carcinoma	in	situ	(	+	180	%	,	95	%	CI	,	1	,	665	)	,	it	was	notable	for	small	and	medium	invasive	cancers	,	but	not	for	large	ones	(	+	94	[	95	%	CI	,	6	,	254	]	,	+	122	[	95	%	CI	,	18	,	316	]	,	-12	[	95	%	CI	,	-68	,	141	]	,	for	invasive	cancers	AAAA	10	mm	,	10	-	19	mm	,	and	G	20	mm	,	respectively	)	.	.
s2719	Using	whole	-	exome	sequencing	in	four	probands	with	undiagnosed	skin	hyperkeratosis	/	ichthyosis	,	we	identified	compound	heterozygosity	for	mutations	in	3-keto	-	sphinganine_metabolic_process	,	encoding	an	enzyme	in	the	de	novo	synthesis	pathway	of	ceramides	.	.
s4042	Defects	of	positive_regulation_of_cytosolic_calcium_ion_concentration	,	calcium-	and	integrin	-	binding	protein	2	,	have	been	reported	to	cause	isolated	deafness	,	DFNB48	and	Usher	syndrome	type	-	IJ	,	characterized	by	congenital	profound	deafness	,	balance	defects	and	blindness	.	.
s962	In	an	additional	affected	individual	with	RHD	and	a	congenital_heart_defect	,	we	found	a	homozygous	loss	-	of	-	function	(	LOF	)	variant	in	axon_guidance	,	recapitulating	phenotypes	reported	with	Slit3	inactivation	in	the	mouse	.	.
s2497	CHD	proteins	play	an	important	role	in	neurodevelopment	,	as	pathogenic	variants	in	covalent_chromatin_modification	,	CHD2	,	CHD4	,	CHD7	and	CHD8	have	been	associated	with	a	range	of	neurological	phenotypes	,	including	autism	spectrum	disorder	(	ASD	)	,	intellectual_disability_(ID	)	and	epilepsy	.	.
s20	The	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination_recombinase	plays	a	central	role	in	homologous	recombination	(	HR	)	,	which	is	critical	for	repair	of	DNA	double	-	strand	breaks	,	maintenance	of	genomic	stability	,	and	prevention	of	developmental	disorders	and	cancer	.	.
s2498	CHD	proteins	play	an	important	role	in	neurodevelopment	,	as	pathogenic	variants	in	CHD1	,	muscle_organ_development	,	CHD4	,	CHD7	and	CHD8	have	been	associated	with	a	range	of	neurological	phenotypes	,	including	autism	spectrum	disorder	(	ASD	)	,	intellectual_disability_(ID	)	and	epilepsy	.	.
s2427	In	this	report	we	describe	a	female	child	with	global	developmental	delay	,	microcephaly	and	myoclonic	seizures_harbouring	a	5	Mb	deletion	in	14q12	locus	resulting	in	deletion	of	single	copy	of	brain	specific	genes	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	,	PRKD1	and	NOVA1	.	.
s1494	This	study	aims	to	determine	the	association	between	FGF10	(	rs4415084	CAAAAT	)	,	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_(rs2981582	CAAAAT	)	and	MAP3K1	(	rs889312	AAAAAC	)	gene	polymorphisms	and	breast	cancer	,	to	analyse	the	discriminative	ability	of	each	SNP	and	to	test	the	accuracy	of	the	predictive	breast	cancer	risk	model	which	includes	all	SNPs	.	.
s331	No	clinical	replication	cohort	is	available	,	so	we	validated	the	role	of	one	of	these	targets	,	positive_regulation_of_blood_vessel_endothelial_cell_migration	,	in	a	pneumococcal	meningitis_mouse	model	.	.
s2335	Only	minor	changes	in	mRNA	transcript	levels	occurred	upon	exposure	to	the	compounds	confirming	that	metabolic	flux	alone	can	be	a	key	determinant	of	sialoglycoconjugate	display	in	breast	cancer_cells	,	this	result	complements	the	well	-	established	role	of	genetic	control	(	e.g.	,	the	transcription	of	glycosphingolipid_metabolic_process	)	of	sialylation	abnormalities	ubiquitously	associated	with	cancer	.	.
s1573	Since	excessive	ingestion	of	vitamin	A	is	known	to	induce	spontaneous_fractures_and	as	the	Vegfa	-	induced	femur	angulation	in	mice	appears	to	be	caused	by	intrauterine	fractures	,	we	analyzed	bones	from	a	xenobiotic_metabolic_process_deficient	human	and	rats	with	hypervitaminosis	A	to	further	explore	Vegfa	as	a	mechanistic	link	for	the	effect	of	vitamin	A	on	bone	.	.
s1316	Fourteen	different	(	half	of	them	novel	)	non	-	gap_junction_assembly_variants	causing	HL	were	found	in	10	genes	(	CHD7	,	HDAC8	,	MITF	,	NEFL	,	OTOF	,	SF3B4	,	SLC26A4	,	TECTA	,	TMPRSS3	,	USH2A	)	among	13	probands	,	confirming	the	genetic	heterogeneity_of	hereditary	HL	.	.
s518	Independently	,	the	same	approach	identified	a	second	homozygous	truncating	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_variant	in	another	multiplex	consanguineous	family	affected	by	severe	myopia	,	retinal_detachment	,	and	milder	skeletal	involvement	.	.
s2347	Some	of	them	were	cancer	-	related	according	to	COSMIC	and	HGMD	databases	(	no	founder	mutations	in	BRCA1	and	mitotic_cytokinesis_have	been	found	)	.	.
s605	Genes	with	DMRs	were	involved	in	inflammatory	response	(	IRAK4	and	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation	)	,	cancer_(BRCA1	and	LASP1	)	,	endocrine	function	(	CNPY1	)	,	and	male	fertility	(	IFT140	,	TESC	,	and	PRDM8	)	.	.
s602	Increased	expression	of	cell_cycle_arrest_was	observed	in	neuroblastoma_cells	homozygous	for	the	rs6441201	risk	allele	(	P	=	0.02	)	,	and	significant	growth	inhibition	was	observed	upon	depletion	of	MLF1	(	P	AAAA	0.0001	)	in	neuroblastoma	cells	.	.
s3950	In	this	study	,	we	generated	GCN2	inhibitors	and	demonstrated	that	inhibition	of	GCN2	sensitizes	cancer_cells	with	low	basal	-	level	expression	of	asparagine	synthetase	(	asparagine_biosynthetic_process	)	to	the	antileukemic	agent	l	-	asparaginase	(	ASNase	)	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	.	.
s3897	We	found	monoallelic	truncating	/	functionally	deleterious	mutations	in	seven	genes	,	including	ATM	and	CHEK2	,	which	have	previously	been	associated	with	PrCa	predisposition	,	and	five	new	candidate	PrCa	associated	genes	involved	in	cancer_predisposing	recessive	disorders	,	namely	DNA_repair	,	FANCD2	,	FANCI	,	CEP57	and	RECQL4	.	.
s2541	Radiographic	hepatic	capsular	invasion	and	nonsmooth	tumor_margins	identified	by	preoperative	CT	images	,	along	with	post	-	translational_protein_modification_levels	greater	than	232.2	ng	/	mL	,	are	important	predictors	of	MVI	.
s3548	In	these	5	families	,	we	detected	one	reported	and	six	novel	mutations	in	5	different	deafness	autosomal_recessive_(DFNB	)	genes	(	TRIOBP	,	LHFPL5	,	CDH23	,	sensory_perception_of_sound	,	and	MYO7A	)	.	.
s1307	These	results	indicated	that	mitochondrial_pyruvate_transmembrane_transport_could	be	a	novel	therapeutic	target	in	some	cancers	.
s3782	In	this	study	,	we	employed	a	siRNA	knockdown	approach	for	heparan	sulphate	(	glycosaminoglycan_biosynthetic_process	)	and	heparan	/	chondroitin	/	dermatan	sulphate	-	biosynthetic	enzymes	(	b4GalT7	)	in	the	aggressive	human	breast	cancer_cell	line	MDA	-	MB-231	to	study	the	impact	on	cell	behaviour	and	hyaluronan	biosynthesis	.	.
s3332	Our	analyses	revealed	that	the	primary	tumor_and	NCC	-	SS1-C1	cell	line	harbored	the	SS18-regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_fusion	gene	typical	of	synovial	sarcoma	and	similar	proteomics	profiles	.	.
s1000	In	this	study	,	we	show	that	microRNA	(	miR)-587	confers	resistance	to	5-fluorouracil	(	5-regulation_of_DNA	-	binding_transcription_factor_activity)-induced	apoptosis	in	vitro	and	reduces	the	potency	of	5-FU	in	the	inhibition	of	tumor_growth	in	a	mouse	xenograft	model	in	vivo	.	.
s2709	The	chromosome	22	disorder	,	due	to	mutations	in	the	nuclear	gene	TYMP	encoding	thymidine	phosphorylase	(	retina_homeostasis	)	,	leads	to	the	accumulation	of	thymidine	and	deoxyuridine	,	with	mitochondrial	dysfunction	.	This	report	describes	a	patient	with	an	MNGIE	-	like	syndrome	with	a	heterozygous	TYMP	mutation	who	showed	marked	,	but	transient	improvement	postallogeneic	haematopoietic	stem	cell	transplantation	(	HSCT).The	patient	,	showing	ptosis_and	ophthalmoplegia	,	was	initially	managed	for	myasthenia	gravis	.	.
s2749	We	report	4	cases	of	acute	severe	VZV	infection	affecting	the	central_nervous	system	or	the	lungs	in	unrelated	,	otherwise	healthy	children	who	are	heterozygous	for	rare	missense	mutations	in	POLR3A	(	one	patient	)	,	positive_regulation_of_interferon	-	beta_production_(one	patient	)	,	or	both	(	two	patients	)	.	.
s1462	Higher	pre	-	NACT	nuclear	response_to_oxidative_stress_I	expression	predicted	smaller	size	of	a	resected	tumor_(p	=	0.00052	,	r	=	-0.550	)	,	and	higher	pre	-	NACT	cytoplasmic	Prx	I	expression	predicted	a	lower	amount	of	evacuated	nodal	metastasis	(	p	=	0.0024	,	r	=	-0.472	)	.	.
s96	Taken	altogether	,	our	study	demonstrates	a	role	of	protein_polyubiquitination-155	in	thiamine	homeostasis	and	suggests	a	function	of	this	oncogenic	miRNA	on	breast	cancer_metabolism	.	.
s92	Transcripts	of	camera	-	type_eye_development	,	a	gene	associated	with	angle	-	closure	glaucoma	,	posterior	microphthalmia	and	myopia	,	were	increased	in	Mfrprd6	eyes	by	17-fold	.	.
s2636	Depletion	of	positive_regulation_of_cell_death_and	GSALDH	in	humans	leads	to	hyperprolinemia	,	which	is	associated	with	mental	disorders	such	as	schizophrenia	.	.
s1053	We	review	the	literature	of	genetic	PD	autopsies	from	cases	with	molecularly	confirmed	PD	or	parkinsonism_and	summarize	main	findings	on	SNCA	(	n	=	25	)	,	Parkin	(	n	=	20	,	17	bi	-	allelic	and	3	heterozygotes	)	,	PINK1	(	n	=	5	,	1	bi	-	allelic	and	4	heterozygotes	)	,	DJ-1	(	n	=	1	)	,	MAPK_cascade_(n	=	55	)	,	GBA	(	n	=	10	Gaucher	disease	patients	with	parkinsonism	)	,	DNAJC13	,	GCH1	,	ATP13A2	,	PLA2G6	(	n	=	8	patients	,	2	with	PD	)	,	MPAN	(	n	=	2	)	,	FBXO7	,	RAB39B	,	and	ATXN2	(	SCA2	)	,	as	well	as	on	22q	deletion	syndrome	(	n	=	3	)	.	.
s3995	To	reveal	novel	molecular	factors	behind	the	development	of	salivary	gland	cancer	,	we	performed	gene	expression	analyses	from	nuclear	-	transcribed_mRNA_poly(A)_tail_shortening	-	Tag	mouse	salivary	gland	samples	.	.
s1311	histone_H3-K4_methylation	-	dystonia_(DYT28	)	is	emerging	as	an	important	and	frequent	cause	of	childhood	-	onset	progressive	generalised	dystonia	and	is	estimated	to	potentially	account	for	up	to	10	%	of	early	-	onset	generalised	dystonia	.	.
s814	In	childhood	tumors	,	including	retinoblastoma	,	osteosarcoma	,	and	neuroblastoma	,	the	regulation_of_lipid_kinase_activity	-	E2F1	pathway	is	inactivated	,	as	a	rule	.	.
s1658	Immunostaining	showed	that	the	colon	cancer_was	positive	for	CDX2	,	SATB2	,	had	a	loss	of	PMS2	and	intact	expression	of	MLH1	,	DNA_repair_and	MSH6	,	negative	for	AMACR	,	while	the	prostate	cancer	was	positive	for	AMACR	,	had	intact	expression	of	PMS2	,	MLH1	,	MSH2	and	MSH6	,	and	negative	for	CDX2	and	SATB2	.	.
s1965	Leucine	-	rich	glioma	-	inactivated	protein	1	(	LGI1	)	is	a	secreted	neuronal	protein	and	a	Nogo	receptor	1	(	cytokine	-	mediated_signaling_pathway	)	ligand	.	.
s1923	Though	a	rare	etiology	,	cell_junction_assembly_gene	should	not	be	excluded	in	early	-	onset	arrhythmia	,	even	in	the	absence	of	myopathy	,	which	occurs	later	in	the	disease	course	.
s3074	Furthermore	,	1751	normal	Chinese	individuals	served	as	controls	,	and	122	Chinese	families	segregating	with	apparent	ARNSHL	,	who	had	been	previously	excluded	for	variants	in	the	common	deafness_genes	gap_junction_assembly_and	SLC26A4	,	were	subjected	to	screening	for	candidate	mutations	.	.
s858	Metabolic	cutis	laxa	results	from	Menkes	syndrome	,	caused	by	a	defect	in	the	ATPase	copper	transporting	alpha	(	ATP7A	)	gene	,	congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	due	to	mutations	in	subunit	7	of	the	component	of	oligomeric	Golgi	(	COG7)-congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	(	CDG	)	complex	,	combined	disorder	of	N-	and	O	-	linked	glycosylation	,	due	to	mutations	in	ATPase	H+	transporting	V0	subunit	a2	(	ATP6VOA2	)	gene	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	reductase	1	deficiency	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	synthase	deficiency	,	macrocephaly	,	alopecia	,	cutis	laxa	,	and	scoliosis	(	MACS	)	syndrome	,	due	to	Ras	and	Rab	interactor	2	(	RIN2	)	mutations	,	transaldolase	deficiency	caused	by	mutations	in	the	transaldolase	1	(	TALDO1	)	gene	,	Gerodermia	osteodysplastica	due	to	mutations	in	the	golgin	,	RAB6-interacting	(	GORAB	or	SCYL1BP1	)	gene	,	and	mitogen	-	activated	pathway	(	MAP	)	kinase	defects	,	caused	by	mutations	in	several	genes	[	protein	tyrosine	phosphatase	,	non	-	receptor	-	type	11	(	PTPN11	)	,	RAF	,	NF	,	HRas	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	HRAS	)	,	B	-	Raf	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	BRAF	)	,	MEK1/2	,	KRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	KRAS	)	,	SOS	Ras	/	Rho	guanine	nucleotide	exchange	factor	2	(	G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway	)	,	leucine	rich	repeat	scaffold	protein	(	SHOC2	)	,	NRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	NRAS	)	,	and	Raf-1	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	RAF1	)	]	,	which	regulate	the	Ras	-	MAPK	cascade	.	.
s112	Our	study	identified	complex	negative_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	-	cooperating	tumor_suppressor	networks	in	different	cancer	types	,	with	potential	clinical	implications	.
s2804	The	PCH1sub	-	types	with	early	death	(	between	ages	1	day	and	17	months	)	,	seen	in	patients	with	p	.	G31A	/	EXOSC3	or	mitochondrial_membrane_fission_mutations	have	a	SMA	type	1-like	clinical	presentation	but	with	global	developmental	delay	,	visual	and	hearing	impairment	,	with	or	without	microcephaly	,	nystagmus	and	optic_atrophy	.	.
s3267	The	results	suggest	a	conditional	regulation	of	aging_gene	by	ATF4	that	may	be	inhibited	in	normal	cells	,	but	engaged	during	cancer_progression	.	.
s2679	Genes	harboring	the	most	significant	mutations	include	PCDH9	,	KLHL12	,	biological_process	,	and	VHL	in	sporadic_HBs	,	and	ZNF814	,	DLG2	,	RIMS1	,	PNN	,	and	MUC7	in	familial	HBs	.	.
s416	We	asked	whether	cell_surface_receptor_signaling_pathway_could	modify	the	phenotype	of	a	PRPH2	mutation	associated	with	a	high	degree	of	intrafamilial	phenotypic	heterogeneity	,	Y141C.	.
s1177	The	present	study	aimed	to	investigate	the	relationship	between	the	expression	of	collagen	and	calcium	-	binding	epidermal	growth	factor	domain	-	containing	protein	1	(	positive_regulation_of_vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_production	)	and	lymphatic	vessel	endothelial	hyaluronan	receptor	1	(	LYVE1	)	in	tumor_tissue	with	the	clinical	prognosis	of	lung	cancer	.	.
s1938	Blocking	the	expression	of	integrin	cell_surface_receptor_signaling_pathwayb1	,	which	was	accomplished	by	transduction	of	a2-specific	shRNA	,	resulted	in	significant	inhibition	of	proliferation	and	clonal	activity	in	human	MCF-7	breast_carcinoma_and	SK	-	Mel-147	melanoma	cells	.	.
s1027	Biallelic	mutations	in	these	genes	cause	Fanconi	anemia	(	FA	)	,	characterized	by	malformations	,	bone	marrow	failure	,	chromosome	fragility	,	and	cancer_predisposition	(	BRCA2/FANCD1	and	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination	/	FANCN	)	,	or	an	FA	-	like	disease	presenting	a	phenotype	similar	to	FA	but	without	bone	marrow	failure	(	BRCA1/FANCS	)	.	.
s935	Recent	research	published	in	the	Journal	of	Pathology	showed	that	genetic	depletion	of	any	of	the	NOX2	subunits	Cyba	,	Cybb	,	Ncf1	,	Ncf2	and	superoxide_metabolic_process_reduced	the	formation	of	lung	metastases	following	intravenous	injection	of	murine	tumor_cells	.	.
s3674	In	addition	,	resorcinol	suppressed	the	expression	of	melanogenic	gene	microphthalmia	-	associated	transcriptional	factor	(	MITF	)	and	its	downstream	target	genes	tyrosinase	,	tyrosinase	-	related	protein	(	positive_regulation_of_melanin_biosynthetic_process)-1	,	and	TRP-2	.	.
s2791	Biallelic	loss	-	of	-	function	mutations	affecting	growth_plate_cartilage_chondrocyte_development_cause	SOFT	syndrome	,	an	ultra	-	rare	condition	characterized	by	short	stature	,	onychodysplasia	,	facial	dysmorphism	and	hypotrichosis	.	.
s2150	Interestingly	,	GTP_metabolic_process_null	allele	homozygosity	in	humans	is	not	lethal	,	but	instead	causes	the	developmental	disorder	Carpenter	s	syndrome	(	CS	)	,	which	is	characterized	by	craniofacial	malformations	,	polysyndactyly	,	obesity_and	intellectual	disability	.	.
s894	By	comparing	the	clinical	and	genetic	features	of	our	patients	with	those	previously	reported	,	we	show	that	the	severity	of	the	neurological	phenotype	and	the	frequency	of	congenital_heart_defects_characterize	the	deletions	that	,	besides	ANKRD11	,	contain	regulation_of_definitive_erythrocyte_differentiation	,	CDH15	and	ZNF778	as	well	.	.
s84	In	Mfrprd6	eyes	,	a	significant	1.5-	to	2.0-fold	decrease	was	observed	among	transcripts	of	genes	linked	to	retinal_degeneration	,	including	those	involved	in	visual	cycle	(	Rpe65	,	Lrat	,	Rgr	)	,	phototransduction	(	Pde6a	,	Guca1b	,	negative_regulation_of_signal_transduction	)	,	and	photoreceptor	disc	morphogenesis	(	Rrelationip1	and	Fscn2	)	.	.
s410	Of	those	,	transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_I_is	also	implicated	in	a	mandibulofacial_dysostosis_syndrome	without	leukodystrophy	as	POLR1A	is	.	.
s2309	We	describe	a	7-year	-	old	with	a	novel	de	novo	missense	mutation	in	protein_import_into_nucleus_associated	with	epilepsy	,	autism_spectrum	disorder	and	global	developmental	delay	.
s1945	However	,	in	HaCaT	and	HEK293	T	cells	that	display	transformed	phenotypes	,	but	do	not	originate	from	patient	-	derived	tumors	,	the	ER	stress	-	inducing	treatments	resulted	in	an	upregulation	of	FAM129A	and	cellular_glucose_homeostasis	,	but	not	KRT16	transcripts	,	By	a	luciferase	reporter	approach	we	identified	a	highly	active	ATF4-responsive	element	within	the	upstream	region	of	the	KRT16	gene	.	.
s3083	De	novo	in	-	frame	deletions	and	duplications	in	the	MAPK_cascade_gene	,	encoding	the	non	-	erythrocyte	aII	spectrin	,	have	been	associated	with	severe	West	syndrome	with	hypomyelination	and	pontocerebellar_atrophy	.	.
s3946	We	further	review	the	variety	of	melanocytic	tumors	associated	with	such	protein_phosphorylation_fusions	.
s708	We	report	a	sibling	pair	with	FTHS	caused	by	a	homozygous	,	novel	mutation	pLys133Glnfs	13	in	the	superoxide_metabolic_process_gene	,	one	sibling	had	bilateral	ocular	hypertension	and	unilateral_colobomas	of	iris	,	choroid	and	retina	,	the	other	,	unilateral	myelinated	nerve	fiber	layer	of	the	optic	disk	and	papilledema	due	to	idiopathic	intracranial	hypertension	.	.
s683	Primary	renal	tricarboxylic_acid_cycle_and	neoplasia_was	associated	with	about	2	%	of	710	cases	of	PC	/	PGL	.	.
s1987	We	found	that	PRMT1	expression	in	tumor_associated	macrophages	correlated	with	regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_activation	in	human	HCC	specimens	.	.
s2554	Expectedly	,	the	analysis	of	the	DEGs	common	to	all	three	alterations	highlighted	a	group	of	BioFunctions	that	included	Cell	Proliferation	of	tumor_cell	lines	(	14	DEGs	)	,	Invasion	of	cells	(	10	DEGs	)	and	Migration	of	tumour	cell	lines	(	10	DEGs	)	,	with	a	common	core	of	5	genes	(	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	CDKN1A	,	GDF15	,	HBEGF	and	LCN2	)	that	likely	represent	downstream	effectors	of	the	pro	-	oncogenic	activities	of	PI3K	/	AKT	signalling	.	.
s616	On	the	other	hand	,	MYH1	,	MYH2	,	MYH3	,	MYH7	,	MYH8	,	FOXO3	,	NFATC1	,	PTGS2	,	histone_acetylation	,	HDAC4	,	and	RUNX2	expression	is	suspected	to	be	involved	in	the	epigenetic	regulations	behind	the	mandibular	prognathism_phenotype	.
s2932	Whole	exome	sequencing	of	the	patient	and	his	parents	ruled	out	mutations	in	11	known	hypodontia	-	associated	genes	including	WNT10A	,	MSX1	,	EDA	,	EDAR	,	EDARADD	,	PAX9	,	cellular_protein_localization	,	GREM2	,	NEMO	,	KRT17	,	and	TFAP2B.	.
s2341	In	this	study	,	we	describe	a	pathogenic	missense	mutation	in	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_in	a	four	-	generation	Chinese	family	(	6126	)	with	midfrequency	,	progressive	,	and	postlingual	autosomal	dominant	nonsyndromic	hearing_loss_(ADNSHL	)	.	.
s631	Mutations	and	deletions	of	the	interleukin-1	receptor	accessory	protein	like	1	(	regulation_of_postsynapse_organization	)	gene	,	located	on	the	X	chromosome	,	are	associated	with	intellectual_disability_(ID	)	and	autism	spectrum	disorder	(	ASD	)	.	.
s275	p21-activated	kinase	4	(	positive_regulation_of_angiogenesis	)	has	been	shown	to	regulate	many	cellular	processes	in	cancer_cells	,	including	migration	,	polarization	and	proliferation	.	.
s2585	Genetic	studies	on	consanguineous	families	with	primary	microcephaly_have	identified	15	(	MCPH	)	causative	genes	that	include	MCPH1	,	WDR62	,	CDK5RAP2	,	CASC5	,	ASPM	,	centriole_elongation	,	STIL	,	CEP135	,	CEP152	,	ZNF335	,	PHC1	,	CDK6	,	CENPE	,	SASS6	MFSD2A	ANKLE2	and	CIT	(	Khan	et	al	.	2014	,	Yamamoto	et	al	.	2014	,	Alakbarzade	et	al	.	2015,Morris	-	Rosendahl	and	Kaindl	2015	,	Basit	et	al	.	2016	)	.	.
s2353	Using	whole	-	exome	sequencing	,	we	identified	compound	heterozygous	positive_regulation_of_mitochondrial_translation_variants	in	a	4-year	-	old	patient	with	congenital	lactic	acidosis	,	severe	myopathy	,	hearing_loss	,	renal	failure	,	and	dysautonomia	.	.
s1933	TDP1	plays	an	essential	role	in	the	resistance	of	cancer_cells	to	currently	used	antitumour	drugs	based	on	DNA_topological_change_inhibitors	such	as	topotecan	and	irinotecan	.	.
s3067	Missense	mutations	of	the	human	mitochondrial	citrate	carrier	,	encoded	by	the	mitochondrial_citrate_transmembrane_transport_gene	,	lead	to	an	autosomal	recessive	neurometabolic	disorder	characterised	by	neonatal	-	onset	encephalopathy	with	severe	muscular	weakness	,	intractable	seizures	,	respiratory	distress	,	and	lack	of	psychomotor	development	,	often	resulting	in	early	death	.	.
s3943	The	aims	of	the	present	study	were	to	evaluate	the	relation	of	dysregulated	MACC1	,	c	-	endothelial_cell_morphogenesis	,	and	NM23-H1	expression	with	the	histopathological	features	of	tumors	in	recurrence	formation	in	eCC	cases	.	.
s1029	Biallelic	mutations	in	these	genes	cause	Fanconi	anemia	(	regulation_of_ferrochelatase_activity	)	,	characterized	by	malformations	,	bone	marrow	failure	,	chromosome	fragility	,	and	cancer_predisposition	(	BRCA2/FANCD1	and	PALB2/FANCN	)	,	or	an	FA	-	like	disease	presenting	a	phenotype	similar	to	FA	but	without	bone	marrow	failure	(	BRCA1/FANCS	)	.	.
s2025	To	search	for	the	underlying	molecular	mechanism	,	we	turned	to	examine	the	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_of	CBX3	on	the	expression	of	FBP1	,	a	negative	regulator	of	aerobic	glycolysis	in	pancreatic	cancer_and	indicated	that	CBX3	negatively	regulated	FBP1	expression	.	.
s4005	In	this	study	,	we	evaluated	the	anticancer_effect	of	ONO-7579	using	GBC	cells	with	or	without	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_mutant	,	NOZ	,	TYGBK-1	.	.
s3684	The	most	frequent	hearing_loss_associated	allele	detected	in	this	population	was	the	235delC	variant	in	gap_junction_assembly_gene	.	.
s3698	Furthermore	,	negative_regulation_of_peptidase_activity_expression	was	observed	in	all	22	lymph	node	metastases	analyzed	.	Relatively	high	levels	of	CSTA	expression	in	tumors	were	correlated	with	tumor	progression	and	advanced	cancer	stage	,	including	lymph	node	metastasis	.
s3926	More	deleterious	proteolysis_variants	,	defined	as	having	impaired	protein	secretion	and	induction	of	endoplasmic	reticulum	(	ER	)	stress	in	transfected	HEK	293	T	cells	,	were	found	in	the	hospital	series	of	pancreatic	cancer_cases	(	5/986	,	0.5	%	)	than	in	controls	(	0/1,045	,	P	=	0.027	)	.	.
s3711	Our	results	suggest	that	PPM1B	plays	a	negative	role	in	the	activation	of	the	p38-RB1-regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_pathway	and	that	targeting	PPM1B	could	be	useful	in	certain	types	of	cancer_by	stimulating	chemotherapy	-	induced	cell	death	.
s3337	Corresponding	implicated	genes	,	such	as	TNNI3	K	,	ErbB3	,	MKL2	,	glucose_homeostasis_and	PRKD1	,	may	explain	the	associations	between	reproductive	factors	and	heart_failure	.	.
s3845	We	report	two	further	candidates	that	are	biallelically	inactivated	each	in	a	single	cataract_family	,	transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_I_(cataract	with	global	developmental	delay	)	and	WDR87	(	non	-	syndromic	cataract	)	.	.
s1380	The	contiguous	deletion	of	NDP	and	its	neighbouring	genes	,	MAOA	/	B	and	cellular_response_to_leukemia_inhibitory_factor	,	reportedly	leads	to	syndromic	clinical	features	such	as	microcephaly	,	intellectual_disability	,	and	epilepsy	.	.
s3790	Oral	cancer_was	associated	with	two	new	regions	,	2p23.3	(	rs6547741	,	biological_process	)	and	9q34.12	(	rs928674	,	LAMC3	)	,	and	with	known	cancer	-	related	loci-9p21.3	(	rs8181047	,	CDKN2B	-	AS1	)	and	5p15.33	(	rs10462706	,	CLPTM1L	)	.	.
s2728	However	,	certain	chromatin	remodeling	genes	(	MLL1	,	MLL2	,	MLL3	,	BAP1	,	PBRM1	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	and	ATRX	)	were	found	to	be	mutated	in	7/22	(	32	%	)	of	intraductal	tubulopapillary	neoplasms	and	27	%	harbored	phosphatidylinositol	3-kinase	(	PI3	K	)	pathway	(	PIK3CA	,	PIK3CB	,	INPP4A	,	and	PTEN	)	mutations	.	.
s745	Hyper	-	methylated	CpG	loci	included	the	known	the	tumor_suppressor	gene	RET	(	p	=	5.72	x	10	-	10	)	,	as	well	as	loci	in	differentially	methylated	regions	for	GSG1L	,	MIR4493	,	NTNG1	,	regulation_of_mitotic_cell_cycle	,	ZNF568	,	and	RERG	.	.
s2715	Recently	,	mitochondrial_transport_recessive	mutations	were	also	found	in	two	sporadic_children	with	hereditary	sensory	-	autonomic	neuropathy	(	HSAN	)	.	.
s2918	Activation	of	GPER	and	its	downstream	signaling	MAPK	/	angiogenesis	,	not	PI3K	/	AKT	,	led	to	enhanced	TRIM2	protein	levels	and	affected	the	binding	between	TRIM2	and	Bim	which	resulted	in	a	reduced	Bim	in	TAM	-	resistant	breast	cancer_cells	.	.
s2967	A	plethora	of	human	diseases	are	associated	with	mutations	in	the	genes	encoding	human	SLC26	transporters	,	including	chondrodysplasias	with	varying	severity	in	sulfate_transmembrane_transport_(~50	mutations	,	27	point	mutations	)	,	congenital	chloride	-	losing	diarrhea	in	SLC26A3	(	~70	mutations	,	31	point	mutations	)	and	Pendred	Syndrome	or	deafness	autosomal_recessive_type	4	in	SLC26A4	(	~500	mutations	,	203	point	mutations	)	.	.
s2134	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	spermatogenesis	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s1815	We	studied	the	expression	of	TMEM9	and	its	effect	on	cytokine	secretion	in	tumor_necrosis	factor	-	alpha	(	protein_import_into_nucleus,_translocation	-	a)-induced	LX-2	cells	.	.
s1005	Knockdown	of	PPP2R1B	expression	increases	AKT	phosphorylation	,	which	leads	to	elevated	positive_regulation_of_protein_ubiquitination_expression	and	enhanced	5-FU	resistance	,	whereas	rescue	of	PPP2R1B	expression	in	miR-587-expressing	cells	decreases	AKT	phosphorylation	/	XIAP	expression	,	re	-	sensitizing	colon	cancer_cells	to	5-FU	-	induced	apoptosis	.	.
s1699	We	surveyed	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_expression	in	24	hepatoblastomas	using	RNA	in	situ	hybridization	and	immunohistochemistry	.	.
s1792	Epidemiology	studies	also	showed	a	strong	association	of	DNA_dealkylation_involved_in_DNA_repair_SNPs	and	overweight	/	obesity_with	increased	risk	of	various	types	of	cancers	.	.
s1870	The	protein	expression	of	IRAK1	and	downstream	molecules	tumor_necrosis	factor	receptor	-	associated	factor	6	(	TRAF6	)	,	inhibitor	of	nuclear	factor	kappa	-	B	kinase	(	IKK	)	,	peripheral_nervous_system_development	-	kappa	-	B	inhibitor	alpha	(	IKBa	)	,	and	NF	-	kB	was	detected	by	Western	-	blot	analysis	.	.
s3547	In	these	5	families	,	we	detected	one	reported	and	six	novel	mutations	in	5	different	deafness	autosomal_recessive_(DFNB	)	genes	(	TRIOBP	,	LHFPL5	,	calcium_ion_transport	,	PCDH15	,	and	MYO7A	)	.	.
s3125	Herein	,	we	performed	comparative	quantitative	proteomics	on	whole	plasma	sampled	from	patients	with	stable	angina	(	inflammatory_response	)	,	acute	myocardial_infarction_(MI	)	,	and	healthy	control	subjects	(	Ctrl	)	.	.
s955	We	compared	the	distribution	and	localization	of	UC	and	esterified	cholesterol	(	EC	)	,	the	age	-	related	macular_degeneration_(AMD	)	associated	regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	/	Fibulin3	(	Fib3	)	,	and	levels	of	acyl	-	coenzyme	A	(	CoA	)	,	cholesterol	acyltransferases	(	ACAT	)	ACAT1	,	ACAT2	and	Apolipoprotein	B	(	ApoB	)	in	ARPE-19	cells	cultured	in	serum	-	supplemented	and	serum	-	free	media	.	.
s2718	The	18	new	diagnoses	made	with	WGS	included	structural	and	non	-	exonic	sequence	variants	not	detectable	with	whole	-	exome	sequencing	,	and	confirmed	recent	disease	associations	with	the	genes	PIGG	,	RNU4ATAC	,	negative_regulation_of_fat_cell_differentiation	,	and	UNC13A.ConclusionWGS	as	a	primary	clinical	test	provided	a	higher	diagnostic	yield	than	conventional	genetic	testing	in	a	clinically	heterogeneous_cohort	.
s980	Two	novel	heterozygous	missense	mutations	in	negative_regulation_of_centrosome_duplication	,	p	.	S222P	(	c.664TAAAAC	)	and	p	.	S532R	(	c.1596CAAAAT	)	,	were	identified	,	1	in	each	patient	with	apparently	sporadic_ALS	.	.
s2327	A	prognostication	scoring	system	was	established	based	on	the	expression	levels	of	RNASEH2A-	,	CDK1-	,	and	positive_regulation_of_cell_migration	-	related	genes	,	which	could	effectively	predict	the	overall	survival	in	a	TCGA	clear	cell	RCC	cohort	(	n	=	533	,	995.3	versus	2242.2	days	,	p	AAAA	0.0001	)	,	in	another	clear_cell_renal_cell_carcinoma_(ccRCC	)	cohort	E	-	GEOD-22541	(	n	=	44	,	390.0	versus	1889.2	days	,	p	=	0.0007	)	,	and	in	a	TCGA	papillary	RCC	(	pRCC	)	cohort	(	n	=	287	,	741.6	versus	1623.7	days	,	p	AAAA	0.0001	)	.	.
s1899	Heterozygous	de	novo	NALCN	missense	variants	in	the	S5/positive_regulation_of_RNA_polymerase_II_transcriptional_preinitiation_complex_assembly_pore	-	forming	segments	lead	to	congenital	contractures	of	the	limbs	and	face	,	hypotonia	,	and	developmental_delay_(CLIFAHDD	,	OMIM	616266	)	with	some	clinical	overlap	.	.
s4029	In	summary	,	we	described	four	cases	of	SMARCB1/nucleosome_disassembly	-	deficient	sinonasal	carcinoma	with	detailed	clinicopathological	data	indicating	that	these	tumors	can	be	regarded	as	a	distinct	entity	with	aggressive	behaviour	.	.
s3222	The	mRNA	and	protein	levels	of	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_are	significantly	up	-	regulated	in	human	breast	cancer_compared	with	matched	adjacent	non	-	cancer	tissues	.	.
s2559	Expectedly	,	the	analysis	of	the	DEGs	common	to	all	three	alterations	highlighted	a	group	of	BioFunctions	that	included	Cell	Proliferation	of	tumor	cell	lines	(	14	DEGs	)	,	Invasion	of	cells	(	10	DEGs	)	and	Migration	of	tumour_cell	lines	(	10	DEGs	)	,	with	a	common	core	of	5	genes	(	ATF3	,	CDKN1A	,	GDF15	,	HBEGF	and	LCN2	)	that	likely	represent	downstream	effectors	of	the	pro	-	oncogenic	activities	of	phosphorylation	/	AKT	signalling	.	.
s1935	Since	then	,	a	number	of	novel	,	small	-	molecule	inhibitors	directed	against	the	phosphorylation_receptor	have	demonstrated	superiority	over	standard	chemotherapies	in	the	treatment	of	ALK	rearrangement	-	positive	lung	cancer	.	.
s2363	Purpose	To	compare	digital	mammography	(	DM	)	plus	digital	breast	tomosynthesis	(	biological_process	)	versus	DM	alone	for	breast	cancer_screening	in	the	Reggio	Emilia	Tomosynthesis	trial	,	a	two	-	arm	test	-	and	-	treat	randomized	controlled	trial	.	.
s2619	Mutations	in	the	immunoglobulin	superfamily	,	member	1	gene	(	IGSF1/regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	)	cause	an	X	-	linked	form	of	central_hypothyroidism	.	.
s3828	In	tumors	with	high	PIK3R2	expression	,	and	independently	of	PIK3CA	,	KRAS	,	or	PTEN	mutations	,	PIK3R2	depletion	induced	lung	SQCC	xenograft	regression	without	triggering	PI3K	/	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_pathway	rebound	.	.
s1115	We	expand	the	knowledge	about	TTC7A	deficiency	,	describing	a	patient	with	the	mild	phenotype	of	TTC7A	deficiency	but	presenting	overlapping	features	of	negative_regulation_of_protein_export_from_nucleus	/	THE	and	MIA	-	CID	,	intestinal_atresia_and	inflammatory	bowel	disease	evocative	of	MIA	-	CID	,	but	also	dental	abnormalities	,	huge	forehead	,	liver	abnormalities	,	autoimmune	thyroiditis	and	hypogammaglobulinemia	,	evocative	of	SD	/	THE	.
s1484	The	negative_regulation_of_protein_export_from_nucleus_mutations	also	caused	loss	of	transcriptional	repression	of	BRCA1-regulated	estrogen	metabolism	genes	CYP1A1	and	CYP3A4	,	breast	epithelial	cells	edited	to	create	heterozygous	loss	of	BARD1	showed	significantly	higher	expression	of	CYP1A1	and	CYP3A4	Reintroduction	of	wild	-	type	BARD1	into	these	cells	restored	CYP1A1	and	CYP3A4	transcription	to	normal	levels	,	but	introduction	of	the	cancer	-	predisposing	BARD1	RING	mutants	failed	to	do	so	.	.
s3885	In	conclusion	,	we	have	identified	a	putative	functional	indel	variant	at	chr13q22.1	that	associates	with	decreased	rRNA_catabolic_process_expression	in	carriers	of	pancreatic	cancer_risk	-	increasing	alleles	,	and	could	therefore	affect	nuclear	RNA	processing	and/or	decay	.
s3295	In	conclusion	,	our	data	suggested	an	essential	role	of	negative_regulation_of_kinase_activity_in	the	tumorgenesis	of	breast	cancer	.	.
s1285	This	data	supports	the	notion	that	suppressed	transcription,_DNA	-	templated_expression	and	changes	in	local	availability	of	thyroid	hormones	might	favor	a	shift	from	a	differentiated	to	a	more	proliferation	-	prone	state	of	cancer_tissues	and	cell	lines	.
s286	As	the	striking	syndactyly_observed	in	the	present	case	is	typical	for	FLPIS	,	we	suggest	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_analysis	in	saliva	samples	for	FLPIS	syndrome	cases	in	which	no	causal	CKAP2L	variant	is	detected	.
s2615	RNA	sequencing	and	quantitative	PCR	show	that	cells	and	EVs	from	vemurafenib	-	treated	cell	cultures	and	tumor_tissues	harvested	from	cell	-	derived	and	patient	-	derived	xenografts	harbor	unique	protein_polyubiquitinationNAs	,	especially	increased	expression	of	miR-211	-	5p	.	.
s449	Biallelic	PARS2	or	asparaginyl	-	tRNA_aminoacylation_mutations	are	reported	to	cause	Alpers	_	syndrome	,	which	is	an	autosomal	recessive	neurodegenerative	disorder	characterized	by	psychomotor	regression	and	epilepsy_with	variable	degree	of	liver	involvement	.	.
s2515	Extensive	search	of	the	literature	revealed	a	potential	key	role	of	genes	at	the	identified	porcine	loci	in	tumor_invasion	(	DST	,	PLEKHA5	,	negative_regulation_of_Wnt_signaling_pathway	,	LIMK2	and	ETV5	)	and	immune	response	modulation	(	ETV5	,	HERC3	and	DICER1	)	of	the	progression	phenotypes	.	.
s1502	A	replicative	analysis	of	associations	of	15	SNPs	located	in	the	regions	of	11	genes	(	TCF4	,	VRK2	,	NOTCH4	,	positive_regulation_of_gene_expression	,	AGBL1	,	RELN	,	ZFP64P1	,	KCNB2	,	CSMD1	,	CPVL	,	NRIP1	)	and	three	intergenic	regions	(	SLCO6A1/LINCOO491	,	LOC105376248/LOC105376249	,	SPA17/NRGN	)	with	schizophrenia_was	conducted	in	the	Russian	population	of	the	Siberian	region	.	.
s1256	Gene	mutations	in	the	cell_activation_and	IGF2	genes	have	been	described	in	patients	presenting	intrauterine	growth	retardation	and	postnatal	short_stature	.	.
s2350	In	this	study	,	we	investigated	the	anticancer_activity	of	cellular_iron_ion_homeostasis-673451	,	a	potent	and	selective	inhibitor	of	PDGFRb	,	on	NSCLC	cell	lines	(	A549	and	H358	)	and	the	potential	mechanism	.	.
s208	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal	recessive	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy_(SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	antigen_receptor	-	mediated_signaling_pathway	/	ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s3570	Objective	,	To	explore	the	expression	of	long	noncoding	RNA	(	lncRNA	)	HOXA11-positive_regulation_of_T_cell_mediated_cytotoxicity_in	esophageal	squamous_cell_carcinoma_tissues	and	the	relationship	of	HOXA11-AS	level	with	clinical	outcomes	.	.
s1287	We	recently	found	that	ER_to_Golgi_vesicle	-	mediated_transport_is	a	principal	triglyceride	hydrolase	in	the	central_nervous	system	(	CNS	)	and	that	genetic	deletion	of	this	enzyme	in	mice	leads	to	ectopic	lipid	droplet	(	LD	)	accumulation	in	neurons	throughout	the	brain	.	.
s1222	BACKGROUND	Ellis	-	glycoprotein_biosynthetic_process_Creveld	syndrome	is	an	autosomal	recessive	chondro	-	ectodermal	dysplasia	characterized	by	disproportionate	short	stature	,	limb	shortening	,	narrow_chest	,	postaxial	polydactyly	and	dysplastic	nails	and	teeth	.	.
s1770	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	flagellated_sperm_motility	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s1578	Mice	with	a	homozygous	null	mutation	in	cellular_sodium_ion_homeostasis_(Nhe1	)	exhibited	ataxia	,	recurrent	seizures	,	and	selective	neuronal	cell	death	.	.
s1512	The	present	study	confirmed	associations	of	KCNB2	rs2247572	,	startle_response_rs2616984	,	and	intergenic	rs12807809	located	in	SPA17/NRGN	with	schizophrenia	.	.
s2533	Smith	-	Magenis	syndrome	(	SMS	)	,	a	neurodevelopmental	disorder	characterized	by	dysmorphic	features	,	intellectual_disability_(ID	)	,	and	sleep	disturbances	,	results	from	a	17p11.2	microdeletion	or	a	mutation	in	the	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_gene	.	.
s3760	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	-	knockout	mice	showed	syndactyly_and	poliosis	in	the	limb	.	.
s600	Recent	prevalent	research	topic	concentrated	in	the	three	neighboring	genes	of	FTO	,	RrelationIP1L	,	IRX3_and_gonad_development	,	as	having	a	functional	link	between_obesity	-	associated	common	variants	within	FTO	and	the	observed	human	phenotypes	.	.
s3259	Knockdown	of	mannose_metabolic_process_in	RCC	cells	inhibited	cancer_cell	migration	and	invasion	,	indicating	overexpression	of	PMM2	could	promote	malignancy	.	.

G31A	/	EXOSC3	or	SLC25A46	mutations	have	a	spliceosomal_snRNP_assembly_type	1-like	clinical	presentation	but	with	global	developmental	delay	,	visual	and	hearing	impairment	,	with	or	without	microcephaly	,	nystagmus	and	optic_atrophy	.	.
s650	IL17RD	expression	was	increased	in	ulcerative	colitis	cancers	,	and	miR-193a-3p	treatment	decreased	growth	and	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_signaling	of	HCT116	cells	in	xenografts	expressing	both	IL17RD	with	WT	3	UTR	compared	with	cells	expressing	IL17RD	with	mutant	3	UTR.Conclusions	,	miR-193a-3p	is	downregulated	in	ulcerative	colitis	neoplasia	,	and	its	loss	promotes	carcinogenesis	through	upregulation	of	IL17RD	.	.
s4045	To	reveal	novel	molecular	factors	behind	the	development	of	salivary	gland	cancer	,	we	performed	gene	expression	analyses	from	nuclear	-	transcribed_mRNA_poly(A)_tail_shortening	-	Tag	mouse	salivary	gland	samples	.	.

s4081	Approximately	one	-	third	of	pediatric	malignant	rhabdoid	tumors	are	linked	to	germline	SWI	/	SNF	alterations	(	SMARCB1/nucleosome_disassembly	,	rarely	SMARCA4	)	resulting	in	occasional	familial	clustering	of	these	highly	aggressive	malignancies	(	so	-	called	rhabdoid	tumor	predisposition	syndrome	,	RTPS	,	types	1	and	2	,	respectively	)	.	.
s1744	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	epithelial_cell_maturation	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s488	Recently	,	mutations	in	biological_process_were	reported	in	two	maternal	half	-	brothers	,	presenting	with	nephrocalcinosis	,	midface	hypoplasia	and	,	in	one	of	the	siblings	,	deafness	and	elliptocytosis	.	.
s2410	Neurotrophins	and	their	receptors	might	regulate	cell	survival	in	head	and	neck	squamous_cell_carcinoma_(HNSCC	)	.	mRNA	expression	of	nerve	growth	factor	(	extrinsic_apoptotic_signaling_pathway_via_death_domain_receptors	)	and	protein	synthesis	of	high	(	NTRK1	)	and	low	affinity	neurotrophin	(	p75	neurotrophin	receptor	,	NTR	)	receptors	were	investigated	in	normal	oral	mucosa	and	in	HNSCC	.	.
s824	The	prognostic	significance	and	performance	of	proline_biosynthetic_process_mRNA	were	validated	on	13	worldwide	independent	microarray	data	sets	,	composed	of	2500	assessable	breast	cancer_cases	.	.
s3062	Our	data	implicate	rare	variants	in	the	AGS	genes	adenosine_to_inosine_editing_and	RNASEH2B	and	a	type	I	interferon	signature	in	glioma	and	prostate	carcinoma	risk	and	tumorigenesis	,	consistent	with	a	genetic	basis	underlying	inflammation	-	driven	malignant	transformation	in	glioma	and	prostate	carcinoma	development	.
s1445	While	defense_response_to_bacterium_markedly	enhanced	the	proliferation	and	reduced	apoptosis	of	Epo	-	dependent	UT-7/Epo	leukemia	cells	,	it	did	not	affect	tumor_cell	proliferation	or	the	cisplatin	-	induced	apoptosis	of	NSCLC	cells	.	.
s499	While	polyglutamine	ataxias	,	linked	to	CAG	repeat	expansions	in	genes	such	as	ATXN1	,	ATXN2	,	ATXN3	,	ATXN7	,	positive_regulation_of_cytosolic_calcium_ion_concentration_and	TBP	,	have	been	extensively	characterized	in	large	cohorts	,	there	is	a	need	for	comprehensive	assessment	of	frequency	and	phenotype	of	more	_	conventional	_	ataxias	.	.
s25	We	extended	our	findings	to	protein_phosphorylation_WT	tumor_cell	lines	that	are	intrinsically	resistant	to	vemurafenib	and	dabrafenib	.	.
s790	Through	genetic	mapping	of	disease	loci	and	whole	-	exome	sequencing	in	four	unrelated	multiplex	families	presenting	with	severe	AMC	,	we	identified	biallelic	loss	-	of	-	function	mutations	in	regulation_of_myelination_(leucine	-	rich	glioma	-	inactivated	4	)	.	.
s3469	Here	,	we	use	a	combination	of	genetic	mouse	models	to	demonstrate	that	camera	-	type_eye_development_mutations	leading	to	reduced	ocular	size	and	hyperopia_act	via	a	loss	of	function	mechanism	.	.
s1886	Encapsulation	of	mirin	in	nanoparticles	allowed	its	use	on	positive_regulation_of_gene_expression	-	amplified	neuroblastoma_xenografts	in	vivo	,	which	resulted	in	a	sharp	impairment	of	tumor	growth	,	associated	with	DDR	activation	,	p53	accumulation	,	and	cell	death	.	.
s1957	In	recent	years	,	high	-	throughput	sequencing	has	been	used	to	analyze	exomes	of	virtually	all	human	tumors	,	which	allowed	to	construct	phylogenetic	trees	of	clonal	cancer	evolution	with	special	emphasis	on	driver	mutations	in	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation-4	genes	.	.
s2650	Purposeregulation_of_synaptic_vesicle_exocytosis_deficiency	causes	neonatal	hypotonia	,	ptosis	,	neonatal	feeding	difficulties	,	childhood	obesity	,	xerostomia	,	and	growth	hormone	deficiency	.	.
s2942	Two	pairwise	genetic	interactions	(	B	cell	lymphocyte	kinase	(	BLK	)	rs13277113,B	cell	scaffold	protein	with	ankyrin	repeats	1	(	BANK1	)	rs3733197and	BLK	rs13277113	membrane	metalloendopeptidase	like	1	(	MMEL1)/	tumor_necrosis	factor	receptor	superfamily	member	14	(	positive_regulation_of_cytokine_secretion_involved_in_immune_response	)	rs3890745	)	have	been	demonstrated	in	determining	susceptibility	to	rheumatoid	arthritis	(	RA	)	without	replication	,	thus	this	study	was	performed	to	examine	whether	abovementioned	genetic	polymorphisms	were	associated	with	RA	and	further	tests	were	performed	to	see	whether	aforementioned	genetic	interactions	existed	in	RA	among	Chinese	population	.	.
s1917	Finally	,	we	will	discuss	the	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_of	faulty	DPC	repair	on	disease	and	cancer_therapy	.
s2378	The	regulation_of_proteasomal_protein_catabolic_process-67	positive	index	of	tumor_varied	from	less	than	2	%	(	51.4	%	)	,	3	%	to	10	%	(	41.3	%	)	to	AAAA10	%	(	7.2	%	)	.	.
s4007	In	conclusion	,	our	results	reveal	a	role	for	the	cellular_response_to_drug_potassium	channel	in	the	regulation	of	human	growth	,	and	show	that	growth	hormone	deficiency	associated	with	maternally	inherited	gingival_fibromatosis_is	an	allelic	disorder	with	cardiac	arrhythmia	syndromes	caused	by	KCNQ1	mutations	.
s2465	Moreover	,	we	show	that	most	SCLC	tumors	can	be	classified	into	one	of	three	lineages	based	on	the	expression	of	negative_regulation_by_host_of_viral_transcription	,	ASCL1	,	or	NEUROD1	.	.
s3151	miR-25	-	3p	,	miR-30a-5p	,	miR-328	and	miR-363	-	3p	directly	targeted	adhesion	-	related	genes	,	including	COL5A1	,	COL11A1	,	ITGA5	,	MMP16	and	negative_regulation_of_angiogenesis	.	miR-363	-	3p	and	miR-328	inhibited	proliferation	of	renal	cancer_cells	,	while	miR-25	-	3p	inhibited	adhesion	,	promoted	proliferation	and	migration	of	renal	cancer	cells	.	.
s185	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal_recessive_Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy	(	SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/antigen_receptor	-	mediated_signaling_pathway	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s4006	Models	were	constructed	using	DNA_replication	-	dependent_nucleosome_assembly	-	knockdown	cells	and	investigated	for	tumor_growth	and	pathological	changes	.	.
s826	Our	findings	revealed	that	both	proline_biosynthetic_process_mRNA	and	protein	expression	were	significantly	associated	with	tumor	size	,	grade	and	invasive	molecular	subtypes	of	breast	cancers	.	.
s3890	The	expression	of	hepatocyte	cell	adhesion	molecule	(	cell_cycle_arrest	)	,	a	novel	tumor_suppressor	,	is	frequently	downregulated	or	lost	in	PCa	.	.
s971	microRNAs	have	been	reported	to	play	vital	role	in	lung	cancer_proliferation	and	metastasis	,	the	role	of	protein_polyubiquitination-4326	in	tumor	progression	has	not	been	studied	.	.
s943	Progressive	multifocal	leukoencephalopathy_(response_to_hypoxia	)	is	a	lethal	brain	disease	caused	by	uncontrolled	replication	of	JC	polyomavirus	(	JCV	)	.	.
s3409	Backgorund	,	Sanjad	-	Sakati	syndrome	(	SSS	)	is	a	rare	autosomal_recessive_disease	caused	by	a	deletion	mutation	(	155	-	166del	)	in	exon	3	of	the	post	-	chaperonin_tubulin_folding_pathway_gene	on	chromosome	1q42	-	43	.	.
s689	Cystinuria	is	a	heterogeneous	,	rare	but	important	cause	of	inherited	kidney	stone	disease	due	to	mutations	in	2	genes	,	SLC3A1	and	neutral_amino_acid_transport	.	.
s751	Here	de	novo	missense	mutations	in	the	RPS23	gene	,	which	codes	for	uS12	,	are	reported	in	two	unrelated	individuals	with	microcephaly	,	hearing_loss	,	and	overlapnegative_regulation_of_endopeptidase_activityng	dysmorphic	features	.	.
s1748	We	phenotyped	a	large	population	of	typical	individuals	for	schizophrenia	-	spectrum	and	autism	-	spectrum	traits	,	and	genotyped	them	for	the	single	-	nucleotide	polymorphism	rs850807	,	which	is	putatively	functional	and	linked	with	Arp2/3_complex	-	mediated_actin_nucleation_and	NDN	Genetic	variation	in	rs850807	was	strongly	and	exclusively	associated	with	the	ideas	of	reference	subscale	of	the	schizophrenia	spectrum	,	which	is	best	typified	as	paranoia	.	.
s2092	The	aims	of	the	present	study	were	to	evaluate	the	relation	of	dysregulated	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	c	-	MET	,	and	NM23-H1	expression	with	the	histopathological	features	of	tumors	in	recurrence	formation	in	eCC	cases	.	.
s1827	Therefore	,	our	findings	demonstrate	that	anatomical_structure_morphogenesis-/-	rabbits	can	be	used	as	a	model	for	human	ECTD-9	,	especially	to	understand	the	pathologic	mechanism	of	hypotrichosis	.	.
s321	Adipose	expression	of	protein_secretion_was	markedly	upregulated	in	obese	and	diabetic	humans	and	in	genetic	and	dietary	models	of	obesity_in	rodents	.	.
s3348	Mutations	in	the	human	tRNA_3'-terminal_CCA_addition_gene	encoding	tRNA	nucleotidyltransferase	(	tRNA	-	NT	)	,	an	essential	enzyme	responsible	for	addition	of	the	CCA	(	cytidine	-	cytidine	-	adenosine	)	sequence	to	the	3	-termini	of	tRNAs	,	have	been	linked	to	disease	phenotypes	including	congenital	sideroblastic	anemia	with	B	-	cell	immunodeficiency	,	periodic	fevers	and	developmental	delay	(	SIFD	)	or	retinitis	pigmentosa	with	erythrocyte	microcytosis	.	.
