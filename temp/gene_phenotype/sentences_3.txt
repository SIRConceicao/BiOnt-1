s1374	This	study	reports	first	case	of	variants	in	the	genes	causing	endochondral_bone_growth_syndrome	and	profound	deafness_in	the	same	family	.
s1889	Therefore	,	we	propose	that	MRE11	inhibition	might	be	an	effective	strategy	to	treat	positive_regulation_of_gene_expression	-	amplified	and	p53	wild	-	type	neuroblastoma	,	and	suggest	that	targeting	replication	stress	with	appropriate	tools	should	be	further	exploited	to	tackle	MYCN	-	driven	tumors	.
s415	We	asked	whether	ROM1	could	modify	the	phenotype	of	a	cell_surface_receptor_signaling_pathway_mutation	associated	with	a	high	degree	of	intrafamilial	phenotypic	heterogeneity	,	Y141C.	.
s3352	These	findings	document	shared	genetic	networks	between	spina_bifida_risk	and	bone	structure	,	including	negative_regulation_of_systemic_arterial_blood_pressure_components	and	Zic2	.	.
s791	This	is	consistent	with	previous	studies	reporting	arthrogryposis_in	regulation_of_myelination	-	deficient	mice	due	to	peripheral	hypomyelination	.	.
s890	16q24	deletion	involving	the	odontogenesis_of_dentin	-	containing_tooth_gene	,	ranging	from	137	kb	to	2	Mb	,	have	been	associated	with	a	microdeletion	syndrome	characterized	by	variable	cognitive	impairment	,	autism	spectrum	disorder	,	facial	dysmorphisms	with	dental	anomalies	,	brain	abnormalities	essentially	affecting	the	corpus	callosum	and	short_stature	.	.
s184	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal_recessive_Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy	(	SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	antigen_receptor	-	mediated_signaling_pathway	/	ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s709	We	report	a	sibling	pair	with	FTHS	caused	by	a	homozygous	,	novel	mutation	pLys133Glnfs	13	in	the	superoxide_metabolic_process_gene	,	one	sibling	had	bilateral	ocular	hypertension	and	unilateral	colobomas	of	iris	,	choroid	and	retina	,	the	other	,	unilateral	myelinated	nerve	fiber	layer	of	the	optic	disk	and	papilledema_due	to	idiopathic	intracranial	hypertension	.	.
s1037	negative_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_is	a	critical	AKT	target	in	DLC1-positive	cancer	because	AKT	inhibition	has	potent	antitumor_activity	in	the	DLC1-positive	transgenic	cancer	model	and	in	a	DLC1-positive	cancer	cell	line	but	not	in	an	isogenic	DLC1-negative	cell	line	.
s3784	In	this	study	,	we	employed	a	siRNA	knockdown	approach	for	heparan	sulphate	(	EXT1	)	and	heparan	/	chondroitin	/	dermatan	sulphate	-	biosynthetic	enzymes	(	b4GalT7	)	in	the	aggressive	human	breast	cancer_cell	line	MDA	-	MB-231	to	study	the	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_on	cell	behaviour	and	hyaluronan	biosynthesis	.	.
s3440	The	CSIRO	National	MAPK_cascade_Telehealth	Trial	investigated	the	effects	of	introducing	at	home	telemonitoring	of	vital	signs	for	the	management	of	a	heterogeneous_group	of	chronically	ill	patients	.	.
s965	Whole	-	exome	or	targeted	exome	sequencing	of	183	unrelated	familial	and/or	severe	CAKUT	-	affected	case	subjects	,	including	54	fetuses	with	BKA	,	led	to	the	identification	of	16	heterozygous	variants	in	kidney_development_(growth	regulation	by	estrogen	in	breast	cancer_1-like	)	,	a	gene	reported	as	a	target	of	retinoic	acid	signaling	.	.
s147	Three	patients	presented	with	cognitive	impairment	,	reinforcing	the	association	between	the	disrupted	genes	(	TSPAN7-cell_surface_receptor_signaling_pathway	,	KIAA2022-MRX98	,	and	IL1RAPL1-MRX21/34	)	and	intellectual_disability	.	.
s1214	The	MKK1/2	kinase	tumour_progression	locus	2	(	TPL-2	)	is	critical	for	the	production	of	tumour	necrosis	factor	alpha	(	protein_import_into_nucleus,_translocationa	)	in	innate	immune	responses	and	a	potential	anti	-	inflammatory	drug	target	.	.
s2463	Here	,	we	applied	domain	-	focused	CRISPR	screening	to	human	cancer_cell	lines	to	identify	the	transcription	factor	(	TF	)	negative_regulation_by_host_of_viral_transcription_(POU	class	2	homeobox	3	,	also	known	as	SKN-1a	/	OCT-11	)	as	a	powerful	dependency	in	a	subset	of	SCLC	lines	.	.
s1358	Our	findings	suggest	that	the	rRNA_processing_gene	may	likely	be	a	sensitive	factor	in	female	patients	with	schizophrenia	,	and	that	modification	of	the	WDR3	signaling	pathway	warrants	further	investigation	as	to	the	pathophysiology	of	schizophrenia	.
s756	To	understand	the	characteristics	of	AMP_biosynthetic_process_myopathy	,	we	investigated	the	clinical	manifestation	in	Korean	patients	with	ADSSL1	mutations	.	.
s1015	Over	the	last	5	years	,	several	single	gene	disorders	of	the	autophagy	pathway	have	emerged	,	EPG5-associated	Vici	syndrome	,	WDR45-associated	b	-	propeller	protein	-	associated	neurodegeneration	,	autophagosome_maturation	-	associated	autosomal	-	recessive	spinocerebellar	ataxia_20	,	ATG5-associated	autosomal	-	recessive	ataxia	syndrome	,	SQSTM1/p62-associated	childhood	-	onset	neurodegeneration	,	and	several	forms	of	the	hereditary	spastic	paraplegias	.	.
s3956	These	results	provide	new	insights	on	the	biological	relevance	of	the	regulation_of_cell_growth_pathway	in	breast	cancer_progression	and	underscore	the	need	for	more	genetic	epidemiology	studies	of	breast	cancer	in	the	African	Diaspora	.
s3305	Consequently	,	hallmarks	of	cancer_invasion	and	metastasis	related	to	regulation_of_modification_of_postsynaptic_actin_cytoskeleton	,	actin	cytoskeleton	,	and/or	force	transmission	,	such	as	migration	,	extracellular	matrix	degradation	,	and	Serpin	B2	secretion	,	were	reduced	in	cells	lacking	Piezo2	.
s1382	The	contiguous	deletion	of	NDP	and	its	neighbouring	genes	,	cellular_biogenic_amine_metabolic_process	/	B	and	EFHC2	,	reportedly	leads	to	syndromic	clinical	features	such	as	microcephaly	,	intellectual	disability	,	and	epilepsy	.	.
s3288	negative_regulation_of_kinase_activity	,	also	known	as	p57kip2	,	is	considered	to	be	a	potential	tumor_suppressor	implicated	in	several	kinds	of	human	cancers	.	.
s511	The	up	-	regulation	of	ALL1-fused	gene	from	chromosome	1q	(	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	)	is	commonly	seen	in	aggressive	hematologic	malignancies	as	well	as	in	several	solid	tumor_tissues	.	.
s2603	Oral	cancer_was	associated	with	two	new	regions	,	2p23.3	(	rs6547741	,	biological_process	)	and	9q34.12	(	rs928674	,	LAMC3	)	,	and	with	known	cancer	-	related	loci-9p21.3	(	rs8181047	,	CDKN2B	-	AS1	)	and	5p15.33	(	rs10462706	,	CLPTM1L	)	.	.
s58	The	created	databases	include	ACAD8	(	isobutyryl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	deficiency	(	IBD	)	)	,	ACADSB	(	short	-	chain	acyl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	(	SCAD	)	deficiency	)	,	AUH	(	3-methylglutaconic	aciduria	(	3-MGCA	)	)	,	cholesterol_biosynthetic_process_(Smith	-	Lemli	-	Opitz	syndrome	)	,	HMGCS2	(	3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl	-	CoA	synthase	2	deficiency	)	,	HSD17B10	(	17-beta	-	hydroxysteroid	dehydrogenase	X	deficiency	)	,	FKBP14	(	Ehlers	-	Danlos	syndrome	with	progressive	kyphoscoliosis	,	myopathy	,	and	hearing	loss	,	EDSKMH	)	and	ROGDI	(	Kohlschutter	-	Tonz	syndrome	)	.	.
s238	Retinitis	pigmentosa	(	biological_process	)	describes	a	group	of	inherited	retinopathies	that	are	characterized	by	the	progressive	degeneration	of	photoreceptor	neurons	,	which	causes	night	blindness	,	a	reduction	in	the	peripheral	visual	field	and	decreased	visual	acuity	.	.
s180	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal_recessive_Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	purine_ribonucleotide_catabolic_process_and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy	(	SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s2333	Furthermore	,	pyruvate_metabolic_process	-	M	silencing	abrogated	cancer_growth	in	a	lung	cancer	cell	xenograft	model	.	.
s3878	Cerebral	,	ocular	,	dental	,	auricular	,	skeletal	(	CODAS	)	syndrome	is	a	rare	autosomal_recessive_multisystem	disorder	caused	by	mutations	in	cellular_response_to_oxidative_stress	.	.
s3108	negative_regulation_of_epithelial_cell_migration	,	a	transmembrane	glycoprotein	,	has	emerged	as	a	biomarker	for	targeted	cancer_therapy	since	it	is	overexpressed	in	80	%	of	triple	negative	breast	cancer	(	TNBC	)	patients	.	.
s3649	The	aim	of	the	present	study	was	to	investigate	the	effect	of	cerebral_cortex_development_on	chemotherapy	resistance	of	gastric	cancer_(GC	)	and	to	research	the	mechanisms	of	Ginkgo	biloba	extract	761	(	EGb	761R	)	on	reversing	chemoresistence	which	has	been	confirmed	in	our	previous	study	.	.
s1831	Moreover	,	positive_regulation_of_stress	-	activated_MAPK_cascade	-	dependent	functions	have	recently	been	indicated	to	modulate	the	development	of	autoimmunity	,	inflammatory	bowel	diseases	,	and	cancer	.	.
s1420	Our	study	identifies	urine	D2HG	and	tissue	response_to_manganese_ion_expression	as	biomarkers	to	identify	patients	at	risk	for	progressing	from	colitis	to	cancer	.	.
s1056	We	review	the	literature	of	genetic	PD	autopsies	from	cases	with	molecularly	confirmed	PD	or	parkinsonism_and	summarize	main	findings	on	SNCA	(	n	=	25	)	,	Parkin	(	n	=	20	,	17	bi	-	allelic	and	3	heterozygotes	)	,	PINK1	(	n	=	5	,	1	bi	-	allelic	and	4	heterozygotes	)	,	DJ-1	(	n	=	1	)	,	LRRK2	(	n	=	55	)	,	GBA	(	n	=	10	Gaucher	disease	patients	with	parkinsonism	)	,	DNAJC13	,	tetrahydrobiopterin_biosynthetic_process	,	ATP13A2	,	PLA2G6	(	n	=	8	patients	,	2	with	PD	)	,	MPAN	(	n	=	2	)	,	FBXO7	,	RAB39B	,	and	ATXN2	(	SCA2	)	,	as	well	as	on	22q	deletion	syndrome	(	n	=	3	)	.	.
s679	Alterations	of	von	Hippel	-	Lindau	(	VHL	)	,	succinate	dehydrogenase	(	SDHX	)	,	and	TMEM127	have	been	associated	with	the	development	of	pheochromocytomas	(	positive_regulation_of_cell_migrations	)	and	paragangliomas_(PGLs	)	and	are	also	associated	with	the	development	of	renal	neoplasms	.	.
s3696	In	negative_regulation_of_peptidase_activity	-	positive	tumor_samples	,	CSTA	-	expressing	cancer	cells	often	expressed	Ki67	,	a	proliferation	marker	,	which	was	in	sharp	contrast	to	normal	mucosa	,	where	Ki67-expressing	cells	were	limited	to	the	basal	layer	and	did	not	express	CSTA	.	.
s557	Recent	GWAS	completed	for	three	types	of	common	adult	-	onset	glaucoma_have	identified	novel	loci	for	POAG	(	primary	-	open	-	angle	glaucoma	)	(	ABCA1	,	AFAP1	,	GMDS	,	PMM2	,	TGFBR3	,	FNDC3B	,	ARHGEF12	,	GAS7	,	FOXC1	,	negative_regulation_of_receptor_internalization	,	TXNRD2	)	,	PACG	(	primary	angle	-	closure	glaucoma	(	EPDR1	,	CHAT	,	GLIS3	,	FERMT2	,	DPM2-FAM102	)	,	and	exfoliation	syndrome	(	XFS	)	glaucoma	(	CACNA1A	)	.	.
s3257	In	renal_cell_carcinoma_(RCC	)	,	expression	of	microRNA-451a	(	protein_polyubiquitination-451a	)	was	significantly	downregulated	in	patient	specimens	and	low	expression	of	miR-451a	was	significantly	associated	with	poor	prognosis	of	RCC	patients	(	P	=	.00305	)	based	on	data	in	The	Cancer	Genome	Atlas	.	.
s3397	protein_polyubiquitination-23b-3p	expression	was	pronouncedly	decreased	in	HCC	tissues	in	contrast	with	their	paired	adjacent	non	-	cancerous	HCC	(	PAAAA0.001	)	with	RT	-	qPCR	.	.
s1956	Drosophila	mutants	that	were	null	for	an	orthologue	of	mitotic_cytokinesis_were	sterile	,	and	gonadal_dysgenesis_was	present	in	both	sexes	.	.
s3529	In	recent	years	,	many	studies	have	shown	that	Smac	/	intrinsic_apoptotic_signaling_pathway_in_response_to_oxidative_stress_is	closely	related	to	tumor_drug	resistance	.	.
s3589	Furthermore	,	in	cultured	human	BMSCs	,	TGF	-	a	stimulated	production	of	procancer_cytokines	including	IL-6	,	VEGF	,	FGF10	,	FGF17	,	and	TGF	-	protein_localization_to_cilium_in	a	dose	-	dependent	manner	.	.
s2247	In	this	study	we	extend	these	findings	by	demonstrating	that	the	mRNA	levels	of	RBCK1	and	regulation_of_tumor_necrosis_factor	-	mediated_signaling_pathway_are	also	higher	in	tumors	compared	to	adjacent	non	-	tumor	tissue	in	the	same	cross	sectional	study	of	samples	(	p	AAAA	0.001	)	.	.
s2775	Interestingly	,	the	naturally	occurring	microcephaly	-	associated	mutant	,	centriole_replication_(A578P	)	,	shows	a	low	affinity	for	STIL	binding	and	blocks	centriole	assembly	.	.
s1927	Transcriptomic	analysis	revealed	significant	alterations	in	a	number	of	genes	associated	with	autism	,	such	as	adsl	,	mbd5	,	learning	,	and	tsc1b	.	.
s2204	Taken	together	,	these	results	suggested	that	USP18	may	serve	a	key	role	in	breast	cancer_development	by	upregulating	EGFR	and	subsequently	activating	the	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	/	Skp2	feedback	loop	pathway	.	.
s3737	Other	rRNA_processing_mutations	and	EXOSC8	cases	are	intermediate	;	SMA	type	1-like	presentation	,	spasticity_(mostly	in	EXOSC8	)	and	death	between	3	months	and	5	years	.	.
s3763	Our	data	provide	in	vivo	evidence	that	cellular_protein_metabolic_process_mutation	leads	to	L-2-HG	accumulation	,	leukoencephalopathy	,	and	neurodegeneration	in	mice	,	thereby	offering	new	insights	into	the	pathophysiology	of	L-2-HGA	in	humans	.
s3944	That	binding	,	which	interferes	with	the	interaction	of	RhoA	-	GTP	with	the	G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathwayGAP	domain	,	reduces	the	hydrolysis	of	RhoA	-	GTP	,	the	binding	of	other	DLC1	ligands	,	and	the	colocalization	of	DLC1	with	focal	adhesions	and	attenuates	tumor_suppressor	activity	.	.
s506	This	included	identification	of	,	complex	ocular	phenotypes	due	to	two	novel	PAX6	mutations	,	progressive	cortical	cataract_and	lamellar	cataract	with	lens	subluxation	due	to	two	novel	morphogenesis_of_an_epithelium_mutations	.	.
s3703	peptidyl	-	threonine_dephosphorylation_is	a	metal	-	dependent	serine	/	threonine	protein	phosphatase	,	with	a	similar	structure	and	function	to	the	well	-	known	oncogene	in	breast	cancer	,	PPM1D	(	WIP1	)	.	.
s2361	Western	blot	was	used	to	analyze	the	cell	cycle	-	related	proteins	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	ataxia_telangiectasia	mutant	(	ATM	)	,	ataxia	telangiectasia	and	Rad3-related	protein	(	actin_cytoskeleton_reorganization	)	and	cyclin	B1	(	CCNB1	)	.	.
s3211	From	the	integrative	analysis	of	the	transcriptome	and	clinicopathologic	data	of	human	multi	-	stage	HCC	tissues	,	we	were	able	to	identify	barrier	-	to	-	autointegration	factor	1	(	negative_regulation_of_viral_genome_replication	)	,	procollagen	-	lysine	,	2-oxoglutarate	5-dioxygenase	3	(	PLOD3	)	and	splicing	factor	3b	subunit	4	(	SF3B4	)	as	early	HCC	biomarkers	which	could	be	detected	in	precancerous	lesions	of	HCC	,	with	superior	capabilities	to	diagnose	eHCC	compared	to	the	currently	popular	HCC	diagnostic	biomarkers	,	GPC3	,	GS	,	and	HSP70	.	.
s1648	Using	whole	-	exome	sequencing	,	we	identified	seven	unrelated	individuals	with	global	developmental	delay	,	hypotonia	,	dysmorphic	facial	features	,	and	an	increased	frequency	of	short	stature	,	ataxia	,	and	autism	with	de	novo	heterozygous	frameshift	,	nonsense	,	splice	,	and	missense	variants	in	the	Early	B	-	cell	Transcription	Factor	Family	Member	3	(	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	)	gene	.	.
s2675	Hemangioblastomas	(	HBs	)	are	uncommon	tumors	characterized	by	the	presence	of	inactivating	alterations	in	the	von	Hippel	-	Lindau	(	protein_ubiquitination	)	gene	in	inherited	cases	and	by	infrequent	somatic	mutation	in	sporadic_entities	.	.
s778	In	human	breast	cancer_xenografts	in	humanized	mice	,	blocking	the	recruitment	of	naive	CD4	+	T	cells	into	tumor	by	knocking	down	the	expression	of	PITPNM3	,	a	monocyte_chemotaxis_receptor	,	significantly	reduces	intratumoral	Tregs	and	inhibits	tumor	progression	.	.
s1634	Five	individuals	who	carry	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_nonsense	variants	resulting	in	a	premature	stop	codon	display	severe	neurodevelopmental	regression	,	hypotonia	,	progressive_ataxia	,	seizures	,	and	a	lack	of	coordination	.	.
s2035	In	short	,	the	current	study	suggests	XIST	plays	as	an	important	role	in	colon	cancer_progression	targeted	by	protein_polyubiquitination-34a	via	Wnt	/	b	-	catenin	signaling	pathway	,	providing	a	novel	insight	for	the	pathogenesis	and	underlying	therapeutic	target	for	colon	cancer	.
s1686	During	drug	discovery	efforts	targeting	inhibition	of	cytochrome	P450	11B2	(	C21-steroid_hormone_biosynthetic_process)-mediated	production	of	aldosterone	as	a	therapeutic	approach	for	the	treatment	of	chronic	kidney	disease	and	hypertension	,	(	S)-6-(5-fluoro-4-(1-hydroxyethyl)pyridin-3-yl)-3,4-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridine-1(2H)-carboxamide	(	1	)	was	identified	as	a	potent	and	selective	inhibitor	of	CYP11B2	.	.
s2257	The	volumes	of	the	tumors	were	similar	between	those	injected	with	the	empty	vector	and	control	,	but	were	significantly	smaller	in	the	knockdown	models	,	suggesting	that	the	knockdown	of	the	DNA_replication	-	dependent_nucleosome_assembly_gene	inhibited	tumor	growth	.	.
s391	Our	exome	analysis	indicated	the	proband	as	a	compound	heterozygote	for	two	missense	variants	in	the	autophagy_gene	according	to	a	recessive	mode_of_inheritance	.	.
s2902	The	present	study	also	identified	in	tumor	and	potentially	malignant	lesions	common	alterations	of	chromosomal	regions	and	genes	,	including	FBXL5	,	UGT2B15	,	steroid_metabolic_process	,	KANSL1	,	GSTT1	and	DUSP22	,	being	some	of	these	typical	aberrations	described	in	oral	cancer_and	others	are	linked	to	chemoradioresistance	.	.
s1562	Pain	was	significantly	higher	in	LZTR1-mutant	than	in	nucleosome_disassembly	-	mutant	patients	,	though	spinal	tumor_location	did	not	significantly	correlate	with	pain	.	.
s2041	Patients	with	heritable	cancer	syndromes	characterized	by	germline	negative_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_mutations	(	termed	PTEN	hamartoma	tumor_syndrome	,	PHTS	)	benefit	from	PTEN	-	enabled	cancer	risk	assessment	and	clinical	management	.	.
s667	Bardet	-	Biedl	syndrome	(	visual_perception	)	is	a	genetically	heterogeneous_disorder	characterized	by	retinal	dystrophy	,	polydactyly	,	obesity	,	developmental	delay	,	and	renal	defects	.	.
s348	In	the	remaining	cases	,	next	generation	sequencing	was	carried	out	revealing	variants	in	a	number	of	other	known	complex	spastic	paraplegia	genes	,	including	five	in	SPG7	(	5/97	)	,	four	in	FA2H	(	also	known	as	SPG35	)	(	4/97	)	and	two	in	ZFYVE26/SPG15	Variants	were	identified	in	genes	usually	associated	with	pure	spastic	paraplegia	and	also	in	the	Parkinson	s	disease	-	associated	gene	ATP13A2	,	neuronal	ceroid	lipofuscinosis	gene	TPP1	and	the	hereditary	motor	and	sensory	neuropathy_maintenance_of_DNA_methylation_gene	,	highlighting	the	genetic	heterogeneity	of	spastic	paraplegia	.	.
s972	microRNAs	have	been	reported	to	play	vital	role	in	lung	cancer	proliferation	and	metastasis	,	the	role	of	protein_polyubiquitination-4326	in	tumor_progression	has	not	been	studied	.	.
s1806	The	present	study	focuses	on	replicating	the	analyses	completed	by	Ji	et	al	to	identify	effects	of	rare	variants	in	the	population	-	based	Atherosclerosis	Risk	in	Communities	(	ARIC	)	study	.	We	attempted	to	replicate	the	findings	by	Ji	et	al	by	applying	their	criteria	to	identify	putative	loss	-	of	-	function	variants	with	allele	frequency	AAAA0.001	and	complete	conservation	across	a	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_of	orthologs	,	to	exome	sequencing	data	from	7444	European	ancestry	participants	of	the	ARIC	study	.	Although	we	failed	to	replicate	the	previous	findings	when	applying	their	methods	to	the	ARIC	study	data	,	we	observed	a	similar	effect	when	we	restricted	analyses	to	the	subset	of	variants	they	observed	.	These	results	simultaneously	support	the	utility	of	exome	sequencing	data	for	studying	extremely	rare	coding	variants	in	hypertension_and	underscore	the	need	for	improved	filtering	methods	for	identifying	functional	variants	in	human	sequences	.
s3960	We	also	analyzed	specific	mutations	within	the	12	genes	and	found	that	some	specific	mutations	within	the	MUC12	,	FOXD4L3	and	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_genes	showed	higher	frequencies	in	the	samples	of	FLC	and/or	lung	cancer_tissue	,	compared	with	the	healthy	population	.	.
s4071	The	variants	gap_junction_assembly_c.235delC	,	SLC26A4	c.919	-	2AAAAAG	,	and	mitochondrial_variants	m.1555AAAAAG	and	m.1494CAAAAT	were	assayed	using	real	time	PCR	.	.
s1904	Stimulation	of	BxPC-3	,	Panc-1	,	and	MIA	PaCA-2	pancreatic	cancer_cells	with	angiogenesis	,	HGF	,	FGF-1	,	FGF-2	,	FGF-7	,	and	FGF-10	growth	factors	caused	changes	in	the	expression	of	master	genes	regulating	pancreatic	development	(	SOX9	,	HNF3b	,	GATA-4	,	GATA-6	,	and	HES1	)	.	.
s1240	Our	results	indicated	that	ubiquitin	-	dependent_protein_catabolic_process_rs9404576	polymorphism	may	be	associated	with	Wilms	_	tumor_susceptibility	in	the	Chinese	population	.
s3133	Mutations	in	MYH3	and	skeletal_muscle_contraction_are	associated	with	distal	arthrogryposis_syndromes	.	.
s880	The	glycogen_metabolic_process_and	RNF40	genes	are	either	overlapping	or	close	to	the	sequences	of	SCAR	marker	BC13	-	4	,	while	SCAR	marker	BC10	-	1	is	in	the	intron	and	overlap	the	DPEP1	gene	,	suggesting	that	alterations	in	the	expression	of	these	genes	could	contribute	to	cancer_progression	.	.
s3174	Interaction	study	showed	the	association	between	peptide_hormone_processing_polymorphisms	and	hypertension_could	be	changed	by	overweight	(	BMI	G	25	kg	/	m2	)	.	.
s1656	Immunostaining	showed	that	the	colon	cancer_was	positive	for	CDX2	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	had	a	loss	of	PMS2	and	intact	expression	of	MLH1	,	MSH2	and	MSH6	,	negative	for	AMACR	,	while	the	prostate	cancer	was	positive	for	AMACR	,	had	intact	expression	of	PMS2	,	MLH1	,	MSH2	and	MSH6	,	and	negative	for	CDX2	and	SATB2	.	.
s1547	Hepatic	positive_regulation_of_telomere_maintenance_via_telomerase_overexpression	also	activated	the	CaM	/	Akt	pathway	and	repressed	the	mTOR	/	SREBP-1C	pathway	to	ameliorate	hyperglycemia_and	steatosis	in	obese	mice	.	.
s381	They	present	with	global	negative_regulation_of_autophagy	,	and	one	individual	developed	a	hematological	cancer_(acute	myeloid	leukemia	)	in	childhood	.	.
s2815	Mutations	in	the	kinesin	family	member	1A	(	anterograde_neuronal_dense_core_vesicle_transport	)	gene	have	been	associated	with	a	wide	range	of	phenotypes	including	recessive	mutations	causing	hereditary	sensory	neuropathy_and	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	and	de	novo	dominant	mutations	causing	a	more	complex	neurological	disorder	affecting	both	the	central	and	peripheral	nervous	system	.	.
s3519	Here	,	we	are	elucidating	the	mechanism	of	a	heritable	positive_regulation_of_telomere_maintenance_via_telomerase_subunit	mutation	that	causes	profound_neuropathy	in	humans	.	.
s1618	With	the	notable	exception	of	canonical_Wnt_signaling_pathway_(Tooth	agenesis	,	selective	,	4	,	MIM	#	150400	)	,	the	genotype	-	phenotype	relationships	described	in	the	present	cohort	represent	an	expansion	of	the	clinical	spectrum	associated	with	these	genes	,	TSPEAR	(	Deafness	,	autosomal_recessive_98	,	MIM	#	614861	)	,	LAMB3	(	Amelogenesis	imperfecta	,	type	IA	,	MIM	#	104530	,	Epidermolysis	bullosa	,	junctional	,	MIMs	#	226700	and	#	226650	)	,	and	BCOR	(	Microphthalmia	,	syndromic	2	,	MIM	#	300166	)	.	.
s1034	The	increased	RhoA	-	GTP	results	from	AKT	phosphorylating	three	serines	(	S298	,	S329	,	and	S567	)	in	the	DLC1	tumor_suppressor	,	a	G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway_GTPase	-	activating	protein	(	RhoGAP	)	associated	with	focal	adhesions	.	.
s2393	In	acute	leukemias	,	it	is	not	clear	whether	transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_alterations	contribute	to	the	development	of	the	malignant	clone	or	whether	they	are	simply	the	effect	of	tumor_expansion	on	the	microenvironment	.	.
s1639	Mutations	in	a	number	of	different	genes	causative	for	microcephaly_have	been	identified	,	e.g.	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	WDR62	,	and	ASPM	.	.
s3994	That	binding	,	which	interferes	with	the	interaction	of	RhoA	-	GTP	with	the	G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathwayGAP	domain	,	reduces	the	hydrolysis	of	RhoA	-	GTP	,	the	binding	of	other	DLC1	ligands	,	and	the	colocalization	of	DLC1	with	focal	adhesions	and	attenuates	tumor_suppressor	activity	.	.
s3985	To	gain	insight	into	the	molecular	basis	of	the	heterogeneous_phenotype	observed	in	men	with	the	deletion	we	defined	the	type	of	DAZ	and	spermatogenesis_genes	deleted	.	.
s1152	We	conclude	that	loss	of	oncogenic	miR-1274a	reduced	cancer_cell	proliferation	and	induced	apoptosis	in	ccRCC	through	targeting	protein_phosphorylation	.	.
s2979	Immunohistochemistry	analysis	showed	reduced	mRNA_splicing,_via_spliceosome_levels	in	tumors	which	were	supported	by	in	silico	analysis	data	.	.
s566	NGLY1	patients	produce	little	or	no	N	-	glycanase	(	glycoprotein_catabolic_process	)	,	and	the	symptoms	include	global	developmental_delay	,	frequent	seizures	,	complex	hyperkinetic	movement	disorder	,	difficulty	in	swallowing	/	aspiration	,	liver	dysfunction	,	and	a	lack	of	tears	.	.
s9	We	found	that	a	downregulation	of	rRNA	synthesis	,	induced	by	silencing	the	POLR1A	gene	coding	for	the	RNA	polymerase	I	catalytic	subunit	,	stabilised	DNA_strand_renaturation_without	altering	the	nucleolar	integrity	in	human	cancer_cells	.	.
s3384	Sherlock	integrative	analysis	shows	that	ALMS1	,	GLT8D1	,	and	positive_regulation_of_pathway	-	restricted_SMAD_protein_phosphorylation_are	schizophrenia_risk	genes	,	which	are	validated	using	independent	brain	expression	quantitative	trait	loci	(	eQTL	)	data	and	integrative	analysis	method	(	SMR	)	.	.
s1404	Furthermore	,	we	found	that	tumor_necrosis	factor	(	TNF	)	receptor	-	associated	factor	5	(	TRAF5	)	and	TGF	-	b	activated	kinase	1	(	activation_of_MAPKK_activity	)	binding	protein	1	(	TAB1	)	were	direct	targets	of	miR-873	in	CRC	cells	.	.
s2138	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	inner_dynein_arm_assembly	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s407	We	describe	an	autosomal	dominant	inherited	pedigree	with	sarcomere_organization	-	MFM	that	is	in	line	with	the	typical	phenotype	of	distal	myopathy	without	cardiomyopathy_and	neuropathy	,	while	mild	asymmetrical	muscle	atrophy	can	be	observed	in	some	affected	members	.	.
s1649	Using	whole	-	exome	sequencing	,	we	identified	seven	unrelated	individuals	with	global	developmental	delay	,	hypotonia	,	dysmorphic	facial	features	,	and	an	increased	frequency	of	short	stature	,	ataxia	,	and	autism_with	de	novo	heterozygous	frameshift	,	nonsense	,	splice	,	and	missense	variants	in	the	Early	B	-	cell	Transcription	Factor	Family	Member	3	(	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	)	gene	.	.
s3774	The	human	tongue	cancer_cell	line	CAL27	was	used	to	study	the	effects	of	establishment_of_epithelial_cell_polarity	.	.
s1137	Using	this	gene	panel	,	we	were	able	to	identify	disease	-	causing	variants	in	17	out	of	87	(	19.5	%	)	analyzed	patients	,	all	found	in	known	epilepsy	-	associated	genes	(	KCNQ2	,	CDKL5	,	STXBP1	,	cardiac_muscle_cell_action_potential_involved_in_contraction	,	PCDH19	,	POLG	,	SLC2A1	,	ARX	,	ALG13	,	CHD2	,	SYNGAP1	,	and	GRIN1	)	.	.
s839	Therefore	,	we	concluded	that	AHI1	c.3257AAAAAG	and	muscle_fiber_development_c.914	AAAAAG	were	potential	causal	variants	in	this	strabismus_pedigree	.	.
s3210	Overexpression	of	Nanos3	induces	epithelial	-	mesenchymal	transition	in	lung	cancer_cell	lines	partly	by	repressing	E	-	integrin	-	mediated_signaling_pathway	.	.
s2443	We	demonstrated	that	linc	-	ADAL	interacts	with	heterogeneous_nuclear	ribonucleoprotein	U	(	regulation_of_alternative_mRNA_splicing,_via_spliceosome	)	and	insulin	-	like	growth	factor	2	mRNA	binding	protein	2	(	IGF2BP2	)	at	distinct	subcellular	locations	to	regulate	adipocyte	differentiation	and	lipogenesis	.
s2580	We	found	no	correlation	between	the	negative_regulation_of_cell_proliferation	,	TUSC4	and	MLH1	gene	expression	and	NSCLC	patient	characteristics	(	gender	,	age	and	smoking	)	or	cancer_histopathology	.	.
s2359	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_might	be	a	new	drug	resistance	related	gene	in	pancreatic	cancer_cells	by	up	-	regulation	of	MRP2	expression	.
s45	The	protein_targeting	-	associated	phenotype	has	previously	been	assigned	to	spastic_paraplegia-47	.	.
s3272	Furthermore	,	silencing	mitotic_spindle_organization_inhibited	cell	proliferation	and	induced	apoptosis	in	lung_adenocarcinoma(LUAD	)	cells	.	.
s3803	We	used	a	genotypic	ascertainment	study	design	to	test	the	association	of	sensory_perception_of_sound_variants	with	hearing_loss	.	.
s3973	Furthermore	,	we	found	increased	concentration	of	cytochrome	c	,	intrinsic_apoptotic_signaling_pathway_in_response_to_oxidative_stress	/	Diablo	and	increased	caspase-3	and	caspase-9	activity	,	cleavage	of	PARP	as	well	as	activation	of	DNA	repair	mechanisms	in	1C	-	treated	HCT116	cancer_cells	.	.
s1036	That	binding	,	which	interferes	with	the	interaction	of	RhoA	-	GTP	with	the	RhoGAP	domain	,	reduces	the	hydrolysis	of	RhoA	-	GTP	,	the	binding	of	other	negative_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_ligands	,	and	the	colocalization	of	DLC1	with	focal	adhesions	and	attenuates	tumor_suppressor	activity	.	.
s3978	In	addition	,	regulation_of_phosphate_transport_suppresses	proximal_tubular	expression	of	1a	-	hydroxylase	,	the	key	enzyme	responsible	for	vitamin	D	hormone	production	.	.
s2184	In	the	current	study	,	we	found	that	the	expresmelanosome_organizationon	of	Cx31	in	thyroid	cancer_tissues	and	thyroid	cancer	cell	lines	was	significantly	lower	than	that	in	normal	thyroid	epithelial	tissues	and	cell	lines	.	.
s2356	Conclusions	,	Two	stable	multidrug	resistant	cell	lines	of	pancreatic	cancer	,	JF305/CDDP	and	PANC-1/negative_regulation_of_DNA_replication	,	were	successfully	established	.	.
s2009	Importantly	,	bone	cell	activity	was	inversely	correlated	to	tumor_cell	AR	activity	(	measured	as	AR	,	FOXA1	,	HOXB13	,	KLK2	,	KLK3	,	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	,	STEAP2	,	and	TMPRSS2	expression	)	and	to	patient	serum	prostate	-	specific	antigen	(	PSA	)	levels	.	.
s3243	Logistic	regression	analysis	adjusted	for	age	and	gender	reported	a	moderate	association	between	rectal	cancer_risk	and	two	negative_regulation_of_NF	-	kappaB_transcription_factor_activity_SNPs	,	rs1684575	TAAAAG	(	OR	,	1.60	,	95	%	CI	,	1.13	-	2.27	,	recessive	model	)	and	rs3751710	(	OR	,	0.70	,	95	%	CI	,	0.51	-	0.96	,	dominant	model	)	.	.
s3287	In	conclusion	,	fat_cell_differentiation_is	closely	associated	with	migration	,	proliferation	,	and	apoptosis	of	glioma_cells	,	and	might	be	considered	as	a	novel	prognostic	indicator	in	patients	with	gliomas	.
s1400	MicroRNA-873	(	protein_polyubiquitination-873	)	has	been	reported	to	be	dysregulated	in	a	variety	of	malignancies	,	however	,	the	biological	function	and	underlying	molecular	mechanism	of	miR-873	in	colorectal	cancer_(CRC	)	remain	unclear	.	.
s895	By	comparing	the	clinical	and	genetic	features	of	our	patients	with	those	previously	reported	,	we	show	that	the	severity	of	the	neurological	phenotype	and	the	frequency	of	congenital_heart_defects_characterize	the	deletions	that	,	besides	ANKRD11	,	contain	ZFPM1	,	cell_morphogenesis_and	ZNF778	as	well	.	.
s777	In	human	breast	cancer	xenografts	in	humanized	mice	,	blocking	the	recruitment	of	naive	CD4	+	T	cells	into	tumor_by	knocking	down	the	expression	of	ER_to_Golgi_vesicle	-	mediated_transport	,	a	CCL18	receptor	,	significantly	reduces	intratumoral	Tregs	and	inhibits	tumor	progression	.	.
s2768	negative_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_expression	detected	by	QPCR	,	immunoblots	and	immunofluorescent	stain	,	was	significantly	decreased	in	mouse	corneas	subjected	to	alkali	burn	-	induced	corneal_neovascularization_(CNV	)	.	.
s1179	positive_regulation_of_vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_production_and	LYVE1	expression	was	assessed	in	samples	from	normal	and	tumor_tissue	using	polymerase	chain	reaction	,	western	blot	analysis	and	immunohistochemistry	.	.
s1710	Sickle	cell	disease	(	quaternary_ammonium_group_transport	)	is	one	of	the	most	common	autosomal_recessive_diseases	in	humans	,	occurring	at	a	frequency	of	1	in	365	African	-	American	and	1	in	50	sub	-	Saharan	African	births	.	.
s619	Mutations	in	three	subunits	(	cilium	-	dependent_cell_motility	,	DRC2/CCDC65	,	DRC4/GAS8	)	have	been	linked	to	defects	in	ciliary	motility	in	humans	and	lead	to	a	ciliopathy	known	as	primary	ciliary_dyskinesia_(PCD	)	.	.
s2118	Monoallelic	and	biallelic	deleterious	sequence	variants	in	transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_cause	aphakia	,	cataracts	,	sclerocornea	and	microphthalmia	in	humans	.	.
s2977	Therefore	,	we	decided	to	look	into	its	role	in	tumor_progression	,	tumor	angiogenesis	,	and	its	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_on	cellular	properties	.	.
s78	In	embryo_development_ending_in_birth_or_egg_hatchingrd6	eyes	,	a	significant	1.5-	to	2.0-fold	decrease	was	observed	among	transcripts	of	genes	linked	to	retinal_degeneration	,	including	those	involved	in	visual	cycle	(	Rpe65	,	Lrat	,	Rgr	)	,	phototransduction	(	Pde6a	,	Guca1b	,	Rgs9	)	,	and	photoreceptor	disc	morphogenesis	(	Rrelationip1	and	Fscn2	)	.	.
s3256	Recent	analyses	of	our	microRNA	(	protein_polyubiquitinationNA	)	expression	signatures	obtained	from	several	types	of	cancer_have	provided	novel	information	on	their	molecular	pathology	.	.
s2109	In	20/23	cases	,	MDRnegative_regulation_of_gene_expression_BSI	occurred	during	neutropenia	.	.
s646	Tumor	growth	in	xenografts	as	well	as	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_signaling	were	assessed	in	HCT116	cells	expressing	IL17RD	with	either	a	mutant	3	_	untranslated	region	(	UTR	)	or	wild	-	type	(	WT	)	3	UTR.Results	,	miR-31	,	miR-34a	,	miR-106b	,	and	miR-193a-3p	were	significantly	dysregulated	in	ulcerative	colitis	-	neoplasia_and	adjacent	tissue	.	.
s3748	In	our	patient	cohort	,	causative	variants	in	GJB2	,	USH2A	,	MYO15A	and	auditory_receptor_cell_stereocilium_organization	,	and	in	MYO6	were	the	leading	causes	for	autosomal_recessive_and	dominant	HI	,	respectively	.	.
s554	Recent	GWAS	completed	for	three	types	of	common	adult	-	onset	glaucoma_have	identified	novel	loci	for	POAG	(	primary	-	open	-	angle	glaucoma	)	(	ABCA1	,	AFAP1	,	GMDS	,	PMM2	,	TGFBR3	,	FNDC3B	,	G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway	,	GAS7	,	FOXC1	,	ATXN2	,	TXNRD2	)	,	PACG	(	primary	angle	-	closure	glaucoma	(	EPDR1	,	CHAT	,	GLIS3	,	FERMT2	,	DPM2-FAM102	)	,	and	exfoliation	syndrome	(	XFS	)	glaucoma	(	CACNA1A	)	.	.
s654	Two	of	these	genes	were	independently	mutated	in	more	than	one	family	with	similar	phenotypes	,	which	substantiates	their	link	to	human	disease	(	AKAP6	in	intellectual_disability_and	ubiquitin	-	dependent_protein_catabolic_process_in	early	dementia	)	.	.
s1807	Humans	deficient	in	neutrophil_mediated_immunity_activity	have	autosomal_recessive_primary	immune	deficiency	(	PID	)	.	.
s1796	We	found	that	the	human	colorectal	cancer_cell	line	,	HCT-116	,	displayed	reduced	expression	of	activation_of_MAPKK_activity	-	tr	,	and	reintroduction	of	Raf1-tr	sensitized	the	cells	to	bleomycin	-	induced	apoptosis	.	.
s1234	It	is	therefore	recommended	that	,	depending	on	local	resources	and	availability	,	at	least	some	degree	of	genetic	testing	should	be	offered	to	all	PHEO	/	tricarboxylic_acid_cycle_patients	,	including	those	with	clinically	sporadic_disease	.	.
s982	RT	-	PCR	analysis	showed	that	the	overall	transcriptional	activity	of	the	main	HS	biosynthesis	-	involved	genes	(	EXT1	,	EXT2	,	heparan_sulfate_proteoglycan_biosynthetic_process	,	NDST2	,	GLCE	,	HS2ST1	,	HS3ST1	,	HS3ST2	,	HS6ST1	,	HS6ST2	,	SULF1	,	SULF2	,	HPSE	)	was	decreased	by	1.5	-	2-fold	in	Grade	II	-	III	glioma_(p	AAAA	0.01	)	and	by	3-fold	in	Grade	IV	glioma	(	glioblastoma	multiforme	,	GBM	)	(	p	AAAA	0.05	)	,	as	compared	with	the	para	-	tumourous	tissue	.	.
s2388	We	report	here	that	activation_of_cysteine	-	type_endopeptidase_activity_involved_in_apoptotic_process	,	which	is	known	to	inhibit	primary	tumor_growth	by	suppressing	angiogenesis	,	can	promote	lymphatic	metastasis	through	facilitating	lymphangiogenesis	in	tumors	.	.
s3579	With	a	feature	selection	algorithm	,	we	selected	a	panel	of	five	urinary	biomarkers	(	FTL	,	Ferritin	light	chain	,	MAPK1IP1L	,	Mitogen	-	Activated	Protein	Kinase	1	Interacting	Protein	1	Like	,	cell	-	matrix_adhesion	,	Fibrinogen	Beta	Chain	,	RAB33B	,	RAB33B	,	Member	RAS	Oncogene	Family	,	RAB15	,	RAB15	,	Member	RAS	Oncogene	Family	)	and	established	a	combinatorial	model	that	can	correctly	classify	the	majority	of	lung	cancer_cases	both	in	the	training	set	(	n=46	)	and	the	test	sets	(	n=14	-	47	per	set	)	with	an	AUC	ranging	from	0.8747	to	0.9853	.	.
s1553	Peripheral	schwannomas_were	detected	in	3	LZTR1-mutant	(	60	%	)	and	10	nucleosome_disassembly	-	mutant	subjects	(	66.7	%	)	.	.
s1900	In	this	study	,	we	present	detailed	clinical	information	of	16	novel	individuals	with	biallelic	sodium_ion_transmembrane_transport_variants	,	1	individual	with	a	heterozygous	de	novo	NALCN	missense	variant	and	an	interesting	clinical	phenotype	without	contractures	,	and	12	individuals	with	biallelic	UNC80	variants	.	.
s1257	Gene	mutations	in	the	IGF1	and	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_genes	have	been	described	in	patients	presenting	intrauterine	growth	retardation	and	postnatal	short_stature	.	.
s2853	icosanoid_metabolic_process_mutations	result	in	Ghosal	hematodiaphyseal	dysplasia	(	OMIM	231095	)	,	the	autosomal_recessive_syndrome	associated	with	abnormal	bone	structure	and	BMF	.	.
s2543	Collectively	,	our	data	illustrate	that	persistent	Hh	signaling	in	the	palatal	epithelium	contributes	to	the	etiology	and	pathogenesis	of	submucous	cleft_palate_through	its	interaction	with	a	positive_regulation_of_Notch_signaling_pathway	/	Irf6-dependent	biological	regulatory	loop	and	through	a	p63-induced	cell	adhesion	network	.
s228	Our	data	,	with	previously	published	reports	,	suggest	that	duplications	involving	cell_morphogenesis_and	DGKK	may	represent	a	new	syndromic	X	-	linked	ID	critical	region	associated	with	mild	to	severe	ID	,	speech_delay_+/-	dysarthria	,	attention	deficit	disorder	,	precocious	puberty	,	constipation	,	and	motor	delay	.	.
s1784	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	protein_phosphorylation	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s2445	Ras	-	association	domain	family	6	(	apoptotic_process	)	is	a	tumor_suppressor	that	interacts	with	MDM2	and	stabilizes	p53	.	.
s2676	Genes	harboring	the	most	significant	mutations	include	PCDH9	,	KLHL12	,	DCAF4L1	,	and	protein_ubiquitination_in	sporadic_HBs	,	and	ZNF814	,	DLG2	,	RIMS1	,	PNN	,	and	MUC7	in	familial	HBs	.	.
s3110	For	the	site	-	specific	delivery	of	the	anticancer_drug	into	TNBC	,	anti	-	Trop2	antibody	-	conjugated	nanoparticles	(	ST	-	positive_regulation_of_synaptic_transmission,_GABAergic	)	were	prepared	as	the	potential	nanocarrier	,	composed	of	carboxymethyl	dextran	(	CMD	)	derivatives	with	bioreducible	disulfide	bonds	.	.
s1232	Phaeochromocytoma	and	paraganglioma_(PHEO	/	tricarboxylic_acid_cycle	)	are	rare	tumours	with	an	estimated	annual	incidence	of	3	per	million	.	.
s2014	In	conclusion	,	the	inverse	relation	observed	between	bone	cell	activity	and	tumor_cell	oxidation	-	reduction_process_activity	in	prostate	cancer	bone	metastasis	may	be	of	importance	for	patient	response	to	AR	and/or	bone	targeting	therapies	,	but	needs	to	be	evaluated	in	clinical	settings	in	relation	to	serum	markers	for	bone	remodeling	,	radiography	and	patient	response	to	therapy	.	.
s2417	Serendipitously	,	we	found	that	overexpression	of	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_in	mouse	muscle	progenitor	cells	,	either	constitutively	during	development	or	inducibly	in	adult	animals	,	caused	severe	muscle	atrophy	with	features	reminiscent	of	cachexia	.	.
s532	Protein	kinase	A	(	PKA	)	signaling	pathway	including	AKAP12	,	regulation_of_cell_shape	,	and	RAB13	genes	were	identified	as	potential	mechanisms	for	the	activity	of	garlic	extract	in	cancer_prevention	.	.
s2357	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_might	be	a	new	drug	resistance	related	gene	in	pancreatic	cancer_cells	by	up	-	regulation	of	MRP2	expression	.
s1207	QM	-	biological_process_can	be	applied	to	clinical	samples	of	fresh	or	fixed	ductal	cells	,	ductal	fluid	,	nipple	fluid	,	fine	needle	aspirates	,	core	biopsies	,	and	tumor_tissue	sections	.
s2098	The	relationship	between	the	altered	expression	of	MACC1	,	c	-	MET	,	and	NM23-negative_regulation_of_cell_migration_and	pathological	microenvironmental	features	,	including	the	presence	of	tumor_budding	and	desmoplasia	,	were	assessed	.	.
s2342	By	combining	targeted	capture	of	129	known	deafness_genes	,	next	-	generation	sequencing	,	and	bioinformatic	analysis	,	we	identified	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_c.602TAAAAC	(	p	.	Leu201Pro	)	as	the	disease	-	causing	variant	.	.
s4028	Mutations	in	the	COL4A5	gene	result	in	X	-	linked	Alport	syndrome	,	homozygous	or	compound	heterozygous	mutations	in	activation_of_cysteine	-	type_endopeptidase_activity_involved_in_apoptotic_process_or	COL4A4	are	responsible	for	autosomal_recessive_Alport	syndrome	,	and	heterozygous	mutations	in	COL4A3	or	COL4A4	cause	autosomal	dominant	Alport	syndrome	or	benign	familial	hematuria	.	.
s984	RT	-	PCR	analysis	showed	that	the	overall	transcriptional	activity	of	the	main	HS	biosynthesis	-	involved	genes	(	EXT1	,	EXT2	,	NDST1	,	NDST2	,	GLCE	,	HS2ST1	,	HS3ST1	,	HS3ST2	,	HS6ST1	,	HS6ST2	,	negative_regulation_of_endothelial_cell_proliferation	,	SULF2	,	HPSE	)	was	decreased	by	1.5	-	2-fold	in	Grade	II	-	III	glioma_(p	AAAA	0.01	)	and	by	3-fold	in	Grade	IV	glioma	(	glioblastoma	multiforme	,	GBM	)	(	p	AAAA	0.05	)	,	as	compared	with	the	para	-	tumourous	tissue	.	.
s371	Previous	studies	have	implicated	coiled	-	coil	domain	-	containing	protein	8	(	negative_regulation_of_phosphatase_activity	)	as	a	tumor	suppressor	in	several	types	of	cancer	,	such	as	breast	and	prostate	cancers	.	.
s2344	Previously	we	implicated	four	missense	variants	in	the	X	-	linked	mRNA_export_from_nucleus_gene	in	intellectual_disability_(ID	)	.	.
s1546	Mechanistically	,	lncSHGL	recruited	heterogeneous_nuclear	ribonucleoprotein	A1	(	hnRNPA1	)	to	enhance	the	translation	efficiency	of	CALM	mRNAs	to	increase	calmodulin	(	negative_regulation_of_endothelial_cell_proliferation	)	protein	level	without	affecting	their	transcription	,	leading	to	the	activation	of	the	phosphatidyl	inositol	3-kinase	(	PI3K)/Akt	pathway	and	repression	of	the	mTOR	/	SREBP-1C	pathway	independent	of	insulin	and	calcium	in	hepatocytes	.	.
s1781	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	flagellated_sperm_motility	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s2570	The	aim	of	this	study	was	to	assess	the	relationship	between	the	DLEC1	,	TUSC4	and	mismatch_repair_mRNA	expression	,	and	clinical	features	of	NSCLC	patients	,	tobacco	addiction	,	and	tumour_histopathological	characteristics	.	.
s3884	rRNA_catabolic_process_encodes	a	catalytic	subunit	of	the	nuclear	RNA	exosome	complex	that	mediates	RNA	processing	and	decay	,	and	is	mutated	in	several	cancers	.	.
s2712	She	developed	gastrointestinal	symptoms	,	dysarthria	,	dysphagia_and	weakness	,	and	pyrimidine_nucleoside_metabolic_process_was	considered	due	to	its	low	TP	levels	and	improvement	after	platelet	transfusions	.	.
s2208	Given	the	lack	of	specific	targeted	genes	and	pathways	known	to	be	involved	in	tumour_cell	dormancy	,	we	proposed	enriched	candidate	genes	related	to	the	negative	regulation	of	cell	proliferation	,	signalling	pathways	regulating	pluripotency	of	stem	cells	and	neuroactive	ligand	-	receptor	interaction	,	and	3	hub	genes	(	intracellular_sequestering_of_iron_ion	,	GRM1	and	DDIT3	)	.	.
s1737	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	peptide_cross	-	linking	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s2576	The	DLEC1	,	TUSC4	and	mismatch_repair_expression	was	analysed	in	lung	tumour	tissue	samples	obtained	from	69	patients	diagnosed	with	NSCLC	,	squamous	cell	carcinoma	(	n	=	34	)	,	adenocarcinoma_(n	=	24	)	,	large	cell	carcinoma	(	n	=	5	)	,	carcinoma	adenosquamosum	(	n	=	5	)	.	.
s534	The	novel	aspects	of	this	study	are	the	direct	identification	of	serine	biosynthesis	as	a	critical	mechanism	of	protein_phosphorylation_V600E	inhibitor	resistance	and	the	first	successful	example	of	using	gemcitabine	+	BRAFis	in	combination	to	kill	previously	drug	-	resistant	cancer	cells	,	creating	the	translational	potential	of	pretreatment	with	gemcitabine	prior	to	BRAFi	treatment	of	tumor_cells	to	reverse	resistance	within	the	mutational	profile	and	the	WT	.	.
s2089	Also	,	we	examined	the	regulatory	mechanisms	of	programmed_cell_death_isoform	expression	by	testing	each	of	these	miRNAs	in	human	cancer_cell	lines	.	.
s202	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal	recessive	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	negative_regulation_of_protein_binding	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy_(SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s624	In	addition	,	we	found	that	FOXC1	regulation	of	RAB3GAP1	,	RAB3GAP2	and	exocytosis_affects	secretion	of	Myocilin	(	MYOC	)	,	a	protein	associated	with	juvenile	onset	glaucoma_and	steroid	-	induced	glaucoma	.	.
s61	The	created	databases	include	ACAD8	(	isobutyryl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	deficiency	(	IBD	)	)	,	ACADSB	(	short	-	chain	acyl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	(	SCAD	)	deficiency	)	,	AUH	(	3-methylglutaconic	aciduria	(	3-MGCA	)	)	,	DHCR7	(	Smith	-	Lemli	-	Opitz	syndrome	)	,	HMGCS2	(	3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl	-	CoA	synthase	2	deficiency	)	,	HSD17B10	(	17-beta	-	hydroxysteroid	dehydrogenase	X	deficiency	)	,	IRE1-mediated_unfolded_protein_response_(Ehlers	-	Danlos	syndrome	with	progressive	kyphoscoliosis	,	myopathy	,	and	hearing	loss	,	EDSKMH	)	and	ROGDI	(	Kohlschutter	-	Tonz	syndrome	)	.	.
s3533	Up	-	regulation	of	Smac	/	intrinsic_apoptotic_signaling_pathway_in_response_to_oxidative_stress_has	been	shown	to	increase	tumor_cell	chemotherapy	sensitivity	.	.
s2839	DNA_strand_renaturationR2	overexpression	is	associated	with	increased	risk	of	pelvic	lymph	node	metastasis	(	PLNM	,	p	=	0.001	)	and	cancer_relapse	(	p	=	0.009	)	.	.
s392	Developmental	exposure	to	endocrine	-	disrupting	chemicals	(	EDCs	)	,	17b	-	estradiol-3-benzoate	(	EB	)	and	bisphenol	A	(	response_to_wounding	)	,	increases	susceptibility	to	prostate	cancer_(PCa	)	in	rodent	models	.	.
s2696	In	summary	,	there	were	no	apparent	associations	of	variants	in	creatine_biosynthetic_process_and	SLC6A8	genes	with	autism	.	.
s2526	Fully	activated	regulation_of_cell_cycle_is	required	to	support	the	growth	in	CDK8-knockout	colon	cancer_cells	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	.	.
s724	With	this	data	-	driven	weighting	procedure	the	LRT	detected	significant	signal	in	genes	located	in	regions	already	confirmed	as	associated	with	schizophrenia_-	the	biological_process_(p	=	1.020e-06	)	and	the	VARS2	(	p	=	2.383e-06	)	;	in	the	Swedish	schizophrenia	case	-	control	cohort	of	11,040	individuals	with	exome	-	sequencing	data	.	.
s804	cell_proliferation_encodes	a	member	of	the	ovarian	tumor_domain	(	OTU)-containing	subfamily	of	deubiquitinating	enzymes	.	.
s98	Suggestive	evidence	of	association	was	found	for	the	D	-	serine	plasma	-	CSF	ratio	at	the	D	-	amino	-	acid	oxidase	(	DAO	)	gene	(	b=-0.28	,	P=9.08	x	10(-8	)	)	,	whereas	a	variant	in	L	-	serine_metabolic_process_(that	encodes	serine	racemase	and	is	associated	with	schizophrenia	)	constituted	the	most	strongly	associated	locus	for	the	L	-	serine	to	D	-	serine	ratio	in	CSF	.	.
s1156	Our	recent	determination	of	a	microRNA	(	miRNA	)	expresmelanosome_organizationon	signature	in	prostate	cancer_(PCa	)	revealed	that	miR-205	-	5p	was	significantly	reduced	in	PCa	tissues	and	that	it	acted	as	an	antitumor	miRNA	.	.
s4069	Moreover	,	the	overexpression	of	cerebral_cortex_development_was	closely	related	to	tumor	differentiation	,	depth	of	invasion	,	clinical	stage	and	lymphatic	metastasis	in	gastric	cancer	.	.
s1387	This	study	examined	defense_response_to_virus_content	and	distribution	in	glioblastoma	multiforme	(	GBM	)	tissues	in	the	context	of	potential	molecular	mechanisms	underlying	its	deregulation	in	brain	tumours	.	.
s2008	Importantly	,	bone	cell	activity	was	inversely	correlated	to	tumor_cell	AR	activity	(	measured	as	AR	,	FOXA1	,	HOXB13	,	regulation_of_systemic_arterial_blood_pressure	,	KLK3	,	NKX3	-	1	,	STEAP2	,	and	TMPRSS2	expression	)	and	to	patient	serum	prostate	-	specific	antigen	(	PSA	)	levels	.	.
s3717	In	this	study	,	we	examined	the	potential	for	genetic	susceptibility	to	schizophrenia_of	a	three	-	gene	cluster	region	,	toxin_metabolic_process	-	CNNM2-NT5C2	.	.
s1146	We	investigated	which	host	factors	control	NETs	in	vivo	and	found	that	two	deoxyribonucleases	(	DNases	)	,	DNA_catabolic_process,_endonucleolytic_and	DNase1-like	3	,	degraded	NETs	in	circulation	during	sterile	neutrophilia_and	septicemia	.	.
s504	In	conclusion	,	we	identified	relevant	genetic	variations	in	up	to	15	%	of	cases	after	exclusion	of	polyglutamine	expansion	spinocerebellar	ataxias	,	and	confirmed	CACNA1A	and	regulation_of_mitochondrial_membrane_permeability_as	major	ataxia	genes	.	.
s168	The	overlap	of	axonal	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	with	both	diseases	,	as	well	as	the	common	autosomal_recessive_inheritance	pattern	of	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	in	three	related	patients	,	prompted	us	to	analyse	the	ALS5/SPG11/chemical_synaptic_transmission_gene	in	affected	individuals	with	autosomal	recessive	axonal	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	.	.
s592	Gene	-	based	tests	highlighted	20	additional	genes	of	which	5	had	previously	been	associated	to	schizophrenia	and/or	bipolar_disorder	,	CSMD1	,	CCDC141	,	SLC1A2	,	positive_regulation_of_cytosolic_calcium_ion_concentration	,	and	SNAP25	.	.
s136	Surprisingly	,	we	detected	no	ADAM2	,	biological_process_and	SAGE1	in	the	67	lung	cancers	(	mainly	non	-	small	lung	cancer	)	and	189	breast	cancers	,	while	MAGE	-	A	proteins	were	present	in	15	%	and	7	-	16	%	of	these	tumor_types	,	respectively	.	.
s3021	We	observed	that	the	alternatively	spliced	transcripts	of	a	subset	of	these	genes	,	involved	in	proliferation	and	tumor_cell	migration	like	REPIN1/AP4	,	ST3GAL6	,	TRNAU1AP	and	PFKM	are	degraded	upon	loss	of	peptidyl	-	arginine_N	-	methylation	.	.
s3514	Furthermore	,	the	xenograft	study	confirmed	the	tumor_proliferation	-	promoting	role	of	SPRY4-centrosome_cycle_in	PANC1	cells	.	.
s1725	miR-142	-	3p	overexpression	resulted	in	a	strong	decline	in	breast	cancer_stem	cell	characteristics	with	a	decrease	in	CD44	,	CD133	,	ALDH1	,	Bod1	,	mitotic_cytokinesis	,	and	mammosphere	formation	as	well	as	reduced	survival	after	irradiation	.	.
s1213	neuron_projection_development_encodes	dysbindin	protein	,	which	is	localized	to	synaptic	sites	and	is	reduced	in	the	prefrontal	cortex	and	hippocampus	of	patients	with	schizophrenia	,	indicating	a	potential	role	in	schizophrenia	etiology	.	.
s1265	Conclusion	,	Cases	with	nuclear	-	transcribed_mRNA_catabolic_process_gene	defects	often	manifests	as	short	stature	,	optic	nerve	atrophy	,	Pelger	-	Huet	anomaly	,	skeletal_dysplasia	,	recurrent	infections	,	abnormality	of	liver	enzymes	,	progeroid	appearance	,	proptosis	,	hypotonia	and	immunodeficiency	.	.
s3812	The	tumor_cells	resembled	pro	-	B	cells	,	and	were	CD19+IgM	-	IgD	-	CD93+CD43+CD21-CD23-VpreB+CXCR4	+	Consistent	with	the	pro	-	B	-	cell	stage	of	B	-	cell	development	,	microarray	analysis	revealed	enrichment	of	transcripts	,	including	Rag1	,	Rag2	,	CD93	,	Vpreb1	,	Vpreb3	,	and	phagocytosis,_recognition_We	confirmed	RAG1	expression	in	Tg26	tumors	,	and	hypothesized	that	HIV-1	matrix	protein	p17	may	directly	induce	RAG1	in	B	cells	.	.
s1818	To	investigate	the	mechanism	of	protein_autophosphorylation	-	type	deafness	,	we	established	a	mouse	model	of	Myo3a	kinase	domain	Y137C	mutation	by	using	CRISPR	/	Cas9	system	.	.
s930	The	impact	of	superoxide_metabolic_process_and	ROS	on	cancer_development	is	only	partly	explored	.	.
s774	Naive	CD4	+	T	cells	adhere	to	tumor_slices	in	proportion	to	the	abundance	of	monocyte_chemotaxis	-	producing	macrophages	.	.
s3111	Consequently	,	DOX	-	ST	-	NPs	exhibited	higher	toxicity	to	negative_regulation_of_epithelial_cell_migration	-	positive	MDA	-	MB-231	cancer_cells	,	compared	to	DOX	-	loaded	control	nanoparticles	without	the	disulfide	bond	or	anti	-	Trop2	antibody	.	.
s686	Up	to	half	of	patients	with	positive_regulation_of_cell_migration	/	PGL	and	renal	neoplasia_had	VHL	syndrome	,	SDH	deficiency	,	or	alterations	in	TMEM127	.	.
s3416	Hepatocyte	growth	factor	(	neutrophil_apoptotic_process)/c	-	MET	signaling	plays	an	important	role	in	cell	proliferation	,	survival	,	migration	and	motility	of	cancer_cells	.	.
s2416	We	found	that	y	-	OH	-	cellular_amino_acid_metabolic_process_and	a	-	methyl	-	y	-	OH	-	PdG	are	the	major	adducts	formed	in	tobacco	smokers	_	buccal	cells	as	well	as	the	normal	lung	tissues	of	tobacco	-	smoking	lung	cancer_patients	,	but	not	in	lung	tissues	of	nonsmokers	.	.
s2373	In	the	two	populations	with	the	largest	sample	size	,	the	probability	of	breast	cancer_generally	increases	as	anti	-	cation_transport_antibody	levels	increase	.	.
s3171	Type	II	(	middle	type	)	patients	show	development	delay	and	the	distinctive	facial	phenotype	(	midface	retraction	,	short	and	upturned	nose	)	,	lacking	both	hydronephrosis_and	typical	skeletal	abnormalities	,	with	existence	of	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_IImutation	.	.
s2298	Mutations	in	ACVRL1	,	BMPR2	,	or	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_are	associated	with	hereditary	hemorrhagic	telangiectasia	and	pulmonary_arterial_hypertension_in	humans	[	1	,	2	]	.	.
s3038	Mutations	,	A147	T	and	A165V	,	within	the	ZM	of	sarcomere_organization	-	LDex10	cause	myofibrillar	myopathy	,	but	the	mechanism	is	unknown	.	.
s369	Similar	findings	were	observed	in	a	patient	with	chronic	hypophosphatemia_as	a	result	of	a	mutation	in	sodium_ion_transport_who	had	a	50	%	reduction	in	both	serum	Pi	content	and	muscle	VATP	After	oral	Pi	repletion	and	normalization	of	serum	Pi	levels	,	muscle	VATP	completely	normalized	in	the	patient	.	.
s2817	Collagen	type	4	alpha	1	(	branching_involved_in_blood_vessel_morphogenesis	)	and	collagen	type	13	alpha	1	(	COL13A1	)	produced	by	urothelial	cancer_cells	support	the	vital	oncogenic	property	of	tumor	invasion	.	.
s3132	Mutations	in	skeletal_muscle_contraction_and	MYH8	are	associated	with	distal	arthrogryposis_syndromes	.	.

s23	Collectively	,	our	study	uncovers	a	protein	complex	,	which	consists	of	regulation_of_double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination_and	KIAA0146/SPIDR	,	in	DNA	repair	and	provides	potential	directions	for	cancer_diagnosis	and	therapy	.	.
s3681	The	ichthyosis_genetic	panel	showed	mutations	in	the	lipid_transport_gene	resulting	in	the	lamellar	ichthyosis	phenotype	of	ARCI	.	.
s1151	We	conclude	that	loss	of	oncogenic	protein_polyubiquitination-1274a	reduced	cancer_cell	proliferation	and	induced	apoptosis	in	ccRCC	through	targeting	BMPR1B.	.
s3163	Prominent	examples	include	mutations	in	the	transporters	for	dopamine	(	DAT	,	monoamine_transport	)	,	for	creatine	(	CT1	,	SLC6A8	)	,	and	for	glycine	(	GlyT2	,	SLC6A5	)	,	which	result	in	infantile	dystonia	,	mental	retardation	,	and	hyperekplexia	,	respectively	.	.
s3541	In	the	present	study	,	we	used	a	custom	capture	panel	(	MiamiOtoGenes	)	to	target	sequence	180	deafness	-	associated	genes	in	5	gap_junction_assembly_negative	deaf	probands	with	autosomal_recessive_nonsyndromic	HL	from	Iran	.	.
s1824	Unlike	patients	with	ECTD-9	,	Hoxc13-mutated	mice	and	attachment_of_GPI_anchor_to_protein_do	not	faithfully	recapitulate	the	phenotype	of	hypotrichosis	,	so	there	is	a	limited	understanding	of	the	molecular	mechanism	of	Hoxc13-mediated	hypotrichosis	in	animal	models	and	clinically	.	.
s2654	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II/4/5	factors	are	often	overexpressed	in	prostate	cancer_and	genome	-	wide	studies	in	a	prostate	cancer	cell	line	indicate	that	ETV4	and	MED25	occupy	enhancers	that	are	enriched	for	ETS	-	binding	sequences	and	are	both	functionally	important	for	the	transcription	of	genes	regulated	by	these	enhancers	.	.
s3582	With	a	feature	selection	algorithm	,	we	selected	a	panel	of	five	urinary	biomarkers	(	FTL	,	Ferritin	light	chain	,	MAPK1IP1L	,	Mitogen	-	Activated	Protein	Kinase	1	Interacting	Protein	1	Like	,	FGB	,	Fibrinogen	Beta	Chain	,	RAB33B	,	RAB33B	,	Member	RAS	Oncogene	Family	,	RAB15	,	RAB15	,	Member	RAS	Oncogene	Family	)	and	established	a	combinatorial	model	that	can	correctly	classify	the	majority	of	lung	cancer_cases	both	in	the	training	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_(n=46	)	and	the	test	sets	(	n=14	-	47	per	set	)	with	an	AUC	ranging	from	0.8747	to	0.9853	.	.
s3001	While	direct	pharmacological	inhibition	of	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_has	proven	challenging	,	its	aberrant	activation	rewires	biochemical	networks	in	cancer_cells	that	may	create	special	vulnerabilities	.	.
s2229	We	previously	demonstrated	that	phospho	-	mTOR	expression	is	associated	with	tumor	aggressiveness	,	therapy	resistance	,	and	lower	mRNA	expression	of	SLC5A5	in	papillary_thyroid_carcinoma_(PTC	)	,	while	phospho	-	positive_regulation_of_RNA_polymerase_II_transcriptional_preinitiation_complex_assembly_(mTORC1	effector	)	expression	was	associated	with	less	aggressive	clinicopathological	features	.	.
s1932	single_strand_break_repair_plays	an	essential	role	in	the	resistance	of	cancer_cells	to	currently	used	antitumour	drugs	based	on	Top1	inhibitors	such	as	topotecan	and	irinotecan	.	.
s2757	Our	analyses	identified	15	CpG	sites	within	the	cellular_response_to_DNA_damage_stimulus_1A	promoter	that	were	significantly	hypermethylated	and	14	CpG	loci	within	the	NFATC1	gene	body	that	were	significantly	hypomethylated	(	pLIS	AAAA	1	x	10	-	5	)	in	the	tumours	of	active	smokers	.	.

s1089	In	Japan	,	26	mutations	in	the	endoplasmic_reticulum_calcium_ion_homeostasis_gene	in	7	pedigrees	and	19	sporadic_cases	with	DD	have	been	reported	,	among	which	one	pedigree	and	one	sporadic	case	were	accompanied	by	neuropsychiatric	symptoms	.	.
s2622	To	the	best	of	our	knowledge	,	this	is	the	first	report	describing	sporadic_XLID	with	de	novo	peptidyl	-	L	-	cysteine_S	-	palmitoylation_mutation	identified	by	targeted	next	-	generation	sequencing	.
s1765	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	lipid_hydroxylation	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.

s1835	Taken	together	,	these	findings	suggest	an	intriguing	hypothesis	that	colorectal	cancer_arises	in	a	microenvironment	of	functional	cGMP_biosynthetic_process_inactivation	,	which	can	be	repaired	by	oral	ligand	replacement	.	.
s1092	In	anticipation	of	the	proliferation	of	time	series	data	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templateds	in	the	near	future	,	we	use	the	Hopfield	model	,	a	recurrent	neural	network	based	on	spin	glasses	,	to	model	the	dynamics	of	cell	cycle	in	HeLa	(	human	cervical	cancer	)	and	S.	cerevisiae	cells	.	.

s3770	We	identified	30	new	blood	pressure-	or	hypertension	-	associated	genetic	regions	in	the	general	population	,	including	3	rare	missense	variants	in	RBM47	,	growth_plate_cartilage_chondrocyte_morphogenesis_and	RRAS	with	larger	effects	(	AAAA1.5	mm	Hg	/	allele	)	than	common	variants	.	.
s359	Missense	mutations	in	the	mitochondrial	seryl	-	tRNA	synthetase	gene	,	seryl	-	tRNA_aminoacylation	,	have	been	identified	in	HUPRA	syndrome	(	hyperuricemia	,	pulmonary	hypertension	,	renal_failure_in	infancy	,	and	alkalosis	)	.	.
s1127	These	3	patients	shared	congenital	neutropenia_linked	with	various	other	mitotic_spindle_organization_phenotypes	.	.
s1233	Phaeochromocytoma	and	paraganglioma	(	PHEO	/	tricarboxylic_acid_cycle	)	are	rare	tumours	with	an	estimated	annual	incidence	of	3	per	million	.	.
s2201	Taken	together	,	these	results	suggested	that	regulation_of_inflammatory_response_may	serve	a	key	role	in	breast	cancer_development	by	upregulating	EGFR	and	subsequently	activating	the	AKT	/	Skp2	feedback	loop	pathway	.	.
s135	Surprisingly	,	we	detected	no	binding_of_sperm_to_zona_pellucida	,	CALR3	and	SAGE1	in	the	67	lung	cancers	(	mainly	non	-	small	lung	cancer	)	and	189	breast	cancers	,	while	MAGE	-	A	proteins	were	present	in	15	%	and	7	-	16	%	of	these	tumor_types	,	respectively	.	.
s1738	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	keratinization	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s635	We	examined	47628	SNPs	in	61	regulation_of_cell_growth_pathway	genes	in	the	genome	wide	association	study	of	breast	cancer_in	the	African	Diaspora	study	(	The	Root	consortium	)	,	which	included	3686	participants	(	1657	cases	)	.	.
s2217	RNA_catabolic_process_deficiency	in	humans	is	associated	with	infant	cystic	leukoencephalopathy	,	which	causes	psychomotor	impairment	,	spasticity	and	epilepsy	.	.
s617	On	the	other	hand	,	MYH1	,	MYH2	,	MYH3	,	MYH7	,	MYH8	,	FOXO3	,	NFATC1	,	PTGS2	,	KAT6B	,	HDAC4	,	and	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_expression	is	suspected	to	be	involved	in	the	epigenetic	regulations	behind	the	mandibular	prognathism_phenotype	.
s2131	Some	genes	,	such	as	glutathione_metabolic_process	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s749	Here	de	novo	missense	mutations	in	the	RPS23	gene	,	which	codes	for	uS12	,	are	reported	in	two	unrelated	individuals	with	microcephaly	,	hearing	loss	,	and	overlapnegative_regulation_of_endopeptidase_activityng	dysmorphic	features	.	.
s408	We	describe	an	autosomal	dominant	inherited	pedigree	with	sarcomere_organization	-	MFM	that	is	in	line	with	the	typical	phenotype	of	distal	myopathy	without	cardiomyopathy	and	neuropathy	,	while	mild	asymmetrical	muscle	atrophy	can	be	observed	in	some	affected	members	.	.
s2566	Finally	,	the	simultaneous	increase	of	long	-	chain_fatty_acid_metabolic_process	,	CACT	and	CrAT	is	fundamental	for	PCCs	to	sustain	FA	oxidation	in	the	presence	of	heavy	lipid	load	on	prostate	cancer_mitochondria	.	.
s2187	Until	now	,	more	than	90	positive_regulation_of_receptor_internalizationR	mutations	relevant	to	human	short_stature_(Laron	syndrome	and	idiopathic	short	stature	)	,	including	deletions	,	missense	,	nonsense	,	frameshift	,	and	splice	site	mutations	,	and	four	GHR	defects	associated	with	chicken	dwarfism	,	have	been	described	.	.
s1653	Lynch	syndrome	(	LS	)	patients	with	isolated	mismatch_repair_loss	in	the	colon	cancer	,	while	intact	MMR	in	the	prostate	cancer	,	are	exceedingly	rare	.	.
s2048	Pathogenic	or	likely	pathogenic	cancer_susceptibility	gene	alterations	were	found	in	7	of	the	87	(	8	%	)	CS	/	CS	-	like	and	BRRS	patients	and	included	MUTYH	,	RET	,	TSC2	,	BRCA1	,	mitotic_cytokinesis	,	ERCC2	and	HRAS	.	.
s31	Increasing	evidence	shows	that	patients	with	glycogen_metabolic_process_mutations	have	a	severe	hepatic	phenotype	within	the	heterogeneous_GSD	IX	disorder	.	.
s465	In	patients	with	thyroid	cancer	,	a	positive	correlation	between	regulation_of_synaptic_transmission,_glycinergic-5,2	and	PARP-1	was	identified	,	and	low	SLC6A9	-	5,2	expression	was	associated	with	a	worse	prognosis	of	papillary	thyroid	carcinoma	.	.
s2665	Importantly	,	extreme	limiting	dilution	analysis	revealed	that	even	1	x	102	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	-	transduced	cells	could	form	tumors	in	vivo	,	indicating	that	ZNF687	contributes	to	HCC	recurrence	.	.
s1489	Curcumin	decreased	the	expression	of	steroidogenic	acute	regulatory	proteins	,	CYP11A1	and	steroid_biosynthetic_process_in	prostate	cancer_cell	lines	,	supporting	the	decrease	of	testosterone	production	.	.
s1317	Fourteen	different	(	half	of	them	novel	)	non	-	GJB2	variants	causing	HL	were	found	in	10	genes	(	skeletal_system_development	,	HDAC8	,	MITF	,	NEFL	,	OTOF	,	SF3B4	,	SLC26A4	,	TECTA	,	TMPRSS3	,	USH2A	)	among	13	probands	,	confirming	the	genetic	heterogeneity_of	hereditary	HL	.	.
s1467	These	changes	were	accompanied	by	cortical_atrophy_as	well	as	increased	expression	of	angiogenesis	-	related	genes	such	as	Vegfa	,	regulation_of_signaling_receptor_activity	,	and	Plau	in	CD31-positive	endothelial	cells	.	.
s876	Metabolic	cutis	laxa	results	from	Menkes	syndrome	,	caused	by	a	defect	in	the	ATPase	copper	transporting	alpha	(	ATP7A	)	gene	,	congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	due	to	mutations	in	subunit	7	of	the	component	of	oligomeric	Golgi	(	COG7)-congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	(	CDG	)	complex	,	combined	disorder	of	N-	and	O	-	linked	glycosylation	,	due	to	mutations	in	ATPase	H+	transporting	V0	subunit	a2	(	ATP6VOA2	)	gene	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	reductase	1	deficiency	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	synthase	deficiency	,	macrocephaly	,	alopecia	,	cutis	laxa	,	and	scoliosis_(MACS	)	syndrome	,	due	to	Ras	and	Rab	interactor	2	(	RIN2	)	mutations	,	transaldolase	deficiency	caused	by	mutations	in	the	transaldolase	1	(	TALDO1	)	gene	,	Gerodermia	osteodysplastica	due	to	mutations	in	the	golgin	,	RAB6-interacting	(	GORAB	or	SCYL1BP1	)	gene	,	and	mitogen	-	activated	pathway	(	MAP	)	kinase	defects	,	caused	by	mutations	in	several	genes	[	protein	tyrosine	phosphatase	,	non	-	receptor	-	type	11	(	PTPN11	)	,	RAF	,	NF	,	HRas	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	HRAS	)	,	B	-	Raf	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	BRAF	)	,	MEK1/2	,	KRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	KRAS	)	,	SOS	Ras	/	Rho	guanine	nucleotide	exchange	factor	2	(	SOS2	)	,	leucine	rich	repeat	scaffold	protein	(	positive_regulation_of_Ras_protein_signal_transduction	)	,	NRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	NRAS	)	,	and	Raf-1	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	RAF1	)	]	,	which	regulate	the	Ras	-	MAPK	cascade	.	.
s3905	histone_dephosphorylation	,	one	of	the	four	members	of	the	EYA	gene	family	,	is	associated	with	several	human	cancers	.	.
s828	Independent	and	pooled	analyses	verified	that	higher	proline_biosynthetic_process_mRNA	levels	were	significantly	associated	with	poor	survival	of	breast	cancer_patients	,	regardless	of	estrogen	receptor	(	ER	)	status	.	.
s2175	An	abnormality	in	the	miRNA_catabolic_process	/	let-7a	axis	is	relevant	to	the	progression	of	hepatitis	B	virus	(	HBV)-positive	hepatocellular_carcinoma_(HCC	)	,	which	could	be	a	novel	therapeutic	target	for	this	malignant	tumor	.	.
s2972	Many	cancer	-	causing	chromosomal	translocations	result	in	transactivating	protein	products	encoding	FET	family	(	mRNA_splicing,_via_spliceosome	,	EWSR1	,	TAF15	)	low	-	complexity	(	LC	)	domains	fused	to	a	DNA	binding	domain	from	one	of	several	transcription	factors	.	.
s3819	These	findings	suggest	that	protein_dephosphorylation_promotes	tumorigenicity	,	stemness	and	drug	resistance	in	ovarian	cancer	,	and	thus	is	a	potential	therapeutic	target	for	the	treatment	of	ovarian	cancer	.
s2140	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	protein_phosphorylation	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s2529	Together	,	these	observations	suggest	that	Zyxin	promotes	colon	cancer_tumorigenesis	in	a	mitotic	-	phosphorylation	-	dependent	manner	and	through	protein_phosphorylation	-	mediated	YAP	activation	.
s883	The	PHKG2	and	RNF40	genes	are	either	overlapping	or	close	to	the	sequences	of	SCAR	marker	BC13	-	4	,	while	SCAR	marker	BC10	-	1	is	in	the	intron	and	overlap	the	antibiotic_metabolic_process_gene	,	suggesting	that	alterations	in	the	expression	of	these	genes	could	contribute	to	cancer_progression	.	.
s1695	The	negative_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_mutations	were	also	identified	in	cortisol	-	producing	adenomas	and	adrenal	cancer	,	but	their	role	in	APA	development	and	the	mechanisms	specifying	the	hormonal	production	or	the	malignant	phenotype	remain	unknown	.	.
s3778	Bardet	-	Biedl	syndrome	(	visual_perception	)	is	an	autosomal_recessive_disorder	that	is	both	genetically	and	clinically	heterogeneous	.	.
s123	We	previously	mapped	a	locus	(	ahl8	)	contributing	to	the	progressive	hearing_loss_of	monocyte_chemotaxis/2J	(	D2	)	mice	and	later	showed	that	a	missense	variant	of	the	Fscn2	gene	,	unique	to	the	D2	inbred	strain	,	was	responsible	for	the	ahl8	effect	.	.
s1764	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s2720	The	more	common	member	of	this	family	,	intraductal	papillary	mucinous	neoplasm	,	often	carries	genetic	alterations	typical	of	pancreatic	infiltrating	ductal	adenocarcinoma	(	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	,	TP53	,	and	CDKN2A	)	but	additionally	has	mutations	in	GNAS	and	RNF43	genes	.	.
s2863	Mutations	affecting	human	COG1	,	COG2	and	retrograde_vesicle	-	mediated_transport,_Golgi_to_ER	-	COG8	cause	monogenic	forms	of	inherited	,	autosomal_recessive_CDGs	.	.
s1783	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	spermatid_development_and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s1178	The	present	study	aimed	to	investigate	the	relationship	between	the	expression	of	collagen	and	calcium	-	binding	epidermal	growth	factor	domain	-	containing	protein	1	(	CCBE1	)	and	lymphatic	vessel	endothelial	hyaluronan	receptor	1	(	cell	-	matrix_adhesion	)	in	tumor_tissue	with	the	clinical	prognosis	of	lung	cancer	.	.
s4015	This	similarity	was	revealed	by	the	same	number	of	passages	,	the	same	germ	cell	clusters	formation	and	similar	level	of	genes	expression	of	spermatogonial	markers	including	ubiquitin	carboxyl	-	terminal	esterase	L1	(	UCHL1	)	,	zinc	finger	and	BTB	domain	containing	16	(	ZBTB16	)	and	glial	cell	line	-	derived	neurotrophic	factor	family	receptor	alpha	1	(	GFRA1	)	,	as	well	as	germ	cell	differentiation	markers	including	signal	transducer	and	activator	of	transcription	3	(	regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	)	,	spermatogenesis	and	oogenesis	specific	basic	helix	-	loophelix	2	(	SOHLH2	)	,	v	-	kit	Hardy	-	Zuckerman	4	feline	sarcoma_viral	oncogene	homolog	(	KIT	)	and	synaptonemal	complex	protein	3	(	SYCP3	)	.	.
s3603	Regarding	the	important	role	of	arginine	(	Arg	)	in	the	regulation	of	multiple	metabolic	and	signaling	pathways	,	its	deprivation	has	been	proposed	as	a	good	strategy	for	tumor_regression	in	tumors	with	defected	Arg	metabolic	enzymes	like	argininosuccinate	synthase	1	(	circadian_rhythm	)	.	.
s526	Knockdown	of	response_to_drug_resulted	in	significant	radiosensitization	of	HeLa	(	cervical	)	,	PSN-1	(	pancreatic	)	,	and	T24	(	bladder	)	,	BT-549	(	breast	)	and	MCF7	(	breast	)	tumor_lines	as	measured	by	colony	formation	assays	.	.
s3993	The	aims	of	the	present	study	were	to	evaluate	the	relation	of	dysregulated	MACC1	,	c	-	endothelial_cell_morphogenesis	,	and	NM23-H1	expression	with	the	histopathological	features	of	tumors	in	recurrence	formation	in	eCC	cases	.	.
s3515	The	analysis	of	the	two	exons	of	synapse_assembly_gene	in	a	Moroccan	family	allowed	us	to	identify	a	novel	single	deleterious	mutation	c.696delG	,	p	.	Trp232Cysfs	10	at	homozygous	state	in	the	exon	2	of	the	SLITRK6	,	a	gene	reported	to	cause	deafness_and	myopia	in	various	populations	.
s1104	A	10-year	-	old	girl	had	progressive	neurologic	deterioration	,	macular	cherry	-	protein_phosphorylation_spot	,	and	cornea_verticillata	.	.
s3580	With	a	feature	selection	algorithm	,	we	selected	a	panel	of	five	urinary	biomarkers	(	FTL	,	Ferritin	light	chain	,	MAPK1IP1L	,	Mitogen	-	Activated	Protein	Kinase	1	Interacting	Protein	1	Like	,	FGB	,	Fibrinogen	Beta	Chain	,	regulation_of_cell_growth	,	RAB33B	,	Member	RAS	Oncogene	Family	,	RAB15	,	RAB15	,	Member	RAS	Oncogene	Family	)	and	established	a	combinatorial	model	that	can	correctly	classify	the	majority	of	lung	cancer_cases	both	in	the	training	set	(	n=46	)	and	the	test	sets	(	n=14	-	47	per	set	)	with	an	AUC	ranging	from	0.8747	to	0.9853	.	.
s3069	Pathogenic	sequence	variants	in	the	Sorting	Nexin	10	(	endosome_organization	)	gene	have	been	associated	with	autosomal_recessive_osteopetrosis	(	ARO	)	in	human	.	.
s3065	Our	data	implicate	rare	variants	in	the	AGS	genes	ADAR	and	RNA_catabolic_process_and	a	type	I	interferon	signature	in	glioma_and	prostate	carcinoma	risk	and	tumorigenesis	,	consistent	with	a	genetic	basis	underlying	inflammation	-	driven	malignant	transformation	in	glioma	and	prostate	carcinoma	development	.
s1857	Genetic	alterations	in	the	expression	of	multicellular_organism_development_have	been	related	to	different	neurologic	conditions	and	more	particularly	to	autism_spectrum	disorders	(	ASD	)	.	.
s395	To	gain	insight	into	the	molecular	basis	of	the	heterogeneous_phenotype	observed	in	men	with	the	deletion	we	defined	the	type	of	DAZ	and	spermatogenesis_genes	deleted	.	.
s2989	HCRP1	downregulation	was	found	in	57	of	137	human	gastric	cancer_samples	and	correlated	with	advanced	TNM	stage	,	positive	positive_regulation_of_cysteine	-	type_endopeptidase_activity_involved_in_apoptotic_process_status	,	and	relapse	.	.
s3234	A	dominant	substitution	(	p	.	Arg544Gln	)	of	endothelial_cell_morphogenesisTL13	,	encoding	a	predicted	methyltransferase	,	is	the	DFNM1	suppressor	of	GAB1-associated	deafness	.	.
s446	There	was	a	statistically	significant	difference	in	RASSF1	gene	methylation	between	SMARCB1/nucleosome_disassembly	-	deficient	and	SMARCB1/INI1-positive	tumors	(	p=0.0095	)	.	.
s572	We	observed	a	dichotomous	pattern	of	programmed_cell_death_expression	,	in	which	postmitotic	neurons	throughout	the	brain	expressed	the	constitutively	active	PKM1	isoform	,	while	neural	progenitors	and	medulloblastomas	exclusively	expressed	the	less	active	PKM2	.	.
s1767	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	biological_process	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s3550	Primary	distal_renal_tubular_acidosis_(dRTA	)	caused	by	mutations	of	the	anion_transport_gene	,	which	encodes	for	erythroid	and	kidney	isoforms	of	anion	exchanger	,	shows	marked	difference	in	inheritance	patterns	and	clinical	features	in	different	parts	of	the	world	.	.
s3754	Bartter	syndrome	type	IV	,	characterized	by	salt	-	losing	nephropathies	and	sensorineural	deafness	,	is	caused	by	mutations	of	ion_transmembrane_transport_or	simultaneous	mutations	of	both	CLCNKA	and	CLCNKB	.	.
s694	Altogether	these	data	demonstrate	that	mutations	in	negative_regulation_of_protein_kinase_activity_cause	a	congenital	muscular	dystrophy	syndrome	with	short_stature	,	cataracts	,	and	intellectual	disability	.
s849	Metabolic	cutis	laxa	results	from	Menkes	syndrome	,	caused	by	a	defect	in	the	ATPase	copper	transporting	alpha	(	ATP7A	)	gene	,	congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	due	to	mutations	in	subunit	7	of	the	component	of	oligomeric	Golgi	(	COG7)-congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	(	CDG	)	complex	,	combined	disorder	of	N-	and	O	-	linked	glycosylation	,	due	to	mutations	in	ATPase	H+	transporting	V0	subunit	a2	(	ATP6VOA2	)	gene	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	reductase	1	deficiency	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	synthase	deficiency	,	macrocephaly	,	alopecia	,	cutis	laxa	,	and	scoliosis	(	MACS	)	syndrome	,	due	to	Ras	and	Rab	interactor	2	(	RIN2	)	mutations	,	transaldolase	deficiency	caused	by	mutations	in	the	transaldolase	1	(	TALDO1	)	gene	,	Gerodermia	osteodysplastica	due	to	mutations	in	the	golgin	,	peptidyl	-	cysteine_methylation	-	interacting	(	GORAB	or	SCYL1BP1	)	gene	,	and	mitogen	-	activated	pathway	(	MAP	)	kinase	defects	,	caused	by	mutations	in	several	genes	[	protein	tyrosine	phosphatase	,	non	-	receptor	-	type	11	(	PTPN11	)	,	RAF	,	NF	,	HRas	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	HRAS	)	,	B	-	Raf	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	BRAF	)	,	MEK1/2	,	KRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	KRAS	)	,	SOS	Ras	/	Rho	guanine	nucleotide	exchange	factor	2	(	SOS2	)	,	leucine	rich	repeat	scaffold	protein	(	SHOC2	)	,	NRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	NRAS	)	,	and	Raf-1	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	RAF1	)	]	,	which	regulate	the	Ras	-	MAPK	cascade	.	.
s3004	Through	gene	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_enrichment	analysis	and	bi	-	clustering	,	we	also	found	that	most	of	the	differential	expressed	lncRNAs	were	closely	associated	with	mitochondrial_functions	(	e.g.	mitochondrion	organization	,	P=3.21x10	-	17	,	mitochondrial	ATP	synthesis	coupled	electron	transport	,	P=1.73x10	-	19	and	mitochondrial	membrane	organization	,	P=4.04x10	-	8	)	.	.
s1585	Here	we	show	that	the	transcription	factor	pleomorphic	adenoma	gene	1	(	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	)	is	a	microRNA	target	gene	that	is	overexpressed	in	Wilms	tumors	with	mutations	in	microRNA	processing	genes	.	.
s1529	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	ubiquitin	-	dependent_protein_catabolic_process	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s1364	However	,	because	dicumarol	did	not	affect	well	-	known	apoptosis	inducers	,	such	as	anti	-	osteoblast_differentiation_IgG	,	tumor_necrosis	factor	(	TNF)-a	,	TNF	-	related	apoptosis	-	inducing	ligand	,	UV	-	B	and	H2O2	of	HeLa	cells	at	all	,	we	concluded	that	NQO1-related	intracellular	reduction	of	CoQ	,	or	its	reduced	product	,	ubiquinol	,	may	participate	in	the	apoptosis	induction	of	HeLa	cells	.
s2974	Many	cancer	-	causing	chromosomal	translocations	result	in	transactivating	protein	products	encoding	FET	family	(	FUS	,	EWSR1	,	transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	)	low	-	complexity	(	LC	)	domains	fused	to	a	DNA	binding	domain	from	one	of	several	transcription	factors	.	.
s2925	Lastly	,	a	syndromic	form	of	PCD	with	retinal_degeneration_results	in	normal	ciliary	ultrastructure	through	mutations	in	the	visual_perception_gene	.	.
s3821	Oncogenic	mutations	in	the	PI3K	/	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_pathway	are	present	in	nearly	half	of	human	tumors	.	.
s429	Connectivity	mapping	identified	vinblastine	and	vincristine	as	agents	that	could	reverse	the	photoreceptor_cell_maintenance	/	HOX	genes	/	LIM2-signature	,	and	we	confirmed	this	by	in	vitro	analysis	in	glioma_cell	lines	,	demonstrating	that	CD133	and	HOX	genes	were	co	-	expressed	and	could	be	downregulated	by	vincristine	.	.
s3169	Bardet	-	Biedl	Syndrome	(	visual_perception	)	is	a	rare	multi	-	systemic	disease	with	autosomal_recessive_transmission	.	.
s3047	Our	findings	enlarge	the	spectrum	of	tubulinopathies	and	emphasize	that	mutations	of	microtubule_cytoskeleton_organization_should	be	considered	in	patients	with	congenital	non	-	progressive	facial_palsy	.	.
s2486	Although	chaperone	-	mediated_protein_folding_is	ubiquitously	present	,	it	is	particularly	abundant	in	the	central_nervous	system	and	at	SMA	-	relevant	sites	including	motor	neuron	growth	cones	and	neuromuscular	junctions	.	.
s1961	Loss	of	function	mutations	in	human	RNA_splicing_cause	the	rare	disorder	poikiloderma	with	neutropenia_(PN	)	,	and	result	in	U6	snRNAs	with	elongated	3	_	ends	that	are	aberrantly	adenylated	.	.
s2435	TUNEL	assay	was	used	to	detect	the	effect	of	each	group	on	the	apoptosis	of	the	gastric	cancer_cells	,	and	Western	blot	was	used	to	detect	the	expression	of	caspase-3	,	caspase-8	,	bcl-2	,	and	c	-	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	which	are	the	proteins	related	to	apoptosis	,	after	the	drug	effect	in	each	group	.	.
s701	Other	genes	such	as	bile_acid_metabolic_process_and	KIF1C	were	almost	simultaneously	published	as	both	a	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	and	an	ataxia_gene	.	.
s3613	Therefore	,	in	this	study	,	we	examined	the	roles	of	ZMYND10	using	outer_dynein_arm_assembly-/-mice	exhibiting	typical	PCD	phenotypes	,	including	hydrocephalus_and	laterality	defects	.	.
s2002	Mutations	in	the	activation_of_MAPK_activity_gene	,	which	encodes	both	the	cytosolic	and	mitochondrial	isoform	of	lysyl	-	tRNA	synthetase	,	cause	predominantly	neurological	diseases	that	often	involve	deafness	,	but	have	also	been	linked	to	cardiomyopathy	,	developmental_delay_and	lactic	acidosis	.	.
s120	A	third	proband	was	doubly	heterozygous	for	inherited	rare	variants	in	additional	components	of	complex	I	,	cellular_respiration_and	NDUFB9	,	confirming	that	Histiocytoid	CM	is	genetically	heterogeneous	.	.
s2332	This	pathway	is	required	to	maintain	levels	of	GPL	,	especially	phosphatidylethanolamine	(	PE	)	,	as	shown	by	stable	shRNA	-	mediated	silencing	of	pyruvate_metabolic_process	-	M	in	H23	lung	cancer_cells	.	.
s3666	In	the	PPI	network	,	2	clusters	of	VTE	genes	,	including	ribosomal	protein	family	genes	and	NADH	family	-	ubiquinol	-	cytochrome	genes	,	were	identified	,	such	as	ribosomal	protein	L9	(	RPL9	)	,	positive_regulation_of_gene_expression	,	RPS20	,	RPL23	,	and	tumor_protein	p53	(	TP53).The	nod	-	like	receptor	signaling	pathway	,	ribosomal	protein	family	genes	,	such	as	RPL9	,	RPL5	,	RPS20	,	and	RPL23	,	and	DEG	of	TP53	may	have	the	potential	to	be	used	as	targets	for	diagnosis	and	treatment	of	VTE	.
s2767	Our	findings	show	that	GPI_anchor_biosynthetic_process_mutations	may	lead	to	an	isolated	and	mild	limb	girdle	muscular_dystrophy_phenotype	without	cardiomyopathy	.
s2207	Collectively	,	our	findings	identified	LSD1	as	a	novel	negative	regulator	of	autophagy	through	the	regulation_of_cell_growth_signaling	pathway	in	ovarian	cancer_HO8910	cells	and	indicated	that	LSD1	may	function	as	a	driving	factor	of	ovarian	cancer	progression	via	deregulating	autophagy	.
s3330	Our	analyses	revealed	that	the	primary	tumor	and	NCC	-	SS1-C1	cell	line	harbored	the	SS18-regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_fusion	gene	typical	of	synovial	sarcoma_and	similar	proteomics	profiles	.	.
s2684	Five	genes	,	including	sensory_perception_of_sound	,	PLCB4	,	SCEL	,	THSD4	,	and	WWOX	,	have	CNVs	in	the	six	patients	with	sporadic_HBs	,	and	three	genes	,	including	ABCA6	,	CWC27	,	and	LAMA2	,	have	CNVs	in	the	five	patients	with	familial	HBs	.	.
s3633	Moreover	,	expression	of	a	phosphorylation	-	deficient	peptidyl	-	threonine_dephosphorylation_Y94F	mutant	in	cancer_cells	resulted	in	increased	oxidative	phosphorylation	,	decreased	cell	proliferation	under	hypoxia	,	and	reduced	tumor	growth	in	mice	.	.
s615	On	the	other	hand	,	MYH1	,	MYH2	,	MYH3	,	MYH7	,	MYH8	,	FOXO3	,	NFATC1	,	cyclooxygenase_pathway	,	KAT6B	,	HDAC4	,	and	RUNX2	expression	is	suspected	to	be	involved	in	the	epigenetic	regulations	behind	the	mandibular	prognathism_phenotype	.
s3716	In	this	study	,	we	examined	the	potential	for	genetic	susceptibility	to	schizophrenia_of	a	three	-	gene	cluster	region	,	AS3MT	-	magnesium_ion_homeostasis	-	NT5C2	.	.
s2705	The	chromosome	22	disorder	,	due	to	mutations	in	the	nuclear	gene	TYMP	encoding	thymidine	phosphorylase	(	TP	)	,	leads	to	the	accumulation	of	thymidine	and	deoxyuridine	,	with	mitochondrial	dysfunction	.	This	report	describes	a	patient	with	an	pyrimidine_nucleoside_metabolic_process	-	like	syndrome	with	a	heterozygous	TYMP	mutation	who	showed	marked	,	but	transient	improvement	postallogeneic	haematopoietic	stem	cell	transplantation	(	HSCT).The	patient	,	showing	ptosis	and	ophthalmoplegia	,	was	initially	managed	for	myasthenia	gravis	.	.
s2392	Our	data	indicate	that	activation_of_cysteine	-	type_endopeptidase_activity_involved_in_apoptotic_process	,	a	cytokine	mainly	produced	by	blood	endothelial	cells	,	facilitates	tumor_lymphangiogenesis	by	upregulating	VEGFC	expression	in	A549	cells	,	contributing	to	lymphatic	metastasis	in	tumor	-	bearing	mice	.	.
s1661	MSI	-	H	phenotype	and	mismatch_repair_mutation	in	the	colon	cancer_were	confirmed	by	microsatellite	instability	(	MSI	)	PCR	and	next	-	generation	sequencing	(	NGS	)	,	respectively	.	.
s1668	Also	the	well	-	known	gene	variants	rs7903146	in	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	and	rs17817449	in	FTO	,	were	nominally	associated	with	hyperglycemia_(rs7903146	)	,	as	well	as	with	higher	fasting	insulin	levels	(	rs17817449	)	.	.
s154	Yeast	trm7D	mutants	grow	poorly	due	to	lack	of	2	-O	-	methylated	C32	(	Cm32	)	and	Gm34	on	tRNA(Phe	)	,	catalyzed	by	cytoplasmic_translation	-	Trm732	and	Trm7-Trm734	,	respectively	,	which	in	turn	results	in	loss	of	wybutosine	at	G37	.	Mutations	in	human	FTSJ1	,	the	likely	TRM7	homolog	,	cause	nonsyndromic	X	-	linked	intellectual_disability_(NSXLID	)	,	but	the	role	of	FTSJ1	in	tRNA	modification	is	unknown	.	.
s4067	We	also	analyzed	specific	mutations	within	the	12	genes	and	found	that	some	specific	mutations	within	the	MUC12	,	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_and	FOXD4L5	genes	showed	higher	frequencies	in	the	samples	of	FLC	and/or	lung	cancer_tissue	,	compared	with	the	healthy	population	.	.
s1983	We	found	that	histone_methylation_knockout	mice	showed	significantly	lower	expression	of	IL10	and	IL6	cytokines	in	the	liverand	downstream	STAT3	activation	,	which	correlated	with	reduced	number	of	surface	tumors	,	reduced	proliferation	and	reduced	number	of	M2	macrophages	in	the	liver	as	well	as	within	proliferating	nodules	.	.
s2786	Structural	analyses	guided	the	discovery	of	a	broad	,	splicing	-	modulated	interaction	network	between	MDGA	and	NL	family	members	and	helped	rationalize	the	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_of	autism	-	linked	mutations	.	.
s515	Thus	,	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_contributes	to	CRC	tumorigenesis	and	progression	through	the	activation	of	the	AKT	signaling	pathway	.	.
s3889	Increasing	attention	has	been	paid	to	the	roles	of	microRNAs	(	protein_polyubiquitinations	)	in	the	pathogenesis	of	cardiovascular_disease	,	including	miR-1	and	miR-133	(	in	the	electrophysiological	response	)	,	and	miR-34a	(	in	cardiac	fibrosis	)	.	.
s345	In	the	remaining	cases	,	next	generation	sequencing	was	carried	out	revealing	variants	in	a	number	of	other	known	complex	spastic	paraplegia	genes	,	including	five	in	regulation_of_mitochondrial_membrane_permeability_(5/97	)	,	four	in	FA2H	(	also	known	as	SPG35	)	(	4/97	)	and	two	in	ZFYVE26/SPG15	Variants	were	identified	in	genes	usually	associated	with	pure	spastic	paraplegia	and	also	in	the	Parkinson	s	disease	-	associated	gene	ATP13A2	,	neuronal	ceroid	lipofuscinosis	gene	TPP1	and	the	hereditary	motor	and	sensory	neuropathy_DNMT1	gene	,	highlighting	the	genetic	heterogeneity	of	spastic	paraplegia	.	.
s2943	Hence	,	we	focus	on	the	relationship	between	YAP	/	TAZ	and	serine	metabolism	to	control	methylation	of	DNA	or	histone	in	breast	cancer_with	protein_phosphorylation_deficiency	.	.
s10	Furthermore	,	we	demonstrated	that	in	three	different	experimental	models	characterised	by	an	upregulation	of	rRNA	synthesis	,	cancer_cells	treated	with	insulin	or	exposed	to	the	insulin	-	like	growth	factor	1	,	rat	liver	stimulated	by	cortisol	and	regenerating	rat	liver	after	partial	hepatectomy	,	the	p53	protein	level	was	reduced	due	to	a	lowered	ribosomal	protein	availability	for	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_binding	.	.
s2386	We	previously	identified	tumor_necrosis	factor	superfamily	15	(	activation_of_cysteine	-	type_endopeptidase_activity_involved_in_apoptotic_process	)	,	a	blood	vascular	endothelium	-	derived	cytokine	,	in	lymphatic	endothelial	cells	,	as	a	key	molecular	modulator	during	lymphangiogenesis	.	.
s2509	Moreover	,	comparison	of	the	porcine	results	to	those	reported	by	human	melanoma_GWAS	indicated	shared	association	signals	notably	at	CDKAL1	and	TERT	loci	but	also	nearby	CCND1	,	DNA_dealkylation_involved_in_DNA_repair	,	PLA2G6	and	TMEM38B	-	RAD23B	loci	.	.
s2330	pyruvate_metabolic_process	-	M	(	PCK2	)	,	the	mitochondrial	isoform	of	phosphoenolpyruvate	carboxykinase	(	PEPCK	)	,	has	been	shown	by	us	and	others	to	be	functionally	expressed	and	to	mediate	gluconeogenesis	,	the	reverse	pathway	of	glycolysis	,	in	different	cancer_cells	.	.
s3858	Intriguingly	,	five	CPGs	showed	concordance	between	CNL	and	down	-	regulation	in	50	or	more	tumor_samples	,	MTAP	(	216	samples	)	,	PTEN	(	143	)	,	MCPH1	(	86	)	,	SMAD4	(	63	)	,	and	polyphosphate_metabolic_process_(51	)	,	which	may	represent	the	recurrent	driving	force	for	gene	expression	change	during	oncogenesis	.	.
s27	The	novel	aspects	of	this	study	are	the	direct	identification	of	serine	biosynthesis	as	a	critical	mechanism	of	protein_phosphorylation_V600E	inhibitor	resistance	and	the	first	successful	example	of	using	gemcitabine	+	BRAFis	in	combination	to	kill	previously	drug	-	resistant	cancer_cells	,	creating	the	translational	potential	of	pretreatment	with	gemcitabine	prior	to	BRAFi	treatment	of	tumor	cells	to	reverse	resistance	within	the	mutational	profile	and	the	WT	.	.
s137	Surprisingly	,	we	detected	no	ADAM2	,	CALR3	and	snRNA_3'-end_processing_in	the	67	lung	cancers	(	mainly	non	-	small	lung	cancer	)	and	189	breast	cancers	,	while	MAGE	-	A	proteins	were	present	in	15	%	and	7	-	16	%	of	these	tumor_types	,	respectively	.	.
s1779	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	positive_regulation_of_protein_ubiquitination	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s783	Biallelic	mutations	in	the	brain_development_gene	,	encoding	ATPase	family	protein	,	are	an	important	cause	of	newly	recognized	epileptic	encephalopathy_classified	as	epilepsy	,	hearing	loss	,	and	mental	retardation	syndrome	(	EHLMRS	,	OMIM	,	616577	)	.	.
s1085	MAT2A	/	S	-	adenosylmethionine_biosynthetic_process_induction	confers	growth	and	survival	advantage	to	cancerous	cells	,	enhancing	tumor	migration	.	.
s175	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal_recessive_Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	protein_polyubiquitination	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy	(	SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s2024	To	search	for	the	underlying	molecular	mechanism	,	we	turned	to	examine	the	impact	of	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_on	the	expression	of	FBP1	,	a	negative	regulator	of	aerobic	glycolysis	in	pancreatic	cancer_and	indicated	that	CBX3	negatively	regulated	FBP1	expression	.	.
s3518	We	generated	Cc2d1b	knockout	(	KO	)	,	positive_regulation_of_I	-	kappaB_kinase	/	NF	-	kappaB_signaling/1b	double	heterozygous	and	double	KO	mice	,	then	performed	behavioral	studies	to	analyze	learning	and	memory	,	social	interactions	,	anxiety	,	and	hyperactivity	.	.
s1840	This	review	discusses	recurrent	aberrations	in	NKTCL	detected	by	NGS	,	which	can	be	categorized	into	three	main	groups	,	specifically	,	tumor_suppressors	(	TP53	,	DDX3X	,	and	MGA	)	,	the	JAK	/	STAT	cascade	,	and	epigenetic	modifiers	(	response_to_estrogen	,	BCOR	,	ARID1A	,	and	EP300	)	.	.
s494	The	S	-	adenosyl	-	L	-	methionine_transport_gene	encodes	the	mitochondrial	carrier	that	catalyzes	the	import	of	S	-	adenosylmethionine	(	SAM	)	into	the	mitochondrial	matrix	,	required	for	mitochondrial	methylation	processes	,	and	is	down	-	regulated	in	cervical	cancer_cells	.	.
s2034	In	short	,	the	current	study	suggests	XIST	plays	as	an	important	role	in	colon	cancer_progresmelanosome_organizationon	targeted	by	miR-34a	via	Wnt	/	b	-	catenin	signaling	pathway	,	providing	a	novel	insight	for	the	pathogenesis	and	underlying	therapeutic	target	for	colon	cancer	.
s562	Recent	GWAS	completed	for	three	types	of	common	adult	-	onset	glaucoma_have	identified	novel	loci	for	POAG	(	primary	-	open	-	angle	glaucoma	)	(	ABCA1	,	AFAP1	,	GMDS	,	PMM2	,	TGFBR3	,	FNDC3B	,	ARHGEF12	,	GAS7	,	FOXC1	,	ATXN2	,	TXNRD2	)	,	PACG	(	primary	angle	-	closure	glaucoma	(	EPDR1	,	CHAT	,	GLIS3	,	cell	-	matrix_adhesion	,	DPM2-FAM102	)	,	and	exfoliation	syndrome	(	XFS	)	glaucoma	(	CACNA1A	)	.	.
s2017	Here	,	for	the	first	time	,	we	demonstrated	the	roles	of	substrate_adhesion	-	dependent_cell_spreading_in	ovarian_carcinoma_(OC	)	.	.
s711	Ring	finger	protein	6	(	protein_K27-linked_ubiquitination	)	is	a	key	oncogene	in	both	prostate	cancer_and	leukemia	,	but	its	role	is	elusive	in	breast	cancer	.	.
s378	negative_regulation_of_phosphatase_activity_expression	was	closely	related	to	tumor	differentiation	(	P=.039	)	,	tumor	-	node	-	metastasis	stage	(	P=.009	)	,	lymph	node	metastasis	(	P=.038	)	,	and	prognosis	(	P=.043	)	of	lung	cancer	.	.
s2813	We	also	emphasized	that	the	angiogenesis_and	AKT	signaling	pathways	were	the	mechanisms	underlying	the	inhibitory	effect	of	HCRP1	on	glioma_cells	.	.
s3380	Mutations	in	the	KVS	subunit	,	KV8.2	(	potassium_ion_transmembrane_transport	)	,	lead	to	severe	visual_impairment_in	humans	,	but	the	basis	of	these	deficits	remains	unclear	.	.
s1589	In	both	settings	,	PLAG1	transactivates	insulin	-	like	growth	factor	2	(	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation	)	,	a	key	Wilms	tumor_oncogene	,	and	drives	mammalian	target	of	rapamycin	complex	1	(	mTORC1	)	signaling	.	.
s3522	The	subcapsular	cell_adhesion_mediated_by_integrin	-	forming	tumor_was	composed	of	poorly	differentiated	tumor	cells	arranged	in	small	vague	glandular	or	slit	-	lumen	nests	,	and	focally	fused	or	anastomosing	large	trabecular	patterns	within	the	prominent	fibrotic	stroma	.	.
s128	We	used	a	set	of	previously	uncharacterized	antibodies	against	the	cancer	/	testis	antigens	binding_of_sperm_to_zona_pellucida	,	CALR3	and	SAGE1	to	investigate	their	expression	in	a	large	panel	of	normal	tissues	as	well	as	breast	and	lung	cancers	.	.
s2491	Recent	studies	demonstrated	that	glucose_transmembrane_transport_activation	improves	ischemia	-	reperfusion	-	induced	cardiac	injury	,	and	increased	SGLT1	gene	expression	is	observed	in	hypertrophic	,	ischemic	,	and	diabetic	cardiomyopathy_in	human	hearts	.	.
s1466	These	changes	were	accompanied	by	cortical_atrophy_as	well	as	increased	expression	of	angiogenesis	-	related	genes	such	as	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	Serpine1	,	and	Plau	in	CD31-positive	endothelial	cells	.	.
s2761	5	-Aza-2	-deoxycytidine	(	5-Aza	-	neuron_migration	)	is	a	demethylating	drug	that	causes	genome	-	wide	hypomethylation	resulting	in	the	expression	of	several	tumor_suppressor	genes	causing	growth	arrest	of	cancer	cells	.	.
s2472	The	aim	of	the	present	study	is	to	evaluate	protein_acetylation_(cry1	,	cry2	and	per2	)	and	clock	-	controlled	(	vascular	endothelial	growth	factor	-	a	,	early	growth	response	protein	1	and	estrogen	receptor	b	)	gene	expression	in	colorectal	cancer_and	adjacent	tissue	and	identify	a	possible	link	between	survival	of	patients	and	expression	of	above	mentioned	genes	.	.
s2474	The	aim	of	the	present	study	is	to	evaluate	clock	(	cry1	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_and	per2	)	and	clock	-	controlled	(	vascular	endothelial	growth	factor	-	a	,	early	growth	response	protein	1	and	estrogen	receptor	b	)	gene	expression	in	colorectal	cancer_and	adjacent	tissue	and	identify	a	possible	link	between	survival	of	patients	and	expression	of	above	mentioned	genes	.	.
s3740	Since	synaptic_transmission,_cholinergic	-	associated	limb	-	girdle	type	CMS	was	only	manifested	in	AK9	homozygous	variant	carriers	,	the	disease	phenotype	was	of	digenic_inheritance	,	and	was	determined	by	the	novel	disease	modifier	AK9	which	provides	NTPs	for	N	-	glycosylation	.	.
s134	Surprisingly	,	we	detected	no	ADAM2	,	CALR3	and	snRNA_3'-end_processing_in	the	67	lung	cancers	(	mainly	non	-	small	lung	cancer	)	and	189	breast	cancers	,	while	MAGE	-	A	proteins	were	present	in	15	%	and	7	-	16	%	of	these	tumor	types	,	respectively	.	.
s936	These	findings	,	along	with	the	role	of	superoxide_metabolic_process_in	maintaining	self	-	tolerance	,	imply	that	NOX2	is	a	targetable	immune	checkpoint	in	cancer	.	.
s5	A	frame	-	shift	carboxyl	-	terminal	deletion	was	reported	in	microtubule_cytoskeleton_organization_in	an	American	family	with	schizophrenia	,	but	subsequently	found	in	two	controls	.	.
s3168	Bardet	-	Biepositive_regulation_of_I	-	kappaB_kinase	/	NF	-	kappaB_signaling_Syndrome	(	BBS	)	is	a	rare	multi	-	systemic	disease	with	autosomal_recessive_transmission	.	.
s1966	Mutations	in	axon_guidance_in	humans	causes	autosomal	dominant	lateral	temporal	lobe	epilepsy_and	homozygous	deletion	of	LGI1	in	mice	results	in	severe	epileptic	seizures	that	cause	early	postnatal	death	.	.
s3965	Dysfunction	of	the	cerebral	glucose	transporter	GLUT1	(	encoded	by	protein	-	containing_complex_assembly	)	is	known	to	result	in	epilepsy	,	intellectual	disability	(	ID	)	,	and	movement_disorder	.	.
s47	In	severe	bilateral	cases	(	anophthalmia_or	severe	microphthalmia	)	the	genetic	cause	is	now	identifiable	in	approximately	80	percent	of	cases	,	with	de	novo	heterozygous	loss	-	of	-	function	mutations	in	osteoblast_differentiation_or	OTX2	being	the	most	common	.	.
s1011	A	major	implication	of	our	study	is	that	inhibition	of	miR-587	or	restoration	of	PPP2R1B	expression	may	have	significant	therapeutic	potential	to	overcome	drug	resistance	in	colorectal	cancer_patients	and	that	the	combined	use	of	an	AKT	inhibitor	with	5-regulation_of_DNA	-	binding_transcription_factor_activity_may	increase	efficacy	in	colorectal	cancer	treatment	.
s717	In	doxorubicin	-	resistant	breast	cancer_cells	,	RNF6	was	found	to	be	elevated	in	association	with	increased	ERa	and	anti	-	apoptotic	release_of_cytochrome_c_from_mitochondria	,	but	not	pro	-	apoptotic	Bim-1	.	.
s3419	Most	studies	are	in	agreement	as	to	the	belief	that	,	in	a	large	range	of	human	cancers	,	the	negative_regulation_of_cell	-	cell_adhesion_gene	promoter	is	frequently	methylated	,	resulting	in	the	epigenetic	silence	of	this	gene	.	.
s2907	The	present	study	also	identified	in	tumor_and	potentially	malignant	lesions	common	alterations	of	chromosomal	regions	and	genes	,	including	FBXL5	,	UGT2B15	,	steroid_metabolic_process	,	KANSL1	,	GSTT1	and	DUSP22	,	being	some	of	these	typical	aberrations	described	in	oral	cancer	and	others	are	linked	to	chemoradioresistance	.	.
s469	In	this	mini	-	review	,	we	update	the	current	knowledge	for	the	functional	roles	of	negative_regulation_of_Wnt_signaling_pathway_under	physiological	and	pathological	settings	,	and	provide	new	insights	regarding	pS14-WWOX	in	T	leukemia	cell	maturation	,	and	switching	the	anticancer_pY33-WWOX	to	pS14-WWOX	for	cancer	promotion	and	disease	progression	.	.
s2113	Here	we	established	a	mutation	detection	system	based	on	multiple	fluorescent	probe	technique	,	which	can	detect	and	genotype	nine	hotspot	mutations	of	four	prominent	hearing_loss	-	related	genes	in	two	reactions	on	a	four	-	channel	real	-	time	PCR	instrument	,	including	GJB2	(	rs750188782	,	rs80338943	,	rs1110333204	,	and	rs80338939	)	,	in_utero_embryonic_development_(rs74315319	)	,	SLC26A4	(	rs111033313	and	rs121908362	)	,	and	mtDNA	12S	rRNA	(	rs267606617	and	rs267606619	)	.	.
s1603	Consistent	with	this	result	,	mutations	in	the	learning_gene	coding	for	CASPR2	in	human	have	been	identified	in	neurodevelopmental	disorders	such	as	autism	,	intellectual	disability	,	and	epilepsy	.	.
s398	3-Methylglutaconic	aciduria	is	associated	with	variants	in	genes	encoding	mitochondrial_inner	membrane	organizing	determinants	,	including	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation	,	DNAJC19	,	SERAC1	and	QIL1/MIC13	.
s1159	We	present	detailed	phenotypic	information	on	seven	unrelated	individuals	with	a	recurrent	de	novo	nonsense	variant	(	c.2737CAAAAT	[	p	.	Arg913Ter	]	)	in	the	penultimate	exon	of	regulation_of_axon_guidance_who	have	severe	-	profound	intellectual_disability_and	additional	central	and	peripheral	nervous	system	symptoms	but	an	absence	of	frontonasal	or	limb	malformations	.	.
s2981	In	humans	,	mutations	in	the	NMD	factor	gene	,	nuclear	-	transcribed_mRNA_catabolic_process,_nonsense	-	mediated_decay	,	cause	intellectual	disability	(	ID	)	and	are	strongly	associated	with	autism_spectrum	disorder	(	ASD	)	,	attention	deficit	hyperactivity	disorder	(	ADHD	)	and	schizophrenia	(	SCZ	)	.	.
s1865	Several	independent	research	groups	,	including	our	own	,	recently	examined	the	effects	of	heterozygous	deletion	of	chromatin	-	mediated_maintenance_of_transcription_in	mice	and	reported	severe	behavioral	abnormalities	reminiscent	of	autism_spectrum	disorders	and	intellectual	disability	as	well	as	marked	changes	in	gene	expression	and	decreased	body	size	.	.
s2068	This	review	summarizes	the	current	knowledge	of	tumorigenesis	and	tumor	progression	in	early	lung	adenocarcinoma	,	with	special	focus	on	its	clinicopathological	characteristics	and	their	associations	with	driver	mutations	(	EGFR	,	KRAS	,	and	protein_phosphorylation	)	as	well	as	on	its	molecular	pathogenesis	and	progression	.
s2420	Finally	,	both	genetic	and	pharmacological	inactivation	of	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_in	muscle	progenitor	cells	afforded	substantial	protection	against	cancer	-	mediated	cachexia	,	which	translated	into	meaningful	survival	benefits	,	implicating	Twist1	as	a	possible	target	for	attenuating	muscle	cachexia	in	cancer	patients	.
s3331	Our	analyses	revealed	that	the	primary	tumor_and	NCC	-	SS1-negative_regulation_of_cell_migration_cell	line	harbored	the	SS18-SSX1	fusion	gene	typical	of	synovial	sarcoma	and	similar	proteomics	profiles	.	.
s1920	Immune	checkpoint	blockade	(	ICB	)	using	anti	-	negative_regulation_of_regulatory_T_cell_differentiation_and	anti	-	PD1	has	drawn	considerable	attention	towards	co	-	signaling	receptors	in	tumor_immunology	and	created	renewed	interest	in	studying	other	co	-	signaling	receptors	,	which	until	recently	have	not	been	as	well	studied	.	.
s1247	Improvements	in	our	understanding	of	the	molecular	subtypes	of	gliomas	and	the	underlying	alterations	in	specific	signaling	pathways	may	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_both	the	diagnosis	and	the	treatment	strategies	for	patients	with	gliomas	.	.
s3776	The	findings	of	the	present	study	suggest	that	establishment_of_epithelial_cell_polarity_expression	correlates	with	the	development	of	tongue	squamous_cell_carcinoma	.	.
s2085	In	this	study	,	we	investigated	the	anti	-	tumor_response	of	combining	IL	PV-10	with	blockade	of	the	PD-1	/	immune_response_pathway	and	the	role	of	immune	cell	populations	in	eliciting	this	response	.	.
s3350	PCP	signalling	disruption	caused	by	establishment_of_planar_polarity_(Vangl2Lp/+	)	or	Celsr1	(	Celsr1Crsh/+	)	mutations	significantly	reduced	trabecular	bone	mass	and	distal_tibial	cortical	thickness	.	.
s2394	Longer	population	doubling	time	in	L	-	transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_IIs	was	not	related	to	the	AML	characteristics	at	diagnosis	(	French	-	American	-	British	type	,	cytogenetics	,	or	tumor_burden	)	,	but	was	related	to	patient	age	and	independently	associated	with	poorer	patient	outcome	,	as	was	cytogenetic	prognostic	feature	.	.
s869	Metabolic	cutis	laxa	results	from	Menkes	syndrome	,	caused	by	a	defect	in	the	ATPase	copper	transporting	alpha	(	ATP7A	)	gene	,	congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	due	to	mutations	in	subunit	7	of	the	component	of	oligomeric	Golgi	(	COG7)-congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	(	CDG	)	complex	,	combined	disorder	of	N-	and	O	-	linked	glycosylation	,	due	to	mutations	in	ATPase	H+	transporting	V0	subunit	a2	(	ATP6VOA2	)	gene	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	reductase	1	deficiency	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	synthase	deficiency	,	macrocephaly	,	alopecia	,	cutis	laxa	,	and	scoliosis_(MACS	)	syndrome	,	due	to	Ras	and	Rab	interactor	2	(	RIN2	)	mutations	,	transaldolase	deficiency	caused	by	mutations	in	the	transaldolase	1	(	TALDO1	)	gene	,	Gerodermia	osteodysplastica	due	to	mutations	in	the	golgin	,	RAB6-interacting	(	GORAB	or	SCYL1BP1	)	gene	,	and	mitogen	-	activated	pathway	(	MAP	)	kinase	defects	,	caused	by	mutations	in	several	genes	[	protein	tyrosine	phosphatase	,	non	-	receptor	-	type	11	(	PTPN11	)	,	RAF	,	NF	,	regulation_of_neurotransmitter_receptor_localization_to_postsynaptic_specialization_membrane_proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	HRAS	)	,	B	-	Raf	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	BRAF	)	,	MEK1/2	,	KRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	KRAS	)	,	SOS	Ras	/	Rho	guanine	nucleotide	exchange	factor	2	(	SOS2	)	,	leucine	rich	repeat	scaffold	protein	(	SHOC2	)	,	NRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	NRAS	)	,	and	Raf-1	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	RAF1	)	]	,	which	regulate	the	Ras	-	MAPK	cascade	.	.
s2263	In	the	following	review	,	we	present	background	theories	on	the	ER(-)/positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II(+	)	breast	cancer_origin	and	their	epidemiological	and	clinicopathological	characteristics	,	including	the	predictive	and	prognostic	significance	of	these	rare	tumors	.
s2885	Our	results	suggest	that	biological_process_mutations	(	absent	in	500	early	-	onset	patients	with	Parkinson	s	disease	)	rarely	cause	dopa	-	responsive	nonprogressive_parkinsonism	in	adulthood	,	but	broaden	the	clinical	spectrum	of	DNAJC12	deficiency	.	.
s2842	In	conclusion	,	our	study	demonstrates	for	the	first	time	that	DNA_strand_renaturationR2	protein	is	overexpressed	in	early	-	stage	cervical	cancer_and	unravels	some	unconventional	oncogenic	functions	of	p53R2	.	p53R2	may	be	a	useful	prognostic	biomarker	and	therapeutic	target	for	cervical	cancer	.
s1189	Additionally	,	the	SNP	of	rs57095329	showed	statistical	significances	with	the	appearances	of	mutism_and	the	positive	of	cerebrospinal	fluid	(	CSF	)	protein	14	-	3	-	3	in	sCJD	patients	,	while	the	SNP	of	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	-	RASA2	was	significantly	related	with	the	appearance	of	myoclonus	in	sCJD	patients	.	.
s2071	Five	of	the	fifteen	sarcosine_catabolic_process	-	deficient	GISTs	had	follow	-	up	data	,	one	patient	died	8	months	after	surgery	from	unknown	cause	,	four	had	no	recurrences	or	metastases	,	and	there	was	no	history	of	paraganglioma_and	pulmonary	chondroma	found	in	patients	and	their	families	.	.
s508	Here	,	we	report	that	the	expression	of	the	nervous_system_development_gene	is	aberrantly	elevated	in	human	basal_cell_carcinoma_(BCC	)	,	coinciding	with	increased	primary	cilia	formation	and	activated	hedgehog	(	Hh	)	signaling	.	.
s33	With	a	combination	of	whole	-	genome	mapping	and	exome	sequencing	,	we	identified	three	mutations	in	endoplasmic_reticulum_tubular_network_organization_in	two	families	with	HSP	,	a	missense	variant	(	c.107TAAAAA	[	p	.	Val36Glu	]	)	that	segregated	in	the	heterozygous	state	in	a	family	with	autosomal	-	dominant	inheritance_and	a	missense	change	(	c.215TAAAAA	[	p	.	Phe72Tyr	]	)	that	segregated	in	trans	with	a	splice	site	mutation	(	c.105	+	3GAAAAT	)	in	a	family	with	autosomal	-	recessive	transmission	.	.
s2314	They	affect	AQP2	,	carbon_dioxide_transport_and	AQP8	,	where	they	are	associated	with	nephrogenic	diabetes	insipidus	,	keratoderma	and	colorectal	cancer	,	respectively	.	.
s803	In	the	present	study	,	we	performed	three	-	dimensional	fluorescence	in	situ	hybridization	experiments	in	the	colorectal	cancer_cell	lines	histone_succinylation-1	and	LoVo	using	whole	chromosome	painting	probes	for	chromosomes	8	and	11	and	BAC	clones	targeting	four	genes	with	different	expression	levels	assessed	by	gene	expression	arrays	and	RT	-	PCR	.	.
s3526	After	exclusive	analysis	of	10	common	variations	of	three	hearing_loss	-	related	genes	,	GJB2	,	mtDNA12srRNA	and	regulation_of_pH	,	a	novel	truncated	variant	of	SMPX	,	c.87dupA	(	p	.	Gly30Argfs	12	)	(	NCBI	ClinVar	Submission	ID	,	SUB3136126	)	,	was	identified	by	whole	-	exome	sequencing	.	.
s2590	Genetic	studies	on	consanguineous	families	with	primary	microcephaly_have	identified	15	(	MCPH	)	causative	genes	that	include	MCPH1	,	WDR62	,	CDK5RAP2	,	CASC5	,	ASPM	,	CENPJ	,	STIL	,	CEP135	,	CEP152	,	ZNF335	,	histone_ubiquitination	,	CDK6	,	CENPE	,	SASS6	MFSD2A	ANKLE2	and	CIT	(	Khan	et	al	.	2014	,	Yamamoto	et	al	.	2014	,	Alakbarzade	et	al	.	2015,Morris	-	Rosendahl	and	Kaindl	2015	,	Basit	et	al	.	2016	)	.	.
s2453	Methods	,	Fourteen	haplotype	-	tagging	single	nucleotide	polymorphisms	(	htSNPs	)	of	MLH1	,	MLH3	and	DNA_repair_genes	were	genotyped	by	Sequenom	MassARRAY	method	in	146	patients	with	locally	advanced	rectal	cancer_who	received	preoperative	chemoradiotherapy	.	.
s3697	In	negative_regulation_of_peptidase_activity	-	positive	tumor	samples	,	CSTA	-	expressing	cancer_cells	often	expressed	Ki67	,	a	proliferation	marker	,	which	was	in	sharp	contrast	to	normal	mucosa	,	where	Ki67-expressing	cells	were	limited	to	the	basal	layer	and	did	not	express	CSTA	.	.
s1597	In	this	review	,	we	introduce	the	current	knowledge	of	miRNA	functions	in	cancer_development	and	discuss	the	clinical	applications	of	protein_glycosylation	-	miRNAs	,	eg	,	as	diagnostic	markers	and	therapeutic	targets	.
s1299	Here	,	we	presented	an	X	-	fatty_acid_beta	-	oxidation_case	of	a	46-year	-	old	Asian	male	with	severe	autonomic_dysfunction	.	.
s2031	Disrupting	the	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	-	FBP1	signaling	axis	would	be	effective	to	treat	pancreatic	cancer_and	prevent	aerobic	glycolysis	.
s2892	Top	10	genes	in	the	brown	module	,	including	angiogenesis_containing	fibulin	like	extracellular	matrix	protein	2	(	EFEMP2	)	,	fibrillin	1	(	FBN1	)	and	secreted	protein	acidic	and	cysteine	rich	(	SPARC	)	were	also	associated	with	survival	time	of	colon	cancer_patients	.	.
s2262	One	of	the	most	extensively	propagated	hypotheses	trying	to	explain	the	origin	of	ER(-)/positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II(+	)	breast	cancers	claims	that	they	are	technical	artifacts	dependent	on	the	immunohistochemical	procedure	.	.
s993	First	,	a	novel	variation	c.460	-	650AAAAAG	was	found	in	our	study	which	might	cause	premature	termination	of	splicing	of	the	conserved	domain	in	rRNA_processing	,	second	,	c.1494	+	1111GAAAAT	(	rs13178997	)	had	significantly	different	frequency	in	our	JOAG	patients	compared	to	the	reference	frequency	on	NCBI	,	third	,	a	variation	c.710	+	30CAAAAT	(	rs10038177	)	was	found	in	our	study	,	which	had	already	been	reported	to	be	related	to	high	-	pressure	glaucoma	.	.
s194	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal	recessive	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/positive_regulation_of_cell_aging	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy_(SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s2941	Two	pairwise	genetic	interactions	(	B	cell	lymphocyte	kinase	(	BLK	)	rs13277113,B	cell	scaffold	protein	with	ankyrin	repeats	1	(	BANK1	)	rs3733197and	BLK	rs13277113	membrane	metalloendopeptidase	like	1	(	proteolysis)/	tumor_necrosis	factor	receptor	superfamily	member	14	(	TNFRSF14	)	rs3890745	)	have	been	demonstrated	in	determining	susceptibility	to	rheumatoid	arthritis	(	RA	)	without	replication	,	thus	this	study	was	performed	to	examine	whether	abovementioned	genetic	polymorphisms	were	associated	with	RA	and	further	tests	were	performed	to	see	whether	aforementioned	genetic	interactions	existed	in	RA	among	Chinese	population	.	.
s907	Moreover	,	we	observed	that	well	-	differentiated	RT-112	and	de	-	differentiated	regulation_of_integrin_activation-29	bladder	cancer_cells	show	an	inverse	expression	of	tricellulin	and	Itch	.	.
s3745	The	most	significantly	mutated	CMG	is	heart_looping_with	biallelic	inactivation	and	loss	of	DNAAF1	expression	shown	in	tumours	from	carriers	.	.
s2494	CHD	proteins	play	an	important	role	in	neurodevelopment	,	as	pathogenic	variants	in	CHD1	,	CHD2	,	ATP	-	dependent_chromatin_remodeling	,	CHD7	and	CHD8	have	been	associated	with	a	range	of	neurological	phenotypes	,	including	autism_spectrum	disorder	(	ASD	)	,	intellectual	disability	(	ID	)	and	epilepsy	.	.
s1912	To	explore	the	relationship	between	mouse	double	minute	2	binding	protein	(	protein_localization_to_kinetochore	)	and	the	prognosis	of	cancer	patients	,	a	databank	-	based	reanalysis	was	conducted	and	a	clinical	observation	about	lung_adenocarcinoma_was	taken	to	verify	the	result	of	data	analysis	.	We	reanalyzed	all	the	downloaded	data	in	order	to	make	a	conclusion	about	the	relationship	between	MTBP	and	the	prognosis	of	cancer	patients	.	.
s2090	Moreover	,	the	expression	levels	of	these	miRNAs	were	downregulated	in	cancer_cells	that	had	originated	from	these	tissues	,	resulting	in	programmed_cell_death2	dominance	.	.
s2492	CHD	proteins	play	an	important	role	in	neurodevelopment	,	as	pathogenic	variants	in	covalent_chromatin_modification	,	CHD2	,	CHD4	,	CHD7	and	CHD8	have	been	associated	with	a	range	of	neurological	phenotypes	,	including	autism_spectrum	disorder	(	ASD	)	,	intellectual	disability	(	ID	)	and	epilepsy	.	.
s264	Recently	,	biological_process_is	supposed	to	be	of	great	value	for	the	discoveries	of	anti	-	tumor_drugs	.	.
s2159	We	report	the	case	of	a	45	year	old	woman	diagnosed	with	bile_acid_biosynthetic_process	-	related	cerebellar	ataxia	.	.
s1199	In	particular	,	MYH9	mutations	result	in	congenital	macrothrombocytopenia	and	predispose	to	kidney	failure	,	hearing_loss	,	and	cataracts	,	cell_surface_receptor_signaling_pathway_and	MECOM	mutations	cause	congenital	thrombocytopenia	evolving	into	bone	marrow	failure	,	whereas	thrombocytopenias	caused	by	RUNX1	,	ANKRD26	,	and	ETV6	mutations	are	characterized	by	predisposition	to	hematological	malignancies	.	.
s1758	In	addition	,	several	studies	have	demonstrated	that	detection_of_calcium_ion_dysfunction	may	be	associated	with	some	fatal	vascular	diseases	,	such	as	pulmonary	arterial	hypertension	,	primary	hypertension	,	diabetes	,	acute	myocardial_infarction_and	vascular	calcification	.	.
s2164	This	validation	revealed	that	the	expression	of	FREM2AAAAAmdash	,	but	not	epithelial_to_mesenchymal_transition_involved_in_cardiac_fibroblast_developmentAAAAAmdash	,	is	higher	in	glioblastoma_cell	lines	when	compared	to	non	-	malignant	astrocytes	.	.
s2557	Expectedly	,	the	analysis	of	the	DEGs	common	to	all	three	alterations	highlighted	a	group	of	BioFunctions	that	included	Cell	Proliferation	of	tumor_cell	lines	(	14	DEGs	)	,	Invasion	of	cells	(	10	DEGs	)	and	Migration	of	tumour	cell	lines	(	10	DEGs	)	,	with	a	common	core	of	5	genes	(	ATF3	,	CDKN1A	,	GDF15	,	HBEGF	and	defense_response_to_bacterium	)	that	likely	represent	downstream	effectors	of	the	pro	-	oncogenic	activities	of	PI3K	/	AKT	signalling	.	.
s3523	The	tumor_cells	with	immunoreactivity	to	CK7	,	CK19	,	Cam5.2	,	COX2	,	EMA	,	BCL-2	,	MOC-31	and	anion_transport	/	AE3	,	supported	a	diagnosis	of	intrahepatic	cholangiocarcinoma	.	.
s2689	Five	genes	,	including	OTOGL	,	PLCB4	,	SCEL	,	THSD4	,	and	WWOX	,	have	CNVs	in	the	six	patients	with	sporadic_HBs	,	and	three	genes	,	including	ABCA6	,	protein_peptidyl	-	prolyl_isomerization	,	and	LAMA2	,	have	CNVs	in	the	five	patients	with	familial	HBs	.	.
s2381	The	goal	of	this	study	was	to	isolate	cancer	stem	-	like	cells	marked	by	high	expression	of	hyaluronan_catabolic_process	,	a	putative	cancer	stem	cell	marker	,	from	primary	oral	squamous	cell	carcinomas	and	identify	distinctive	gene	expression	patterns	in	these	cells	.	.
s2411	Neurotrophins	and	their	receptors	might	regulate	cell	survival	in	head	and	neck	squamous_cell_carcinoma_(HNSCC	)	.	mRNA	expression	of	nerve	growth	factor	(	NGF	)	and	protein	synthesis	of	high	(	protein_phosphorylation	)	and	low	affinity	neurotrophin	(	p75	neurotrophin	receptor	,	NTR	)	receptors	were	investigated	in	normal	oral	mucosa	and	in	HNSCC	.	.
s3669	In	this	study	,	we	investigated	the	functional	significance	of	the	expansion	of	myeloid	-	derived	suppressor	cell	(	MDSC)-like	CD11b+Gr-1	+	cells	in	response	to	the	macrolide	antibiotic	clarithromycin	(	negative_regulation_of_endothelial_cell_proliferation	)	in	mouse	models	of	shock	and	post	-	influenza	pneumococcal	pneumonia_as	well	as	in	humans	.	.
s3283	Furthermore	,	these	in	vitro	findings	were	validated	in	vivo	and	the	protein_phosphorylation/2	and	PI3k	/	AKT	signaling	pathways	were	involved	in	PSMB8-triggered	migration	and	proliferation	of	glioma_cells	.	.
s66	The	created	databases	include	ACAD8	(	isobutyryl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	deficiency	(	IBD	)	)	,	ACADSB	(	short	-	chain	acyl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	(	SCAD	)	deficiency	)	,	AUH	(	3-methylglutaconic	aciduria	(	3-MGCA	)	)	,	cholesterol_biosynthetic_process_(Smith	-	Lemli	-	Opitz	syndrome	)	,	HMGCS2	(	3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl	-	CoA	synthase	2	deficiency	)	,	HSD17B10	(	17-beta	-	hydroxysteroid	dehydrogenase	X	deficiency	)	,	FKBP14	(	Ehlers	-	Danlos	syndrome	with	progressive	kyphoscoliosis	,	myopathy	,	and	hearing_loss	,	EDSKMH	)	and	ROGDI	(	Kohlschutter	-	Tonz	syndrome	)	.	.
s1077	Patients	who	carry	the	collagen	type	IVA3	chain	(	COL4A3	)	or	glomerular_basement_membrane_development_mutations	usually	exhibit	Alport	Syndrome	(	AS	)	,	thin	basement	membrane	neuropathy_or	familial	hematuria	(	FH	)	.	.
s1968	RhoA	activity	is	significantly	increased	in	cortical	cultures	derived	from	axon_guidance_null	mice	and	using	a	reconstituted	system	,	we	show	directly	that	LGI1	antagonizes	NgR1-tumor_necrosis	factor	receptor	orphan	Y	(	TROY	)	signaling	.	.
s2105	We	suggest	that	the	combination	of	reduced	NM23-negative_regulation_of_cell_migration	,	induced	MACC1	,	and	the	presence	of	tumor	budding	are	promising	biomarkers	for	the	prediction	of	recurrence	and	may	aid	the	stratification	of	patients	with	stage	II	colon	cancer_for	adjuvant	chemotherapy	.
s3826	We	generated	tumor_xenografts	of	SQCC	cell	lines	and	examined	the	consequences	of	targeting	phosphatidylinositol_3-kinase_signaling_expression	.	.
s4012	Currently	,	21	genes	(	retina_homeostasis-21	)	present	on	different	chromosomes	have	been	mapped	,	these	genes	are	responsible	for	BBS	phenotypes	and	they	show	a	great	heterogeneity_of	mutations	.	The	most	common	genes	are	BBS1	(	locus	11q13	)	and	BBS10.We	show	here	the	case	of	a	50	year	old	patient	with	BBS	.	.
s970	We	report	a	sibling	pair	with	FTHS	caused	by	a	homozygous	,	novel	mutation	pLys133Glnfs	13	in	the	superoxide_metabolic_process_gene	,	one	sibling	had	bilateral	ocular	hypertension	and	unilateral	colobomas	of	iris	,	choroid	and	retina	,	the	other	,	unilateral	myelinated	nerve	fiber	layer	of	the	optic	disk	and	papilledema	due	to	idiopathic	intracranial_hypertension	.	.
s1334	Both	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	antitumor_results	demonstrated	that	the	sustained	-	release	PTX	could	induce	the	microtubules	assembly	and	the	over	-	expression	of	B_cell_apoptotic_process_and	Cyclin	B1	proteins	,	resulting	in	the	microtubule	dynamics	disruption	,	G2/M	phase	arrest	,	and	cell	apoptosis	accordingly	.	.
s1465	Thus	,	our	study	considerably	extends	the	picture	of	pathways	involved	in	molecular	pathogenesis	of	T	-	PLL	and	identifies	the	tumor_suppressor	gene	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination_with	~20	%	of	T	-	PLL	affected	by	destructive	lesions	likely	as	major	player	in	T	-	PLL	pathogenesis	.
s1773	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	protein_phosphorylation	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s1286	t(12,22)(p13,q12	)	is	a	rare	but	recurrent	chromosomal	abnormality	involving	the	ETS	transcription	factor	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_and	meningioma_1	(	MN1	)	genes	.	.
s1975	Cerebrospinal	fluid	of	20	non	-	tumor_patients	served	as	controls	.	Mean	levels	of	cell	-	matrix_adhesion_in	tumor	cyst	fluid	were	significantly	higher	in	glioblastoma	(	6118	+	4095	ng	/	mL	)	and	metastasis	patients	(	8001	+	6535	ng	/	mL	)	than	in	CSF	of	control	patients	(	714	+	22	ng	/	mL	)	.	.
s1518	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	B_cell_receptor_signaling_pathway	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s1922	This	is	an	original	cell_junction_assembly_mutation	in	a	MFM	family	with	an	atypical	clinical	and	histopathological	presentation	,	given	the	presence	of	significantly	focal	lesions	and	prominent	sarcoplasmic	masses	in	muscle	biopsies	and	the	constant	heart	involvement	preceding	significantly	the	onset	of	the	myopathy	.	.
s527	Knockdown	of	SRP72	resulted	in	significant	radiosensitization	of	HeLa	(	cervical	)	,	PSN-1	(	pancreatic	)	,	and	T24	(	bladder	)	,	regulation_of_immune_response-549	(	breast	)	and	MCF7	(	breast	)	tumor_lines	as	measured	by	colony	formation	assays	.	.
s1884	Intriguingly	,	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination_is	highly	expressed	and	predicts	bad	prognosis	in	MYCN	-	amplified	neuroblastoma	.	.
s3602	Our	data	suggest	a	mechanism	whereby	CAFs	promote	tumor_cell	migration	and	invasion	through	integrin_activation_secretion	to	regulate	the	mDia2-directed	cytoskeleton	in	breast	tumor	cells	.
s108	We	validated	ZBTB20	,	CELF2	,	protein_targeting_to_membrane	,	AKAP13	and	WAC	,	which	were	identified	by	our	screens	in	multiple	cancer	types	,	as	new	tumor_suppressor	genes	in	prostate	cancer	.	.
s3861	In	A549	lung	cancer_cells	,	which	endogenously	express	cell_surface_receptor_signaling_pathway	,	the	depletion	of	REEP5	and	REEP6	significantly	reduced	growth	and	invasion	by	downregulating	IL-8-stimulated	ERK	phosphorylation	,	actin	polymerization	and	the	expression	of	genes	related	to	metastasis	.	.
s2299	Low	signal_transduction_expression	typified	hyperproliferative	tumors	,	and	loss	of	taurine	signaling	correlated	with	reduced	patient	survival	,	suggesting	this	tumor	suppressive	mechanism	operates	in	vivo	.
s2273	Reduced	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_expression	promoted	the	proliferation	and	invasion	of	glioma_cells	,	and	inhibited	their	apoptosis	in	vitro	,	and	the	downregulation	of	HOXB1	was	also	associated	with	worse	survival	in	glioma	patients	.	.
s1390	Heterogeneous	HS	distribution	in	the	HS	-	positive	tumours	was	more	related	to	the	necrosis	or	glandular	-	like	brain	zones	rather	than	glioma	cells	with	high	or	low	regulation_of_proteasomal_protein_catabolic_process-67	index	.	.
s665	In	addition	,	differences	in	pathology	of	the	kidneys	from	intraciliary_retrograde_transport_mutations	may	result	in	heterogeneous_features	in	renal	ultrasound	findings	.	.
s3201	However	,	more	recently	,	inherited	chromatin_remodeling	/	SNF	-	deficiency	has	been	linked	to	several	benign	syndromic	tumors	including	a	subset	of	familial	schwannomatosis	(	linked	to	SMARCB1	)	and	multiple	meningiomas	(	linked	to	SMARCE1	)	as	well	as	others	.	.
s165	This	paper	shows	the	significant	difference	in	distribution	of	visual_perception_promoter	(	G(-47)--AAAAA	)	genotypes	in	patients	with	cataract_compared	to	the	control	group	.	.
s2130	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	inner_dynein_arm_assembly	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s2627	Although	no	overt	changes	in	corneal_opacity_were	detected	by	slit	-	regulation_of_autophagy_examination	,	the	corneas	of	homozygous	mutant	mice	exhibited	histological	and	ultrastructural	epithelial	cell	fragility	phenotypes	.	.
s3230	Therefore	,	STX3	promotes	the	growth	of	breast	cancer_cells	by	regulating	the	PTEN	-	PI3K	-	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	-	mTOR	signaling	.
s1939	Blocking	the	expression	of	integrin	a2b1	,	which	was	accomplished	by	transduction	of	a2-specific	shRNA	,	resulted	in	significant	inhibition	of	proliferation	and	clonal	activity	in	human	MCF-7	breast_carcinoma_and	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	-	Mel-147	melanoma	cells	.	.
s2233	The	musculo	-	aponeurotic	fibrosarcoma_oncogene	homolog	B	(	negative_regulation_of_erythrocyte_differentiation	)	significantly	enhanced	the	activation	of	the	TFPI2	promoter	via	RARAAAAAalpha	,	while	MAFF	inhibited	it	.	.
s3962	Exome	and	targeted	sequencing	has	recently	identified	four	new	genes	causing	ataxia	,	TGM6	,	cation_transport	,	SYT14	,	and	rundataxin	.	.
s3376	Chronic	l	-	DOPA	treatment	that	induces	dyskinesia_selectively	restores	spine	density	and	excitability	in	indirect	pathway	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_IIs	(	iSPNs	)	,	whereas	spine	loss	and	hyperexcitability	persist	in	direct	pathway	SPNs	(	dSPNs	)	.	.
s3747	In	our	patient	cohort	,	causative	variants	in	GJB2	,	USH2A	,	MYO15A	and	STRC	,	and	in	MYO6	were	the	leading	causes	for	autosomal_recessive_and	dominant	potassium_ion_transport	,	respectively	.	.
s2305	Both	the	primary	tumor_and	the	JU	-	PI	cells	showed	nuclear	expression	of	the	positive_regulation_of_cell_adhesion_transcription	factor	but	TFE3-activating	chromosomal	rearrangements	were	not	found	.	.
s2794	The	PCH1sub	-	types	with	early	death	(	between	ages	1	day	and	17	months	)	,	seen	in	patients	with	p	.	G31A	/	rRNA_processing_or	SLC25A46	mutations	have	a	SMA	type	1-like	clinical	presentation	but	with	global	developmental_delay	,	visual	and	hearing	impairment	,	with	or	without	microcephaly	,	nystagmus	and	optic	atrophy	.	.
s2242	In	lung_adenocarcinoma_(LADC	)	,	specific	thyroxin	kinase	inhibitors	against	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_mutations	and	ALK	fusions	are	used	as	a	standard	treatment	regimen	and	show	significant	positive	efficacy	.	.
s1798	Furthermore	,	we	identified	differential	activation_of_MAPKK_activity	-	tr	expression	in	breast	cancer_cell	lines	and	showed	that	breast	cancer	cells	with	increased	Raf1-tr	expression	become	sensitized	to	bleomycin	-	induced	apoptosis	.	.
s2677	Genes	harboring	the	most	significant	mutations	include	cell_adhesion	,	KLHL12	,	DCAF4L1	,	and	VHL	in	sporadic_HBs	,	and	ZNF814	,	DLG2	,	RIMS1	,	PNN	,	and	MUC7	in	familial	HBs	.	.
s1532	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	memory	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s2621	Mutations	in	the	immunoglobulin	superfamily	,	member	1	gene	(	IGSF1/regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	)	cause	an	X	-	linked	form	of	central	hypothyroidism	.	.
s3830	In	tumors	with	high	PIK3R2	expression	,	and	independently	of	phosphorylation	,	KRAS	,	or	PTEN	mutations	,	PIK3R2	depletion	induced	lung	SQCC	xenograft	regression	without	triggering	PI3K	/	AKT	pathway	rebound	.	.
s1043	Additionally	,	the	previously	reported	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_neuroblastoma_risk	locus	was	statistically	significant	only	in	patients	with	MYCN	-	nonamplified	high	-	risk	tumors	(	OR	=	0.63	,	95	%	CI	=	0.53	to	0.75	,	Pmeta	=	1.51	x	10	-	8	,	Pmeta	=	.95	)	.	.
s1461	Higher	pre	-	citrate_transport_nuclear	Prx	I	expression	predicted	smaller	size	of	a	resected	tumor_(p	=	0.00052	,	r	=	-0.550	)	,	and	higher	pre	-	NACT	cytoplasmic	Prx	I	expression	predicted	a	lower	amount	of	evacuated	nodal	metastasis	(	p	=	0.0024	,	r	=	-0.472	)	.	.
s402	Here	,	we	report	mutations	in	dopamine_receptor_signaling_pathway_that	are	associated	with	heart	-	rate	disturbance	,	eye	disease	,	intellectual	disability	,	gastric	problems	,	hypotonia	,	and	seizures_in	nine	individuals	from	six	families	.	.
s333	We	identified	a	homozygous	missense	mutation	,	c.1308	G	-	A	(	p	.	V421	M	)	in	mitochondrial_respiratory_chain_complex_I_assembly_in	a	patient	who	presented	with	epilepsy	and	severe_psychomotor	retardation	.	.
s182	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal_recessive_Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy	(	SPG7/PGN	,	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination	/	ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s553	Recent	GWAS	completed	for	three	types	of	common	adult	-	onset	glaucoma_have	identified	novel	loci	for	POAG	(	primary	-	open	-	angle	glaucoma	)	(	ABCA1	,	AFAP1	,	GMDS	,	PMM2	,	epithelial_to_mesenchymal_transition	,	FNDC3B	,	ARHGEF12	,	GAS7	,	FOXC1	,	ATXN2	,	TXNRD2	)	,	PACG	(	primary	angle	-	closure	glaucoma	(	EPDR1	,	CHAT	,	GLIS3	,	FERMT2	,	DPM2-FAM102	)	,	and	exfoliation	syndrome	(	XFS	)	glaucoma	(	CACNA1A	)	.	.
s138	Treatment	with	DNA	methyltransferase	inhibitors	has	been	proposed	as	an	attractive	strategy	to	increase	the	expression	of	cancer	/	testis	antigens	in	tumors	before	immunotargeting	,	however	,	neither	binding_of_sperm_to_zona_pellucida	,	CALR3	nor	SAGE1	could	be	significantly	induced	in	lung	and	breast	cancer	cell	lines	using	this	strategy	.	.
s2483	Our	data	indicate	sex	-	dependent	associations	between	protein_acetylation_and	clock	-	controlled	gene	expression	in	cancer_tissue	and	patient	s	survival	prognosis	.
s2620	Mutations	in	the	immunoglobulin	superfamily	,	member	1	gene	(	regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	/	Igsf1	)	cause	an	X	-	linked	form	of	central	hypothyroidism	.	.
s1898	Heterozygous	de	novo	NALCN	missense	variants	in	the	translation	/	S6	pore	-	forming	segments	lead	to	congenital	contractures	of	the	limbs	and	face	,	hypotonia	,	and	developmental_delay_(CLIFAHDD	,	OMIM	616266	)	with	some	clinical	overlap	.	.
s2605	Oral	cancer_was	associated	with	two	new	regions	,	2p23.3	(	rs6547741	,	GPN1	)	and	9q34.12	(	rs928674	,	LAMC3	)	,	and	with	known	cancer	-	related	loci-9p21.3	(	rs8181047	,	regulation_of_cyclin	-	dependent_protein_serine	/	threonine_kinase_activity	-	AS1	)	and	5p15.33	(	rs10462706	,	CLPTM1L	)	.	.
s3336	Corresponding	implicated	genes	,	such	as	TNNI3	K	,	negative_regulation_of_cell_adhesion	,	MKL2	,	MTNR1B	and	PRKD1	,	may	explain	the	associations	between	reproductive	factors	and	heart_failure	.	.
s740	We	queried	the	loci	hyper	-	methylated	in	serrated	cancers	within	our	rightsided	SSA	/	biological_process_from	the	New	Hampshire	Colonoscopy	Registry	,	using	the	Illumina	Infinium	Human	Methylation	450	k	panel	to	comprehensively	assess	the	DNA	methylation	status	.	.
s1590	These	data	link	microRNA	impairment	to	the	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	-	IGF2	pathway	,	providing	new	insight	into	the	manner	in	which	common	Wilms	tumor_mutations	drive	disease	pathogenesis	.
s1024	Biallelic	mutations	in	these	genes	cause	Fanconi	anemia	(	FA	)	,	characterized	by	malformations	,	bone	marrow	failure	,	chromosome	fragility	,	and	cancer_predisposition	(	BRCA2/FANCD1	and	PALB2/FANCN	)	,	or	an	FA	-	like	disease	presenting	a	phenotype	similar	to	FA	but	without	bone	marrow	failure	(	BRCA1/double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination	)	.	.
s1072	4	)	Multiple	endocrine	neoplasia_type	2A	from	regulation_of_cell_adhesion_activating	mutation	rarely	presents	as	familial	hyperparathyroidism	,	because	medullary	thyroid	cancer	and	pheochromocytoma	are	more	prominent	.	.
s1851	This	bioinformatics	analysis	demonstrated	that	stage	-	related	prognostic	DEGs	,	such	as	COL3A1	,	COL1A1	,	COL1A2	,	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	,	and	NRAS	might	play	an	unfavorable	role	in	the	development	as	well	as	metastasis	of	ovarian	cancer	.	.
s1802	The	gene	expression	levels	of	regulation_of_proteasomal_protein_catabolic_process-67	,	BCL11A	,	FOXC1	,	HOXD13	,	PCDHGB7	and	her-2	were	used	as	an	auxiliary	diagnostic	index	for	patients	with	breast	cancer_in	the	early	stage	.	.
