s3642	fatty_acid_metabolic_process_knockdown	caused	marked	inhibition	of	liver	cancer_cell	proliferation	and	clonogenicity	,	whereas	the	overexpression	of	MORC2	substantially	promoted	liver	cancer	cell	proliferation	.	.
s1911	To	explore	the	relationship	between	mouse	double	minute	2	binding	protein	(	protein_localization_to_kinetochore	)	and	the	prognosis	of	cancer_patients	,	a	databank	-	based	reanalysis	was	conducted	and	a	clinical	observation	about	lung	adenocarcinoma	was	taken	to	verify	the	result	of	data	analysis	.	We	reanalyzed	all	the	downloaded	data	in	order	to	make	a	conclusion	about	the	relationship	between	MTBP	and	the	prognosis	of	cancer	patients	.	.
s3818	Meanwhile	,	the	expression	of	protein_dephosphorylation_was	found	to	be	regulated	by	miR-199	in	resistant	ovarian	cancer_cells	.	.
s3912	This	similarity	was	revealed	by	the	same	number	of	passages	,	the	same	germ	cell	clusters	formation	and	similar	level	of	genes	expression	of	spermatogonial	markers	including	ubiquitin	carboxyl	-	terminal	esterase	L1	(	UCHL1	)	,	zinc	finger	and	BTB	domain	containing	16	(	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	)	and	glial	cell	line	-	derived	neurotrophic	factor	family	receptor	alpha	1	(	GFRA1	)	,	as	well	as	germ	cell	differentiation	markers	including	signal	transducer	and	activator	of	transcription	3	(	STAT3	)	,	spermatogenesis	and	oogenesis	specific	basic	helix	-	loophelix	2	(	SOHLH2	)	,	v	-	kit	Hardy	-	Zuckerman	4	feline	sarcoma_viral	oncogene	homolog	(	KIT	)	and	synaptonemal	complex	protein	3	(	SYCP3	)	.	.
s3929	Overall	,	16	(	1	%	)	of	1,579	pancreatic	cancer_cases	had	an	ER	stress	-	inducing	CPA1	or	proteolysis_variant	,	compared	with	1	of	2,068	controls	(	P	AAAA	0.00001	)	.	.
s3983	In	contrast	,	the	regulation_of_dopamine_secretion	/	TNNI2	fusion	transcript	resulting	from	transcription	-	induced	chimerism	by	read	-	through	mechanisms	was	a	rather	common	and	tumor	-	specific	event	occurring	in	37.5	%	(	18/48	)	of	the	UC	specimens	.	.
s3035	Moreover	,	in	patients	with	low	MRPL13	expression	,	two	oxidative	metabolic	indicators	,	pyruvate	dehydrogenase	B	expression	and	the	ratio	of	lactate	dehydrogenase	type	B	to	type	A	,	significantly	and	negatively	correlated	with	protein_depalmitoylation_expression	,	indicating	that	the	combination	of	elevated	glycolysis	and	deficient	MRPL13	activity	was	closely	linked	to	CLN1-mediated	tumor_activity	in	LIHC	.	.
s2254	Over	-	expression	of	aspartyl	(	asparagynal)-b	-	hydroxylase	(	positive_regulation_of_proteolysis	)	contributes	to	hepatocellular_carcinoma_(HCC	)	invasiveness	,	but	the	role	of	ASPH	hydroxylase	activity	in	this	process	remains	to	be	defined	.	.
s954	We	compared	the	distribution	and	localization	of	UC	and	esterified	cholesterol	(	EC	)	,	the	age	-	related	macular_degeneration_(AMD	)	associated	EFEMP1/Fibulin3	(	Fib3	)	,	and	levels	of	acyl	-	coenzyme	A	(	CoA	)	,	cholesterol	acyltransferases	(	ACAT	)	ACAT1	,	ACAT2	and	Apolipoprotein	B	(	ApoB	)	in	Acarbohydrate_metabolic_process-19	cells	cultured	in	serum	-	supplemented	and	serum	-	free	media	.	.
s3769	We	identified	30	new	blood	pressure-	or	hypertension	-	associated	genetic	regions	in	the	general	population	,	including	3	rare	missense	variants	in	hematopoietic_progenitor_cell_differentiation	,	COL21A1	and	RRAS	with	larger	effects	(	AAAA1.5	mm	Hg	/	allele	)	than	common	variants	.	.
s3072	Thus	,	our	data	indicate	that	in	pancreatic	cancer_cells	,	the	expression	of	ENG	may	be	controlled	by	a	pathway	mediated	by	transforming_growth_factor_beta_receptor_signaling_pathway	.	.
s76	Mutations	in	the	membrane	frizzled	-	related	protein	(	MFRP	/	embryo_development_ending_in_birth_or_egg_hatching	)	gene	,	specifically	expressed	in	the	retinal	pigment	epithelium	(	RPE	)	and	ciliary	body	,	cause	nanophthalmia	or	posterior	microphthalmia_with	retinitis	pigmentosa	in	humans	,	and	photoreceptor	degeneration	in	mice	.	.
s246	Genotype	-	phenotype	correlation	was	clarified	after	combined	analysis	of	the	cases	and	the	literature	review	,	anemia	was	most	severe	in	HS	patients	with	mutations	on	the	ANK1	spectrin	-	binding	domain	(	p	AAAA	0.05	)	,	and	MAPK_cascade_mutations	in	HS	patients	spared	the	tetramerization	domain	in	which	mutations	of	hereditary	elliptocytosis	and	pyropoikilocytosis_are	located	.	.
s365	Evidence	is	accumulating	to	suggest	that	mutations	in	the	Ankyrin	and	SOCS	Box	-	containing	protein-10	(	post	-	translational_protein_modification	)	gene	are	associated	with	glaucoma	.	.
s2549	To	identify	the	genes	that	are	targets	of	constitutive	PI3K	/	AKT	signalling	in	lung	cancer_cells	,	we	performed	a	comparative	transcriptomic	analysis	of	human	lung	epithelial	cells	(	BEAS-2B	)	expressing	active	mutant	AKT1	(	AKT1-E17	K	)	,	active	mutant	PIK3CA	(	PIK3CA	-	E545	K	)	or	that	are	silenced	for	negative_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	.	.
s2230	In	the	present	study	,	we	sought	to	identify	the	factors	involved	in	the	RARAAAAAalpha	,-	mediated	transcriptional	regulation	of	the	tumor_suppressor	gene	and	the	tissue	factor	pathway	inhibitor	2	(	blood_coagulation	)	in	hepatocellular	carcinoma	(	HCC	)	.	.
s767	We	here	review	the	current	knowledge	and	recent	findings	in	the	known	genes	for	isolated	dystonia_TOR1A	,	THAP1	,	and	GNAL	as	well	as	for	the	combined	dystonias	due	to	mutations	in	GCH1	,	ATP1A3	,	and	skeletal_muscle_tissue_development	.	.
s2821	We	investigated	the	diagnostic	and	prognostic	capability	of	branching_involved_in_blood_vessel_morphogenesis_and	COL13A1	in	voided	urine	and	compared	the	observed	values	with	those	of	fragments	of	cytokeratin-19	(	CYFRA21	-	1	)	,	nuclear	matrix	protein	22	(	NMP-22	)	,	and	voided	urine	cytology	in	bladder	cancer_(BCa	)	.	.
s3525	After	exclusive	analysis	of	10	common	variations	of	three	hearing_loss	-	related	genes	,	gap_junction_assembly	,	mtDNA12srRNA	and	SLC26A4	,	a	novel	truncated	variant	of	SMPX	,	c.87dupA	(	p	.	Gly30Argfs	12	)	(	NCBI	ClinVar	Submission	ID	,	SUB3136126	)	,	was	identified	by	whole	-	exome	sequencing	.	.
s143	Treatment	with	DNA	methyltransferase	inhibitors	has	been	proposed	as	an	attractive	strategy	to	increase	the	expression	of	cancer	/	testis	antigens	in	tumors	before	immunotargeting	,	however	,	neither	ADAM2	,	CALR3	nor	snRNA_3'-end_processing_could	be	significantly	induced	in	lung	and	breast	cancer	cell	lines	using	this	strategy	.	.
s2597	In	addition	,	silencing	of	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_markedly	increased	the	apoptosis	of	PCa	cells	in	vitro	,	and	decreased	the	expression	of	IL-8	,	AT2R	,	CCND1	and	MMP9	which	are	associated	with	cancer_progression	.	.
s3304	cation_transport_is	needed	by	brain	metastatic	cells	from	breast	cancer_(MDA	-	MB-231-BrM2	)	to	probe	their	physical	environment	as	they	anchor	and	pull	on	their	surroundings	or	when	confronted	with	confined	migration	through	narrow	pores	.	.
s1941	This	study	aimed	to	assess	the	effect	of	long	noncoding	RNAs	(	lncRNAs	)	taurine	-	upregulated	gene	1	(	TUG1	)	on	cells	proliferation	and	apoptosis	as	well	as	its	targeting	genes	in	epithelial	ovarian	cancer_(EOC	)	cells	.	Blank	mimic	,	lncRNA	TUG1	mimic	,	blank	inhibitor	,	and	lncRNA	TUG1	inhibitor	plasmids	were	transfected	into	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	-	OV-3	(	SKOV3	)	cells	.	.
s2500	CHD	proteins	play	an	important	role	in	neurodevelopment	,	as	pathogenic	variants	in	CHD1	,	CHD2	,	CHD4	,	skeletal_system_development_and	CHD8	have	been	associated	with	a	range	of	neurological	phenotypes	,	including	autism	spectrum	disorder	(	ASD	)	,	intellectual_disability_(ID	)	and	epilepsy	.	.
s3162	This	essential	role	of	positive_regulation_of_cytosolic_calcium_ion_concentration_in	mechanotransduction	and	cell	survival	that	,	we	show	,	is	restricted	to	the	cochlea	,	probably	accounts	for	the	presence	in	CIB2-/-	mice	and	CIB2	patients	,	unlike	in	Usher	syndrome	,	of	isolated	hearing_loss_without	balance	and	vision	deficits	.
s1206	In	particular	,	MYH9	mutations	result	in	congenital	macrothrombocytopenia	and	predispose	to	kidney	failure	,	hearing	loss	,	and	cataracts	,	MPL	and	MECOM	mutations	cause	congenital	thrombocytopenia	evolving	into	bone	marrow	failure	,	whereas	thrombocytopenias	caused	by	RUNX1	,	ANKRD26	,	and	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_mutations	are	characterized	by	predisposition	to	hematological	malignancies	.	.
s628	In	addition	,	we	found	that	FOXC1	regulation	of	RAB3GAP1	,	establishment_of_protein_localization_to_endoplasmic_reticulum_membrane_and	SNAP25	affects	secretion	of	Myocilin	(	MYOC	)	,	a	protein	associated	with	juvenile_onset_glaucoma	and	steroid	-	induced	glaucoma	.	.
s812	In	childhood	tumors	,	including	retinoblastoma	,	osteosarcoma	,	and	neuroblastoma	,	the	regulation_of_lipid_kinase_activity	-	E2F1	pathway	is	inactivated	,	as	a	rule	.	.
s3949	Five	genes	,	including	OTOGL	,	PLCB4	,	SCEL	,	THSD4	,	and	WWOX	,	have	CNVs	in	the	six	patients	with	sporadic_HBs	,	and	three	genes	,	including	lipid_transport	,	CWC27	,	and	LAMA2	,	have	CNVs	in	the	five	patients	with	familial	HBs	.	.
s2343	We	conclude	that	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_c.602TAAAAC	(	p	.	Leu201Pro	)	is	related	to	midfrequency	hearing_loss_in	this	family	.	.
s3377	This	indicates	that	dopamine	-	mediated	synaptic	remodeling	and	plasticity	is	independent	of	dopamine	innervation	during	SPN	development	and	that	lens_development_in_camera	-	type_eye-/-	mice	are	a	good	model	because	they	develop	the	same	pathology	described	in	the	toxins	-	based	models	and	in	human	postmortem	studies	of	advanced	PD.SIGNIFICANCE	STATEMENT	As	the	only	genetic	model	of	Parkinson	s	disease	(	PD	)	that	develops	dyskinesia	,	Pitx3-/-	mice	reproduce	the	behavioral	effects	seen	in	humans	and	are	a	good	system	for	studying	dopamine	-	induced	synaptic	remodeling	.	.
s565	glycoprotein_catabolic_process_patients	produce	little	or	no	N	-	glycanase	(	Ngly1	)	,	and	the	symptoms	include	global	developmental_delay	,	frequent	seizures	,	complex	hyperkinetic	movement	disorder	,	difficulty	in	swallowing	/	aspiration	,	liver	dysfunction	,	and	a	lack	of	tears	.	.
s833	Bartter	syndrome	type	3	is	a	clinically	heterogeneous_hereditary	salt	-	losing	tubulopathy	caused	by	mutations	of	the	chloride	voltage	-	gated	channel	Kb	gene	(	CLCNKB	)	,	which	encodes	the	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation	-	Kb	chloride	channel	involved	in	NaCl	reabsorption	in	the	renal	tubule	.	.
s4052	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_overexpression	greatly	enhanced	HCC	cell	capability	for	tumorsphere	formation	,	invasion	and	chemoresistance	in	vitro	,	whereas	inhibiting	ZNF687	reduced	these	capabilities	and	inhibited	HCC	cell	tumorigenic	capability	in	vivo	.	.
s1150	Suppression	of	protein_polyubiquitination-1274a	significantly	inhibited	cancer_cell	proliferation	and	induced	apoptosis	in	the	ccRCC	cells	.	.
s2887	This	case	suggested	a	broad	phenotypic	spectrum	arises	from	corpus_callosum_morphogenesis_mutations	,	forming	a	continuum	from	epileptic	encephalopathy	and	severe	developmental_delay_to	mild	intellectual	disability	without	epilepsy	.	.
s742	Hyper	-	methylated	CpG	loci	included	the	known	the	tumor_suppressor	gene	regulation_of_cell_adhesion_(p	=	5.72	x	10	-	10	)	,	as	well	as	loci	in	differentially	methylated	regions	for	GSG1L	,	MIR4493	,	NTNG1	,	MCIDAS	,	ZNF568	,	and	RERG	.	.
s1396	This	chapter	focuses	on	the	current	data	covering	the	etiology	and	epidemiology	,	clinical	presentation	,	and	pathogenesis	of	four	monogenic	forms	of	isolated	dystonia	,	DYT	-	TOR1A	,	DYT	-	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	DYT	-	GCH1	,	and	DYT	-	GNAL	.
s3886	Here	,	we	demonstrate	that	MNK	sustains	regulation_of_cell_growthC1	activity	following	rapamycin	treatment	and	contributes	to	mTORC1	signaling	following	T	cell	activation	and	growth	stimuli	in	cancer_cells	.	.
s2901	The	present	study	also	identified	in	tumor	and	potentially	malignant	lesions	common	alterations	of	chromosomal	regions	and	genes	,	including	FBXL5	,	cellular_glucuronidation	,	UGT2B28	,	KANSL1	,	GSTT1	and	DUSP22	,	being	some	of	these	typical	aberrations	described	in	oral	cancer_and	others	are	linked	to	chemoradioresistance	.	.
s2927	In	patients	harboring	selenocysteine_incorporation_mutations	,	severe	,	progressive	,	cerebello	-	cerebral_atrophy_(pontocerebellar	hypoplasia	type	2D	)	dominates	the	phenotype	and	it	is	not	known	whether	the	disorder	is	associated	with	thyroid	dysfunction	.
s7	Data	on	the	relationship	between	ribosome	biogenesis	and	DNA_strand_renaturation_function	indicate	that	the	tumour_suppressor	can	be	activated	by	either	nucleolar	disruption	or	ribosomal	protein	defects	.	.
s739	We	queried	the	loci	hyper	-	methylated	in	serrated	cancers	within	our	rightsided	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	/	Ps	from	the	New	Hampshire	Colonoscopy	Registry	,	using	the	Illumina	Infinium	Human	Methylation	450	k	panel	to	comprehensively	assess	the	DNA	methylation	status	.	.
s2107	We	found	that	(	i	)	microtubule	-	based_movement_motility	differs	significantly	from	Eg5	,	(	ii	)	KIF15-IN-1	is	a	potent	inhibitor	of	KIF15	motility	,	(	iii	)	MT	gliding	powered	by	KIF15	and	Eg5	only	ceases	when	both	motors	are	inhibited	,	and	(	iv	)	pairing	KIF15-IN-1	with	Eg5	inhibitors	synergistically	reduces	cancer_cell	growth	.	.
s1002	Knockdown	of	PPP2R1B	expression	increases	AKT	phosphorylation	,	which	leads	to	elevated	XIAP	expression	and	enhanced	5-regulation_of_DNA	-	binding_transcription_factor_activity_resistance	,	whereas	rescue	of	PPP2R1B	expression	in	miR-587-expressing	cells	decreases	AKT	phosphorylation	/	XIAP	expression	,	re	-	sensitizing	colon	cancer_cells	to	5-FU	-	induced	apoptosis	.	.
s280	In	conclusion	,	the	present	study	demonstrated	,	for	the	first	time	,	the	expression	and	function	of	positive_regulation_of_angiogenesis_in	neuroblastomas	and	the	inhibitory	effect	of	PF-3758309	,	which	deserves	further	investigation	as	an	alternative	strategy	for	neuroblastoma	treatment	.
s3941	The	created	databases	include	ACAD8	(	isobutyryl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	deficiency	(	IBD	)	)	,	ACADSB	(	short	-	chain	acyl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	(	SCAD	)	deficiency	)	,	AUH	(	3-methylglutaconic	aciduria	(	3-MGCA	)	)	,	DHCR7	(	Smith	-	Lemli	-	Opitz	syndrome	)	,	acetyl	-	CoA_metabolic_process_(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl	-	CoA	synthase	2	deficiency	)	,	HSD17B10	(	17-beta	-	hydroxysteroid	dehydrogenase	X	deficiency	)	,	FKBP14	(	Ehlers	-	Danlos	syndrome	with	progressive	kyphoscoliosis	,	myopathy	,	and	hearing	loss	,	EDSKMH	)	and	ROGDI	(	Kohlschutter	-	Tonz	syndrome	)	.	.
s2860	Undifferentiated	gonadal	tissue	is	the	precursor	of	classical	gonadoblastoma_and	contains	germ	cells	with	delayed	maturation	that	express	octamer	-	binding	transcription	factor	4	(	OCT4	)	,	however	,	other	germ	cells	show	normal	maturation	and	express	sex_differentiation	.	.
s1747	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	cell	-	matrix_adhesion	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s4033	In	contrast	,	the	regulation_of_dopamine_secretion	/	TNNI2	fusion	transcript	resulting	from	transcription	-	induced	chimerism	by	read	-	through	mechanisms	was	a	rather	common	and	tumor	-	specific	event	occurring	in	37.5	%	(	18/48	)	of	the	UC	specimens	.	.
s2408	Our	study	revealed	that	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_attenuates	tumor_metastasis	by	suppressing	YAP	expression	,	suggesting	that	LIFR	may	serve	as	a	potential	target	for	ccRCC	treatment	.
s2732	However	,	certain	chromatin	remodeling	genes	(	MLL1	,	MLL2	,	MLL3	,	BAP1	,	PBRM1	,	EED	,	and	ATRX	)	were	found	to	be	mutated	in	7/22	(	32	%	)	of	intraductal	tubulopapillary	neoplasms	and	27	%	harbored	phosphatidylinositol	3-kinase	(	PI3	K	)	pathway	(	PIK3CA	,	PIK3CB	,	INPP4A	,	and	negative_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	)	mutations	.	.
s990	RT	-	PCR	analysis	showed	that	the	overall	transcriptional	activity	of	the	main	HS	biosynthesis	-	involved	genes	(	EXT1	,	EXT2	,	NDST1	,	NDST2	,	GLCE	,	HS2ST1	,	HS3ST1	,	HS3ST2	,	HS6ST1	,	HS6ST2	,	negative_regulation_of_endothelial_cell_proliferation	,	SULF2	,	HPSE	)	was	decreased	by	1.5	-	2-fold	in	Grade	II	-	III	glioma	(	p	AAAA	0.01	)	and	by	3-fold	in	Grade	IV	glioma	(	glioblastoma	multiforme	,	GBM	)	(	p	AAAA	0.05	)	,	as	compared	with	the	para	-	tumourous	tissue	.	.
s1474	In	the	present	study	,	the	results	obtained	from	our	previously	published	methylation	array	were	analyzed	and	10	candidate	genes	involved	in	DNA	repair	[	protein	phosphatase	4	catalytic	subunit	(	PPP4C	)	]	,	apoptosis	[	runt	related	transcription	factor	3	(	RUNX3	)	,	interferon	regulatory	factor	4	(	IRF4	)	,	ubiquitin	C	-	terminal	hydrolase	L1	(	UCHL1	)	and	tumor_protein	p53	inducible	protein	3	(	TP53I3	)	]	,	cell	proliferation	[	cyclin	D2	(	CCND2	)	and	Ras	association	domain	family	member	1	(	RASSF1	)	]	,	drug	metabolism	[	aldehyde	dehydrogenase	1	family	member	A3	(	ALDH1A3	)	and	solute	carrier	family	29	member	1	(	SLC29A1	)	]	and	angiogenesis	[	human	immunodeficiency	virus-1	2-oxoglutarate_metabolic_process_interactive	protein	2	(	HTATIP2	)	]	were	selected	for	quantification	of	their	methylation	levels	in	54	CCA	and	19	adjacent	normal	tissues	using	methylation	-	sensitive	high	-	resolution	melting	.	.
s2313	They	affect	water_transport	,	AQP5	and	AQP8	,	where	they	are	associated	with	nephrogenic	diabetes	insipidus	,	keratoderma	and	colorectal	cancer	,	respectively	.	.
s731	Recently	mutations	in	the	CASPR	/	cell_adhesion_complex	have	been	associated	with	similar	severe	phenotypes	and	CNTNAP1	gene	mutations	,	causing	loss	of	the	CASPR	protein	,	were	shown	to	cause	severe	,	prenatal_onset_arthrogryposis	multiplex	congenita	in	four	unrelated	families	.	.
s2973	Many	cancer	-	causing	chromosomal	translocations	result	in	transactivating	protein	products	encoding	FET	family	(	FUS	,	regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	,	TAF15	)	low	-	complexity	(	LC	)	domains	fused	to	a	DNA	binding	domain	from	one	of	several	transcription	factors	.	.
s3981	SSRI	use	was	obtained	from	telephone	interviews	with	mothers	.	Results	For	women	who	reported	taking	SSRIs	periconceptionally	,	maternal	glycine_metabolic_process_(rs9909104	)	GG	and	AGgenotypes	were	associated	with	a	5.9	and	2.4	increased	risk	of	select	congenital_heart_defects_in	offspring	,	respectively	,	versus	the	AA	genotype	(	BFDP=0.69	)	.	.
s3107	In	summary	,	a	15-lncRNA	expression	signature	(	BAIAP2-AS1	,	RP11	-	203J24.8	,	LINC01133	,	RP1	-	7G5.6	,	RP11	-	147L13.15	,	SERHL	,	CTC-537E7.3	,	RP11	-	440L14.1	,	RP11	-	131N11.4	,	protein_phosphorylation	-	AS1	,	RP11	-	80H18.4	,	RP11	-	1096G20.5	,	CTD-2192J16.26	,	RP11	-	621L6.3	,	and	RP11	-	571M6.18	)	were	identified	and	validated	which	can	predict	cervical	cancer_patient	survival	.	.
s62	The	created	databases	include	ACAD8	(	isobutyryl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	deficiency	(	IBD	)	)	,	ACADSB	(	short	-	chain	acyl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	(	SCAD	)	deficiency	)	,	AUH	(	3-methylglutaconic	aciduria	(	3-MGCA	)	)	,	DHCR7	(	Smith	-	Lemli	-	Opitz	syndrome	)	,	HMGCS2	(	3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl	-	CoA	synthase	2	deficiency	)	,	HSD17B10	(	17-beta	-	hydroxysteroid	dehydrogenase	X	deficiency	)	,	FKBP14	(	Ehlers	-	Danlos	syndrome	with	progressive	kyphoscoliosis	,	myopathy	,	and	hearing	loss	,	EDSKMH	)	and	brain_development_(Kohlschutter	-	Tonz	syndrome	)	.	.
s1643	Conclusions	,	During	the	natural	course	of	advanced	lung	cancer	,	the	incidence	of	anemia	is	high	,	especially	telomere_maintenance	.	.
s199	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal	recessive	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	protein_polyubiquitination	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy_(SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s3605	We	previously	reported	that	brain	-	derived	neurotrophic	factor	(	BDNF)/neurotrophic	receptor	tyrosine	kinase	2	(	Nprotein_phosphorylation2/TRKB	)	signaling	contributes	to	induction	of	malignant	phenotype	of	gallbladder	cancer_(GBC	)	.	.
s3361	We	report	on	two	children	,	displaying	intellectual_disability_(ID	)	and	peculiar	congenital	eyes	anomalies	,	both	carrying	a	de	novo	nonsense	mutation	in	the	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_gene	.	.
s1245	This	is	the	first	case	of	positive_regulation_of_GTPase_activity	-	related	intellectual_disability_presenting	with	severe	self	-	injury	with	improvement	following	treatment	.	.
s3661	Altogether	,	these	data	indicate	that	the	cerebral_cortex_development	-	regulated	NF	-	kB	signaling	pathway	plays	a	pivotal	role	in	the	chemoresistance	of	gastric	cancer_by	promoting	CD133-induced	EMT	.
s1708	Around	50	%	of	patient	s	relatives	with	PMAH	and	30	%	of	apparently	sporadic_hypercortisolism	carried	biological_process_mutations	.	.
s1162	Methods	,	Ten	potentially	functional	single	nucleotide	polymorphisms	(	SNPs	)	in	seven	prostate	CSC	marker	genes	,	negative_regulation_of_epithelial_cell_migration	,	PROM1	,	ITGA2	,	POU5F1	,	EZH2	,	PSCA	,	and	CD44	,	were	selected	for	analysis	of	their	association	with	disease	recurrence	by	Kaplan	-	Meier	analysis	and	Cox	regression	in	a	cohort	of	320	patients	with	localized	prostate	cancer_receiving	radical	prostatectomy	.	.
s584	Gene	-	based	tests	highlighted	20	additional	genes	of	which	5	had	previously	been	associated	to	schizophrenia_and	/	or	bipolar	disorder	,	startle_response	,	CCDC141	,	SLC1A2	,	CACNA1C	,	and	SNAP25	.	.
s3900	We	found	monoallelic	truncating	/	functionally	deleterious	mutations	in	seven	genes	,	including	ATM	and	CHEK2	,	which	have	previously	been	associated	with	PrCa	predisposition	,	and	five	new	candidate	PrCa	associated	genes	involved	in	cancer_predisposing	recessive	disorders	,	namely	RAD51C	,	FANCD2	,	FANCI	,	fibroblast_growth_factor_receptor_signaling_pathway_and	RECQL4	.	.
s2303	The	JU	-	negative_regulation_of_endopeptidase_activity_cells	have	a	sub	-	tetraploid	karyotype	including	the	1,10	chromosomal	translocation	and	amplification	of	the	proximal	end	of	3p	,	these	features	are	considered	genetic	signatures	of	myxoinflammatory	fibroblastic	sarcoma	.	.
s1136	Using	this	gene	panel	,	we	were	able	to	identify	disease	-	causing	variants	in	17	out	of	87	(	19.5	%	)	analyzed	patients	,	all	found	in	known	epilepsy	-	associated	genes	(	KCNQ2	,	CDKL5	,	protein_localization_to_plasma_membrane	,	SCN1A	,	PCDH19	,	POLG	,	SLC2A1	,	ARX	,	ALG13	,	CHD2	,	SYNGAP1	,	and	GRIN1	)	.	.
s3303	Patient	-	derived	cells	were	genetically	complemented	upon	wild	-	type	resolution_of_meiotic_recombination_intermediates_complementary	DNA	expression	.	ConclusionLoss	-	of	-	function	mutations	in	FANCM	cause	a	cancer_predisposition	syndrome	clinically	distinct	from	bona	fide	FA	.	.
s473	Suppression	of	pS14-negative_regulation_of_Wnt_signaling_pathway_by	Zfra	reduces	cancer_growth	and	mitigates	Alzheimer	s	disease	progression	,	suggesting	that	pS14-WWOX	facilitates	disease	progression	.	.
s2670	FLNB	-	related	disorders	are	classified	as	spondylocarpotarsal	synostosis	(	brain_development	)	,	Larsen	syndrome	(	LS	)	,	atelosteogenesis	(	AO	)	,	boomerang	dysplasia	(	BD	)	,	and	isolated	congenital	talipes	equinovarus	,	presenting	with	scoliosis	,	short	-	limbed	dwarfism	,	clubfoot	,	joint	dislocation	and	other	unique	skeletal	abnormalities	.	.
s1565	Taken	together	,	we	show	here	that	mutations	leading	either	to	hematopoietic_stem_cell_migration_haploinsufficiency	or	to	a	truncated	BCL11B	protein	clinically	cause	a	non	-	syndromic	neurodevelopmental_delay	.	.
s2931	Whole	exome	sequencing	of	the	patient	and	his	parents	ruled	out	mutations	in	11	known	hypodontia	-	associated	genes	including	WNT10A	,	MSX1	,	positive_regulation_of_NF	-	kappaB_transcription_factor_activity	,	EDAR	,	EDARADD	,	PAX9	,	AXIN2	,	GREM2	,	NEMO	,	KRT17	,	and	TFAP2B.	.
s917	In	order	to	expand	the	mutation	spectrum	of	the	causative	genes	in	Chinese	adult	population	,	we	investigated	three	genes	,	eye_development	,	LEPREL1	and	LRPAP1	,	in	a	cohort	of	187	independent	Chinese	patients	with	high	myopia	.	.
s805	Herein	,	we	report	biallelic	pathogenic	variants	in	cell_proliferation_in	12	individuals	from	6	independent	families	with	an	intellectual_disability_syndrome	associated	with	seizures	and	dysmorphic	features	.	.
s680	Alterations	of	von	Hippel	-	Lindau	(	VHL	)	,	succinate	dehydrogenase	(	sarcosine_catabolic_processX	)	,	and	TMEM127	have	been	associated	with	the	development	of	pheochromocytomas	(	PCs	)	and	paragangliomas_(PGLs	)	and	are	also	associated	with	the	development	of	renal	neoplasms	.	.
s2302	Using	human	neuroblastoma_SH	-	SY5Y	cells	in	culture	,	we	also	observed	that	human	proteolysis_is	ubiquitinated	by	UBE3A	,	without	being	targeted	for	degradation	.	.
s1351	In	this	study	,	the	fluorescence	lifetime	of	the	metabolic	coenzyme	NADH	reveals	that	the	absence	of	error	-	prone_translesion_synthesis_can	promote	the	p53-mediated	upregulation	of	oxidative	phosphorylation	in	cisplatin	-	treated	H1299	lung	carcinoma	cells	and	increases	cancer_cell	sensitivity	to	this	platinum	-	based	chemotherapy	.	.
s1861	However	,	the	precise	role	of	protein_polyubiquitinationNAs	in	gastric	cancer_(GC	)	has	not	been	elucidated	.	.
s660	Mutations	in	the	glutaminyl	-	tRNA	synthetase	(	prolyl	-	tRNA_aminoacylation	)	gene	have	been	reported	in	patients	with	progressive	microcephaly	,	cerebral	-	cerebellar	atrophy	,	and	intractable	seizures	.	.
s2214	RNA_catabolic_process_deficiency	in	humans	is	associated	with	infant	cystic	leukoencephalopathy	,	which	causes	psychomotor	impairment	,	spasticity	and	epilepsy	.	.
s116	We	have	identified	mitotic_cell_cycle_variants	in	individuals	with	autosomal	-	recessive	microcephaly_and	chorioretinopathy	.	.
s2053	Steroid	21-Hydroxylase	deficiency	is	an	inherited	autosomal_recessive_metabolic	disorder	of	the	adrenal	steroidogenesis	caused	due	to	mutations	in	the	steroid_biosynthetic_process_gene	in	95	%	of	CAH	cases	.	.
s1443	By	using	quantitative	(	real	-	time	)	PCR	,	western	blot	analysis	,	and	immunocytochemical	staining	,	three	non	-	small	cell	lung	cancer_(NSCLC	)	cell	lines	(	A427	,	A549	and	NCI	-	H358	)	were	analyzed	for	the	expression	of	EpoR	and	its	specific	downstream	signaling	pathways	[	Janus	kinase	2	(	positive_regulation_of_cell	-	substrate_adhesion)-signal	transducer	and	activator	of	transcription	5	(	STAT5	)	,	phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase	(	PI3K)-Akt	,	mitogen	-	activated	protein	(	MAP	)	kinase	]	.	.
s300	Mutations	in	C8ORF37	were	previously	associated	with	severe	autosomal_recessive_retinal	dystrophies	(	retinitis	pigmentosa	RP64	and	cone	-	rod	dystrophy	CORD16	)	but	not	visual_perception	.	.
s100	The	finding	expands	the	molecular	basis	of	congenital	contractures_and	the	phenotypic	spectrum	of	respiratory_system_process_mutations	.	.
s3719	Further	haplotype	and	imputation	analyses	also	validated	these	results	,	and	bioinformatics	analyses	indicated	that	cation_transport	,	which	is	located	approximately	630	kb	away	from	CNNM2	,	might	be	a	susceptible	gene	for	schizophrenia	.	.
s2099	In	addition	,	the	coexistence	of	high	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_and	low	NM23-H1	expression	and	tumor_budding	was	associated	with	short	OS	(	p	AAAA	0.001	)	.	.
s1795	This	mini	review	discusses	the	roles	and	underlying	molecular	mechanisms	of	DNA_dealkylation_involved_in_DNA_repair_in	both	obesity_and	cancers	,	and	also	summarizes	recent	advances	in	the	development	of	FTO	inhibitors	.
s4040	Increased	expression	of	the	peptidyl	-	tyrosine_phosphorylation_homology	2	B	adaptor	protein	1	(	SH2B1	)	may	stimulate	the	malignant	progression	of	lung	cancer	,	esophageal	cancer	and	neuroblastoma	.	.
s3739	Other	EXOSC3	mutations	and	EXOSC8	cases	are	intermediate	;	spliceosomal_snRNP_assembly_type	1-like	presentation	,	spasticity_(mostly	in	EXOSC8	)	and	death	between	3	months	and	5	years	.	.
s2328	A	prognostication	scoring	system	was	established	based	on	the	expression	levels	of	RNASEH2A-	,	CDK1-	,	and	CD151-related	genes	,	which	could	effectively	predict	the	overall	survival	in	a	TCGA	clear	cell	RCC	cohort	(	n	=	533	,	995.3	versus	2242.2	days	,	p	AAAA	0.0001	)	,	in	another	clear_cell_renal_cell_carcinoma_(ccRCC	)	cohort	E	-	GEOD-22541	(	n	=	44	,	390.0	versus	1889.2	days	,	p	=	0.0007	)	,	and	in	a	TCGA	papillary	RCC	(	mitotic_cell_cycle_checkpoint	)	cohort	(	n	=	287	,	741.6	versus	1623.7	days	,	p	AAAA	0.0001	)	.	.
s1411	We	further	report	that	genetic	or	pharmacological	inhibition	of	USP13	considerably	reduces	response_to_cytokine_protein	abundance	and	significantly	increases	tumor_cell	sensitivity	to	BH3	mimetic	inhibitors	targeting	BCL-2	and	BCL	-	XL	.	.
s3683	The	variants	GJB2	c.235delC	,	regulation_of_pH_c.919	-	2AAAAAG	,	and	mitochondrial_variants	m.1555AAAAAG	and	m.1494CAAAAT	were	assayed	using	real	time	PCR	.	.
s1325	Misregulation	of	positive_regulation_of_stress	-	activated_MAPK_cascade_expression	is	associated	with	various	diseases	including	midline	malformation	syndromes	,	cancer_and	neurodegenerative	diseases	.	.
s2895	Top	10	genes	in	the	brown	module	,	including	EGF	containing	fibulin	like	extracellular	matrix	protein	2	(	EFEMP2	)	,	fibrillin	1	(	FBN1	)	and	secreted	protein	acidic	and	cysteine	rich	(	negative_regulation_of_endothelial_cell_proliferation	)	were	also	associated	with	survival	time	of	colon	cancer_patients	.	.
s538	Here	,	we	found	that	negative_regulation_of_platelet_aggregation_was	silenced	or	downregulated	in	breast	cancer_cell	lines	.	.
s3068	SPG56	is	a	rare	autosomal_recessive_early	onnegative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_complicated	form	of	HSP	caused	by	mutations	in	CYP2U1	.	.
s793	Segregation	analysis	of	heterozygous	variants	,	related	to	hearing_loss	,	identified	by	whole	exome	sequencing	in	the	child	(	protein_homooligomerization	,	c.1159TAAAAC	,	SYNE4	,	c.313GAAAAC	,	and	GPR98	,	c.18746TAAAAG	)	excluded	them	from	being	responsible	for	the	hearing	loss	in	the	proposita	.	.
s3701	The	aim	of	this	study	is	to	determine	the	role	of	serum	CK18	,	MMP-9	,	and	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_levels	in	predicting	R0	resection	in	patients	with	gastric	cancer	.	.
s522	To	date	variants	in	four	genes	GLI3	,	ZNF141	,	biological_process_and	PITX1	have	been	implicated	in	developing	non	-	syndromic	form	of	polydactyly	.	.
s1363	However	,	because	dicumarol	did	not	affect	well	-	known	apoptosis	inducers	,	such	as	anti	-	Fas	IgG	,	tumor_necrosis	factor	(	TNF)-a	,	TNF	-	related	apoptosis	-	inducing	ligand	,	UV	-	B	and	H2O2	of	HeLa	cells	at	all	,	we	concluded	that	regulation_of_cellular_amino_acid_metabolic_process	-	related	intracellular	reduction	of	CoQ	,	or	its	reduced	product	,	ubiquinol	,	may	participate	in	the	apoptosis	induction	of	HeLa	cells	.
s950	Giantin	-	knockout	zebrafish	exhibit	hyperostosis_and	ectopic	calcium	deposits	,	recapitulating	phenotypes	of	hyperphosphatemic	familial	tumoral	calcinosis	,	a	disease	caused	by	mutations	in	protein_O	-	linked_glycosylation_via_serine	.	.
s1268	Recently	,	we	developed	a	double	-	retargeting	strategy	whereby	gH	carries	the	GCN4	peptide	for	retargeting	to	the	noncancer_producer	Vero	-	GCN4R	cell	line	and	gD	carries	the	scFv	to	signal_transduction_for	cancer	retargeting	.	.
s146	Our	results	suggest	that	ADAM2	,	CALR3	and	snRNA_3'-end_processing_cancer	/	testis	antigens	are	not	promising	targets	for	immunotherapy	of	breast	and	lung	cancer	.	.
s909	Immunoperoxidase	levels	in	the	tumor_were	positive	for	factor	VIII	and	CD31	and	negative	for	S100	,	protein	Melan	-	A	,	CD34	,	synaptophysin	,	chromogranin	,	desmin	,	muscle	specific	actin	,	ETFA	(	EMA	)	,	intermediate_filament_organization_(CK20	)	,	CDX2	,	TTF1	,	LNPEP	(	PLAP	)	,	inhibin	,	?	-fetoprotein	,	CD30	,	hepatocyte	paraffin	,	and	aberrant	expression	of	cytokeratin	7	and	pankeratin	.	.
s434	Idiopathic	pulmonary	fibrosis	(	IPF	)	is	a	complex	,	heterogeneous_genetic	disorder	that	is	associated	with	rare	and	common	sequence	variants	in	many	genes	(	MUC5B	,	cellular_protein_metabolic_process	,	SFTPA2	,	RTEL1	,	TERT	,	and	hTR	)	,	11	novel	loci	,	and	multiple	emerging	epigenetic	and	transcriptional	profiles	.	.
s771	We	present	confirmatory	evidence	for	a	role	of	dystonia_genes	that	had	not	yet	been	unequivocally	established	including	PRKRA	,	TUBB4A	,	ANO3	,	and	protein_polyubiquitination	.	.
s1556	Among	those	with	peripheral_tumors	,	the	median	tumor	number	was	4	in	the	anatomical_structure_morphogenesis_group	(	median	total	body	tumor	volume	30	cc	)	and	10	in	the	SMARCB1	group	(	median	volume	85cc	)	,	(	P=.2915	for	tumor	number	and	P	=	.2289	for	volume	)	.	.
s2512	Moreover	,	comparison	of	the	porcine	results	to	those	reported	by	human	melanoma_GWAS	indicated	shared	association	signals	notably	at	CDKAL1	and	TERT	loci	but	also	nearby	CCND1	,	FTO	,	PLA2G6	and	TMEM38B	-	nucleotide	-	excision_repair,_DNA_damage_recognition_loci	.	.
s3833	Blocking	the	expression	of	integrin	cell_surface_receptor_signaling_pathwayb1	,	which	was	accomplished	by	transduction	of	a2-specific	shRNA	,	resulted	in	significant	inhibition	of	proliferation	and	clonal	activity	in	human	MCF-7	breast_carcinoma_and	SK	-	Mel-147	melanoma	cells	.	.
s2001	Mutations	in	the	activation_of_MAPK_activity_gene	,	which	encodes	both	the	cytosolic	and	mitochondrial	isoform	of	lysyl	-	tRNA	synthetase	,	cause	predominantly	neurological	diseases	that	often	involve	deafness	,	but	have	also	been	linked	to	cardiomyopathy	,	developmental	delay	and	lactic	acidosis	.	.
s1339	Here	we	show	that	the	microphthalmia	-	associated	transcription	factor	,	MITF	,	which	plays	a	central	role	in	the	development	and	function	of	RPE	cells	,	regulates	the	expression	of	two	visual	cycle	genes	,	Rlbp1	which	encodes	retinaldehyde	binding	protein-1	(	retinoid_metabolic_process	)	,	and	Rdh5	,	which	encodes	retinol	dehydrogenase-5	(	RDH5	)	.	.
s3019	Our	studies	identified	a	novel	homozygous	mutation	in	the	ciliary	protein	intraciliary_retrograde_transport_as	the	underlying	cause	of	recessive	inherited	retinal_degeneration	.	.
s2165	In	addition	,	eye_development_gene	and	protein	expression	levels	are	higher	in	GB	stem	-	like	cell	lines	than	in	conventional	glioblastoma_cell	lines	.	.
s1535	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_signaling	mutations	,	like	those	that	remove	Patched1	(	Ptch1	)	or	activate	Smoothened	(	Smo	)	,	cause	tumors	dependent	on	the	presence	of	cilia	.	.
s1621	Our	findings	highlight	the	importance	of	G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway_integrity	and	suggest	further	research	on	its	correlation	with	autism_and	neurobehavioral	problems	.
s3349	negative_regulation_of_systemic_arterial_blood_pressure_signalling	disruption	caused	by	Vangl2	(	Vangl2Lp/+	)	or	Celsr1	(	Celsr1Crsh/+	)	mutations	significantly	reduced	trabecular	bone	mass	and	distal_tibial	cortical	thickness	.	.
s1896	Heterozygous	de	novo	NALCN	missense	variants	in	the	S5/positive_regulation_of_RNA_polymerase_II_transcriptional_preinitiation_complex_assembly_pore	-	forming	segments	lead	to	congenital	contractures_of	the	limbs	and	face	,	hypotonia	,	and	developmental	delay	(	CLIFAHDD	,	OMIM	616266	)	with	some	clinical	overlap	.	.
s3966	myeloid_dendritic_cell_chemotaxis_rs3136685	AG+GG	(	p=0.032	)	was	associated	with	a	1.52	-	1.70	fold	increase	in	the	risk	of	high	grade	cancer_(Gleason	scoreG7	)	among	obese	men	.	.
s374	However	,	the	expression	levels	or	functions	of	negative_regulation_of_phosphatase_activity_in	lung	cancer_have	not	been	elucidated	.	.
s404	Mutations	in	the	LDB3	gene	have	been	identified	in	patients	with	Z	-	disc	-	associated	,	alternatively	spliced	,	PDZ	motif	-	containing	protein	(	sarcomere_organization)-related	myofibrillar	myopathy	(	ZASP	-	MFM	)	characterized	by	late	-	onset	distal	myopathy	with	signs	of	cardiomyopathy_and	neuropathy	.	.
s54	The	created	databases	include	ACAD8	(	isobutyryl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	deficiency	(	IBD	)	)	,	ACADSB	(	short	-	chain	acyl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	(	SCAD	)	deficiency	)	,	AUH	(	3-methylglutaconic	aciduria	(	3-MGCA	)	)	,	DHCR7	(	Smith	-	Lemli	-	Opitz	syndrome	)	,	HMGCS2	(	3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl	-	CoA	synthase	2	deficiency	)	,	HSD17B10	(	17-beta	-	hydroxysteroid	dehydrogenase	X	deficiency	)	,	FKBP14	(	Ehlers	-	Danlos	syndrome	with	progressive	kyphoscoliosis	,	myopathy	,	and	hearing	loss	,	EDSKMH	)	and	brain_development_(Kohlschutter	-	Tonz	syndrome	)	.	.
s1602	Consistent	with	this	result	,	mutations	in	the	CNTNAP2	gene	coding	for	learning_in	human	have	been	identified	in	neurodevelopmental	disorders	such	as	autism	,	intellectual	disability	,	and	epilepsy	.	.
s209	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal	recessive	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy_(SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/antigen_receptor	-	mediated_signaling_pathway	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s938	In	this	study	,	EPA	inhibited	the	expression	of	IDO	via	downregulation	of	protein	kinase	B	(	Akt)/mammalian	targets	of	rapamycin	(	regulation_of_cell_growth	)	signaling	pathway	in	tumor_cells	.	.
s3055	In	search	of	novel	germline	alterations	predisposing	to	tumors	,	in	particular	to	gliomas	,	we	studied	a	family	with	two	brothers	affected	by	anaplastic	gliomas	,	and	their	father	and	paternal	adenylate_cyclase	-	activating_G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway	-	uncle	diagnosed	with	prostate	carcinoma	.	.
s2933	Whole	exome	sequencing	of	the	patient	and	his	parents	ruled	out	mutations	in	11	known	hypodontia	-	associated	genes	including	WNT10A	,	MSX1	,	EDA	,	EDAR	,	EDARADD	,	PAX9	,	AXIN2	,	embryonic_body_morphogenesis	,	NEMO	,	KRT17	,	and	TFAP2B.	.
s2125	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	lipid_hydroxylation	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s3040	We	hypothesized	that	dual	inhibition	of	tricarboxylic_acid_cycle_and	MDH2	might	be	a	powerful	approach	to	target	cancer_metabolism	and	selected	methyl-3-(3-(4-(2,4,4-trimethylpentan-2-yl)phenoxy)propanamido)-benzoate	(	16c	)	as	the	most	potent	dual	inhibitor	.	.
s3466	Therefore	,	defects	in	the	protein_acetylation_genes	not	only	result	in	the	dysregulation	of	physiological	rhythms	but	also	induce	metabolic	disorders	including	diabetes	and	obesity	.	.
s2128	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	positive_regulation_of_protein_ubiquitination	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s2876	The	results	revealed	that	the	most	PR	-	specific	proteins	were	associated	with	events	involved	in	tumor	development	,	while	chemotherapy	in	the	biological_process_group	was	associated	with	side	effects	of	drugs	and/or	cancer_recurrence	.	.

s1242	positive_regulation_of_GTPase_activity	-	related	intellectual_disability_is	caused	by	mutations	in	the	gene	encoding	the	p21-activated	kinase	(	PAK	)	protein	.	.
s3181	These	data	may	improve	our	understanding	of	the	role	of	epithelial_to_mesenchymal_transition_in	tumors	and	provide	supporting	evidence	for	the	development	of	novel	therapeutic	targets	for	EC	.
s2147	We	found	that	positive_regulation_of_apoptotic_process_KO	mice	exhibited	abnormal	global	development	,	including	prenatal	lethality	,	microphthalmia	,	polysyndactyly	,	and	abnormal	head	,	sternum	,	and	neural	tube	,	whereas	Tctn3	heterozygous	KO	mice	did	not	show	abnormal	development	or	behaviors	.	.
s3551	Of	the	2	204	genes	that	were	mutated	,	cellular_response_to_DNA_damage_stimulus	,	TTN	,	TP53	,	KRAS	,	OBSCN	,	SOX9	,	PCDH17	,	SIGLEC10	,	MYH6	,	and	BRD9	were	consistent	with	genes	being	an	early	driver	of	carcinogenesis	,	in	that	they	were	mutated	in	multiple	adenomas	and	multiple	carcinomas	.	.
s2788	Here	we	report	a	complex	form	of	HSP	associated	with	retinal_dystrophy_and	a	pattern	of	neurodegeneration	with	brain	iron	accumulation	(	NBIA	)	on	brain	MRI	,	due	to	a	novel	homozygous	mutation	in	positive_regulation_of_mitochondrial_fission	.	.
s2964	Biallelic	pathogenic	variants	in	ubiquitin	-	dependent_protein_catabolic_process_are	associated	with	an	encephalopathic	mtDNA	maintenance	defect	syndrome	that	is	a	multisystem	disease	characterized	by	lactic	acidemia	,	developmental_delay	,	and	hypotonia	.	.
s335	Complex	recessive	spastic_paraplegias	have	in	the	past	been	frequently	associated	with	mutations	in	SPG11	(	spatacsin	)	,	ZFYVE26/double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination	,	SPG7	(	paraplegin	)	and	a	handful	of	other	rare	genes	,	but	many	cases	remain	genetically	undefined	.	.
s3543	In	these	5	families	,	we	detected	one	reported	and	six	novel	mutations	in	5	different	deafness_autosomal	recessive	(	DFNB	)	genes	(	TRIOBP	,	ion_transport	,	CDH23	,	PCDH15	,	and	MYO7A	)	.	.
s3505	Based	on	the	protein_polyubiquitinationNA	signature	of	bladder	cancer_(BC	)	obtained	by	RNA	sequencing	,	we	focused	on	both	strands	of	the	miR-223-duplex	(	miR-223	-	5p	and	miR-223	-	3p	)	and	investigated	their	functional	significance	in	BC	cells	.	.
s657	Analyses	of	mRNA	profiles	in	comprehensive	datasets	revealed	that	high	heterotypic_cell	-	cell_adhesion_expression	negatively	correlated	with	survival	of	patients	with	both	low-	and	high	-	grade	glioma	.	.

s453	The	individuals	with	prolyl	-	tRNA_aminoacylation_and	NARS2	mutations	,	we	have	reported	here	demonstrate	similar	neurological	features	as	those	previously	reported	,	with	diversity	in	clinical	presentation	such	as	hearing_loss_and	seizure	type	.	.
s1379	The	contiguous	deletion	of	NDP	and	its	neighbouring	genes	,	cellular_biogenic_amine_metabolic_process	/	B	and	EFHC2	,	reportedly	leads	to	syndromic	clinical	features	such	as	microcephaly	,	intellectual_disability	,	and	epilepsy	.	.

s2816	Mutations	in	the	kinesin	family	member	1A	(	anterograde_neuronal_dense_core_vesicle_transport	)	gene	have	been	associated	with	a	wide	range	of	phenotypes	including	recessive	mutations	causing	hereditary	sensory	neuropathy	and	hereditary	spastic_paraplegia_and	de	novo	dominant	mutations	causing	a	more	complex	neurological	disorder	affecting	both	the	central	and	peripheral	nervous	system	.	.
s2780	Herein	we	present	a	case	series	of	six	individuals	(	five	males	,	one	female	)	with	intellectual_disability_and	seizures	found	to	have	alterations	in	modulation_of_chemical_synaptic_transmission	.	.
s423	Importantly	,	we	found	that	CD133	expression	in	glioma_was	highly	correlated	with	the	expression	of	HOX	gene	stem	cell	factors	(	HOXA5	,	HOXA7	,	HOXA10	,	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_and	HOXC6	)	.	.
s2117	By	GEPIA	database	analysis	,	we	also	found	that	the	expression	of	lncRNA	FEZF	-	AS1	and	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_were	significantly	higher	in	tumour_tissues	than	those	of	the	adjacent	non	-	cancerous	tissues	in	969	NSCLC	patients	(	P	AAAA	0.05	)	,	and	lncRNA	FEZF	-	AS1	was	positively	correlated	with	FEZF1	(	r	=	0.90	,	P	AAAA	0.001	)	.	.
s808	Our	study	revealed	that	the	expression	of	WD	repeat	containing	antisense	to	P53	(	telomere_maintenance_via_telomerase	)	is	higher	in	lung	-	adenocarcinoma	specimens	than	in	specimens	from	adjacent	non	-	tumor_tissues	.	.
s3646	Autosomal	dominant	missense	mutations	in	platelet_aggregation_are	associated	with	DFNA20/26	,	a	disorder	that	is	typically	characterized	by	post	-	lingual	progressive	hearing_loss	.	.
s122	Mutations	in	AP5Z1	,	encoding	a	subunit	of	the	AP-5	complex	,	have	been	reported	to	cause	hereditary	spastic_paraplegia_(HSP	)	,	although	their	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_at	the	cellular	level	has	not	been	assessed	.	.
s3231	Therefore	,	STX3	promotes	the	growth	of	breast	cancer_cells	by	regulating	the	PTEN	-	PI3K	-	Akt	-	regulation_of_cell_growth_signaling	.
s1591	These	data	link	microRNA	impairment	to	the	PLAG1-positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_pathway	,	providing	new	insight	into	the	manner	in	which	common	Wilms	tumor_mutations	drive	disease	pathogenesis	.
s2479	Moreover	,	we	observed	an	increase	in	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_expression	in	female	patients	with	distant	metastases	in	tumor_compared	to	adjacent	tissue	.	.

s2552	Expectedly	,	the	analysis	of	the	DEGs	common	to	all	three	alterations	highlighted	a	group	of	BioFunctions	that	included	Cell	Proliferation	of	tumor_cell	lines	(	14	DEGs	)	,	Invasion	of	cells	(	10	DEGs	)	and	Migration	of	tumour	cell	lines	(	10	DEGs	)	,	with	a	common	core	of	5	genes	(	ATF3	,	CDKN1A	,	GDF15	,	HBEGF	and	LCN2	)	that	likely	represent	downstream	effectors	of	the	pro	-	oncogenic	activities	of	phosphorylation	/	AKT	signalling	.	.
s1501	A	replicative	analysis	of	associations	of	15	SNPs	located	in	the	regions	of	11	genes	(	TCF4	,	VRK2	,	mammary_gland_development	,	ZNF804A	,	AGBL1	,	RELN	,	ZFP64P1	,	KCNB2	,	CSMD1	,	CPVL	,	NRIP1	)	and	three	intergenic	regions	(	SLCO6A1/LINCOO491	,	LOC105376248/LOC105376249	,	SPA17/NRGN	)	with	schizophrenia_was	conducted	in	the	Russian	population	of	the	Siberian	region	.	.
s953	In	distal_renal	tubules	,	regulation_of_phosphate_transport_signaling	activates	with	-	no	-	lysine	kinase	4	,	leading	to	increased	renal	tubular	reabsorption	of	calcium	and	sodium	.	.
s1687	Ribosome	profiling	and	RNA	sequencing	identified	IMP1	as	a	principle	node	for	gene	expression	regulation	downstream	from	miRNA_catabolic_process_In	vitro	and	in	vivo	data	demonstrate	that	epithelial	IMP1	loss	increases	expression	of	WNT	target	genes	and	enhances	LIN28B	-	mediated	intestinal	tumorigenesis	,	which	was	reversed	when	we	overexpressed	IMP1	independently	in	vivo	.	.
s1428	Overexpression	of	many	factors	predicted	poor	prognosis	in	breast	(	EEF1D	,	EEF1E1	,	EEF2	)	and	lung	cancer_(EEF1A2	,	translational_elongation	,	EEF1	G	,	EEF1E1	)	.	.
s442	Regarding	DNA	methylation	,	all	four	nucleosome_disassembly	/	INI1-deficient	tumors	showed	methylation	of	RASSF1	gene	by	means	of	MS	-	MLPA	.	.
s544	Further	mechanistic	studies	showed	that	negative_regulation_of_platelet_aggregation_suppressed	epithelial	-	mesenchymal	transition	(	EMT	)	,	further	inhibited	migration	and	invasion	of	breast	cancer_cells	.	.
s2215	RNA_catabolic_process_deficiency	in	humans	is	associated	with	infant	cystic	leukoencephalopathy	,	which	causes	psychomotor_impairment	,	spasticity	and	epilepsy	.	.
s2277	Our	results	suggest	that	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_functions	as	a	tumor	suppressor	,	regulated	by	miR-3175	in	glioma	.	.
s214	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal	recessive	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy_(SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	translational_termination	/	C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s1063	Here	,	we	applied	this	method	to	identify	differentially	expressed	proteins	(	such	as	coatomer	subunit	beta	2	[	intra	-	Golgi_vesicle	-	mediated_transport	]	)	and	evaluated	the	functions	and	molecular	mechanisms	of	these	proteins	in	prostate	cancer_(PCA	)	cell	proliferation	.	.
s3975	Our	analyses	revealed	that	the	primary	tumor	and	NCC	-	SS1-C1	cell	line	harbored	the	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	-	SSX1	fusion	gene	typical	of	synovial	sarcoma_and	similar	proteomics	profiles	.	.
s1028	Biallelic	mutations	in	these	genes	cause	Fanconi	anemia	(	FA	)	,	characterized	by	malformations	,	bone	marrow	failure	,	chromosome	fragility	,	and	cancer_predisposition	(	BRCA2/FANCD1	and	PALB2/double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination	)	,	or	an	FA	-	like	disease	presenting	a	phenotype	similar	to	FA	but	without	bone	marrow	failure	(	BRCA1/FANCS	)	.	.
s2985	We	reported	a	milder	form	of	intra	-	Golgi_vesicle	-	mediated_transport_defect	showing	Friedreich	s	-	ataxia	-	like	phenotypes	without	hypotonia	,	microcephaly	,	and	short_stature_that	were	observed	in	most	patients	with	COG5	defect	.
s3359	A	recent	syndromic	condition	with	craniofacial	dysmorphisms	,	comprising	congenital	ocular	defect	and	neurodevelopmental_delay_named	Helsmoortel	-	glycoprotein_biosynthetic_process_der	Aa	Syndrome	(	HVDAS	)	(	OMIM#615873	)	,	has	been	described	and	molecularly	defined	,	identifying	pathogenic	mutations	in	the	ADNP	gene	(	OMIM#611386	)	as	biological	cause	.	.
s2716	Recently	,	mitochondrial_transport_recessive	mutations	were	also	found	in	two	sporadic	children	with	hereditary	sensory	-	autonomic	neuropathy_(HSAN	)	.	.
s2239	Application	of	a	PIEZO1	agonist	Yoda1	effectively	induced	Ca2	+	response	and	cation	channel	currents	in	PIEZO1-expressing	peptidyl	-	tyrosine_phosphorylation_(HEK	-	Piezo1	)	cells	and	synovial	sarcoma_SW982	(	SW982	)	cells	.	.
s528	response_to_drug_depletion	also	resulted	in	the	radiosensitization	of	normal	lung	fibroblast	cell	lines	(	HFL1	and	MRC-5	)	,	demonstrating	that	the	effect	is	not	restricted	to	tumor_cells	.	.

s947	320	out	of	578	(	55.4	%	)	ovarian	cancer_cases	had	sodium_ion_transport_amplification	.	.
s466	In	patients	with	thyroid	cancer	,	a	positive	correlation	between	SLC6A9	-	5,2	and	protein_ADP	-	ribosylation-1	was	identified	,	and	low	SLC6A9	-	5,2	expression	was	associated	with	a	worse	prognosis	of	papillary	thyroid	carcinoma	.	.
s1163	Methods	,	Ten	potentially	functional	single	nucleotide	polymorphisms	(	SNPs	)	in	seven	prostate	CSC	marker	genes	,	TACSTD2	,	photoreceptor_cell_maintenance	,	ITGA2	,	POU5F1	,	EZH2	,	PSCA	,	and	CD44	,	were	selected	for	analysis	of	their	association	with	disease	recurrence	by	Kaplan	-	Meier	analysis	and	Cox	regression	in	a	cohort	of	320	patients	with	localized	prostate	cancer_receiving	radical	prostatectomy	.	.
s302	So	far	,	homozygous	or	compound	heterozygous	mutations	in	biological_process_have	been	identified	in	two	Turkish	siblings	and	a	Dutch	girl	,	respectively	,	affected	by	cerebellar_ataxia_and	ID	.	.
s1357	To	further	elucidate	the	molecular	pathophysiology	of	schizophrenia	,	we	have	evaluated	the	genetic	association	of	WDR3	and	protein_glycosylation_in	schizophrenia	.	.
s2682	Genes	harboring	the	most	significant	mutations	include	PCDH9	,	KLHL12	,	DCAF4L1	,	and	VHL	in	sporadic_HBs	,	and	ZNF814	,	DLG2	,	protein	-	containing_complex_assembly	,	PNN	,	and	MUC7	in	familial	HBs	.	.
s3058	In	this	family	,	whole	-	exome	sequencing	yielded	rare	,	simultaneously	heterozygous	variants	in	the	Aicardi	-	Goutieres	syndrome	(	AGS	)	genes	ADAR	and	RNA_catabolic_process_co	-	segregating	with	the	tumor_phenotype	.	.
s1337	Here	we	show	that	the	microphthalmia	-	associated	transcription	factor	,	positive_regulation_of_gene_expression	,	which	plays	a	central	role	in	the	development	and	function	of	RPE	cells	,	regulates	the	expression	of	two	visual	cycle	genes	,	Rlbp1	which	encodes	retinaldehyde	binding	protein-1	(	RLBP1	)	,	and	Rdh5	,	which	encodes	retinol	dehydrogenase-5	(	RDH5	)	.	.
s656	We	identified	integrin	a7	(	heterotypic_cell	-	cell_adhesion	)	as	a	major	laminin	receptor	in	GSCs	and	in	primary	high	-	grade	glioma_specimens	.	.
s809	The	prevalence	of	telomere_maintenance_via_telomerase_overexpression	was	significantly	higher	in	patients	with	tumor_larger	than	3.0	cm	than	in	patients	with	tumor	smaller	than	3.0	cm	.	.
s3675	Transcriptomic	analysis	revealed	significant	alterations	in	a	number	of	genes	associated	with	autism	,	such	as	AMP_biosynthetic_process	,	mbd5	,	shank3	,	and	tsc1b	.	.
s3596	RESULTS	IHC	showed	high	levels	of	expression	of	S100A8	protein	in	endometrial_carcinoma_tissues	,	and	establishment_of_mitotic_spindle_orientation-1A	adenocarcinoma	cells	(	in	G1	and	G2	)	.	.
s2340	Mutations	in	the	POU	class	4	transcription	factor	3	(	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	)	are	known	to	cause	autosomal	dominant	nonsyndromic	hearing_loss_linked	to	the	loci	of	DFNA15	.	.
s1218	BACKGROUND	Ellis	-	glycoprotein_biosynthetic_process_Creveld	syndrome	is	an	autosomal_recessive_chondro	-	ectodermal	dysplasia	characterized	by	disproportionate	short	stature	,	limb	shortening	,	narrow	chest	,	postaxial	polydactyly	and	dysplastic	nails	and	teeth	.	.
s3656	Western	blot	analysis	,	real	-	time	PCR	,	MTT	assay	and	flow	cytometric	analysis	were	performed	and	the	results	demonstrated	that	compared	with	the	gastric	cancer_SGC-7901	cells	,	the	expression	of	NIBP	,	peripheral_nervous_system_development	-	kB	p65	,	NF	-	kB	p	-	p65	and	mesenchymal	marker	vimentin	were	significantly	increased	in	gastric	cancer	multidrug	-	resistant	SGC-7901/CDDP	cells	,	and	the	epithelial	cell	marker	ZO-1	was	significantly	decreased	.	.
s3867	Allelic	heterogeneity_was	observed	at	LRRK2	while	European	risk	SNPs	at	6	other	loci	including	MAPT	and	negative_regulation_of_protein_homooligomerization	-	SYT11	were	non	-	polymorphic	or	very	rare	in	our	cohort	.	.
s3895	We	found	monoallelic	truncating	/	functionally	deleterious	mutations	in	seven	genes	,	including	protein_phosphorylation_and	CHEK2	,	which	have	previously	been	associated	with	PrCa	predisposition	,	and	five	new	candidate	PrCa	associated	genes	involved	in	cancer_predisposing	recessive	disorders	,	namely	RAD51C	,	FANCD2	,	FANCI	,	CEP57	and	RECQL4	.	.
s1261	The	expression	of	uncarboxylated	MGP	(	ucMGP	)	,	carboxylated	MGP	(	cMGP	)	,	matrix	metalloproteinase	(	MMP)-13	,	collagen	type	X	,	collagen	type	II	,	tumor_necrosis	factor	(	protein_import_into_nucleus,_translocation)-a	and	interleukin	(	IL)-1b	were	detected	by	ELISA	,	immunohistochemistry	,	reverse	transcription	-	quantitative	polymerase	chain	reaction	and	western	blotting	.	.
s3447	An	abnormality	in	the	miRNA_catabolic_process	/	let-7a	axis	is	relevant	to	the	progression	of	hepatitis	B	virus	(	HBV)-positive	hepatocellular	carcinoma	(	HCC	)	,	which	could	be	a	novel	therapeutic	target	for	this	malignant	tumor	.	.
s3077	These	results	indicate	that	regulation_of_neuronal_action_potential_has	a	potential	role	in	ESCC	and	suggest	that	cancer_genomic	datasets	with	application	of	in	silico	approaches	are	instrumental	for	biomarker	discovery	research	broadly	and	specifically	,	for	the	identification	of	FGF12	as	a	putative	biomarker	in	ESCC	.
s1614	Analysis	of	the	adult	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_mutant	kidney	also	showed	proximal	tubule	dysgenesis	and	nephrocalcinosis	.	.
s166	Mutations	in	the	ALS5/SPG11/chemical_synaptic_transmission_gene	are	a	frequent	cause	of	autosomal_recessive_hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	peripheral	axonal	neuropathy	,	and	account	for	a	40	%	of	autosomal	recessive	juvenile	amyotrophic	lateral	sclerosis	.	.
s2577	A	decreased	gene	expression	(	RQ	AAAA	0.7	)	was	observed	for	negative_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_in	60.9	%	of	tumour_samples	,	for	MLH1	in	50.7	%	and	for	TUSC4	in	26	%	of	NSCLC	samples	.	.
s487	Recently	,	mutations	in	biological_process_were	reported	in	two	maternal	half	-	brothers	,	presenting	with	nephrocalcinosis	,	midface	hypoplasia	and	,	in	one	of	the	siblings	,	deafness_and	elliptocytosis	.	.
s1269	Here	,	we	describe	a	double	-	retargeting	strategy	,	based	on	the	simultaneous	insertion	of	two	ligands	in	gD	,	one	for	retargeting	to	a	producer	,	universal	Vero	cell	derivative	and	one	for	retargeting	to	the	signal_transduction_cancer_receptor	.	.
s3496	Twenty	-	eight	days	after	nude	mice	intraperitoneal	injection	with	JTE-013	or	PBS	,	the	mice	were	sacrificed	and	the	number	and	the	weight	of	vimelanosome_organizationble	tumors	were	calculated	.	.
s2205	The	role	of	regulation_of_inflammatory_response_in	breast	cancer_provides	a	novel	insight	into	the	clinical	application	of	the	USP18/AKT	/	Skp2	pathway	.
s3871	Our	findings	indicate	that	mutations	in	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_cause	a	genetic	neurodevelopmental	syndrome	and	suggest	that	loss	of	EBF3	function	might	mediate	a	subset	of	neurologic	phenotypes	shared	by	ARX	-	related	disorders	,	including	intellectual_disability	,	abnormal	genitalia	,	and	structural	CNS	malformations	.
s786	In	two	different	patients	with	unilateral_cryptorchidism	,	we	found	the	variants	rs121912556	and	p	.	R105R	of	positive_regulation_of_epithelial_cell_migration_gene	in	a	heterozygous	form	associated	with	cryptorchidism	,	so	we	could	considered	them	as	risk	factors	for	cryptorchidism	.	.
s500	While	polyglutamine	ataxias	,	linked	to	CAG	repeat	expansions	in	genes	such	as	ATXN1	,	ATXN2	,	ATXN3	,	ATXN7	,	CACNA1A	and	transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	have	been	extensively	characterized	in	large	cohorts	,	there	is	a	need	for	comprehensive	assessment	of	frequency	and	phenotype	of	more	_	conventional	_	ataxias	.	.
s2781	Herein	we	present	a	case	series	of	six	individuals	(	five	males	,	one	female	)	with	intellectual	disability	and	seizures_found	to	have	alterations	in	modulation_of_chemical_synaptic_transmission	.	.
s3655	Moreover	,	the	overexpression	of	cerebral_cortex_development_was	closely	related	to	tumor_differentiation	,	depth	of	invasion	,	clinical	stage	and	lymphatic	metastasis	in	gastric	cancer	.	.
s1894	Heterozygous	de	novo	sodium_ion_transmembrane_transport_missense	variants	in	the	S5/S6	pore	-	forming	segments	lead	to	congenital	contractures_of	the	limbs	and	face	,	hypotonia	,	and	developmental	delay	(	CLIFAHDD	,	OMIM	616266	)	with	some	clinical	overlap	.	.
s3568	Most	of	the	genes	that	are	commonly	associated	with	colon	cancer	,	including	APC	,	TP53	,	and	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	,	were	all	classified	as	being	early	driver	genes	being	mutated	in	both	adenomas	and	carcinomas	.	.
s39	In	zebrafish	,	downregulation	of	negative_regulation_of_phosphatase_activity_expression	leads	to	an	abnormal_eye_phenotype	and	defective	light	-	induced	locomotor	response	.	.
s892	On	the	other	hand	,	patients	carrying	either	deletions	encompassing	solely	odontogenesis_of_dentin	-	containing_tooth_or	its	loss	-	of	-	function	variants	were	reported	in	association	with	the	KBG	syndrome	,	characterized	by	a	very	similar	phenotype	,	including	mild	-	to	-	moderate	intellectual_disability	,	short	stature	and	macrodontia	of	upper	incisors	,	with	inter	and	intrafamilial	variability	.	.
s1193	In	particular	,	angiogenesis_mutations	result	in	congenital	macrothrombocytopenia_and	predispose	to	kidney	failure	,	hearing	loss	,	and	cataracts	,	MPL	and	MECOM	mutations	cause	congenital	thrombocytopenia	evolving	into	bone	marrow	failure	,	whereas	thrombocytopenias	caused	by	RUNX1	,	ANKRD26	,	and	ETV6	mutations	are	characterized	by	predisposition	to	hematological	malignancies	.	.
s1863	Haploinsufficiency	of	the	chromatin	remodeling	factor	chromatin	-	mediated_maintenance_of_transcription_leads	to	autism_spectrum	disorder	and	intellectual	disability	.	.
s3320	Thus	,	upregulation	of	this	protein_polyubiquitinationNA	to	selectively	increase	osteoclast	-	like	activity	in	calcified	vessels	of	CKD	-	MBD	could	alleviate	vascular_calcification_without	altering	bone	structure	.
s2785	An	accurate	spatial	and	temporal	control	of	NL	-	negative_regulation_of_Wnt_signaling_pathway_signaling	is	crucial	to	balance	excitatory	and	inhibitory	neurotransmission	,	and	perturbations	are	linked	with	neurodevelopmental	and	psychiatric_disorders	.	.
s3587	Furthermore	,	in	cultured	human	BMSCs	,	TGF	-	a	stimulated	production	of	procancer_cytokines	including	IL-6	,	VEGF	,	activation_of_MAPK_activity	,	FGF17	,	and	TGF	-	b1	in	a	dose	-	dependent	manner	.	.
s1706	Lately	,	ARMC5	was	linked	to	the	cyclic	AMP	signaling	pathway	,	which	could	be	implicated	in	all	of	mechanisms	of	cortisol	-	secreting	by	macronodules	adrenal_hyperplasia_and	the	molecular	defects	in	,	G	protein	aberrant	receptors	,	MC2R	,	GNAS	,	PRKAR1A	,	negative_regulation_of_cGMP	-	mediated_signaling	,	PDE8B.	.
s607	Genes	with	DMRs	were	involved	in	inflammatory	response	(	IRAK4	and	ESM1	)	,	cancer_(BRCA1	and	ion_transport	)	,	endocrine	function	(	CNPY1	)	,	and	male	fertility	(	IFT140	,	TESC	,	and	PRDM8	)	.	.
s3494	Immunohistochemically	,	the	tumor_cells	were	positive	for	S-100	protein	(	4/4	)	,	SOX10(3/4	)	,	Langerin	/	CD207(4/4	)	,	CD1a(3/4	)	,	CD68(3/4	)	,	CD163(3/4	)	,	and	mRNA_splicing,_via_spliceosome-1(4/4	)	.	.
s187	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal_recessive_Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy	(	SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/ceramide_biosynthetic_process	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s3808	The	tumor_cells	resembled	pro	-	B	cells	,	and	were	CD19+IgM	-	IgD	-	CD93+CD43+CD21-CD23-VpreB+CXCR4	+	Consistent	with	the	pro	-	B	-	cell	stage	of	B	-	cell	development	,	microarray	analysis	revealed	enrichment	of	transcripts	,	including	V(D)J_recombination	,	Rag2	,	CD93	,	Vpreb1	,	Vpreb3	,	and	Igll1	We	confirmed	RAG1	expression	in	Tg26	tumors	,	and	hypothesized	that	HIV-1	matrix	protein	p17	may	directly	induce	RAG1	in	B	cells	.	.
s1496	We	have	revealed	significant	association	of	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_and	MAP3K1	polymorphisms	with	breast	cancer	.	.
s612	On	the	other	hand	,	MYH1	,	MYH2	,	skeletal_muscle_contraction	,	MYH7	,	MYH8	,	FOXO3	,	NFATC1	,	PTGS2	,	KAT6B	,	HDAC4	,	and	RUNX2	expression	is	suspected	to	be	involved	in	the	epigenetic	regulations	behind	the	mandibular	prognathism_phenotype	.
s914	We	report	here	that	t	-	butyl	alcohol	,	which	is	neither	a	substrate	nor	an	inhibitor	of	alcohol	dehydrogenases	or	monoterpenoid_metabolic_process	,	is	a	potent	inducer	of	holoprosencephaly_in	Cdon	mutant	mice	.	.
s2307	Homozygous	recessive	mutations	in	the	protein_import_into_nucleus_gene	were	first	described	in	three	consanguineous	families	with	myoclonic	epilepsy	.	.
s1929	Heterozygous	mutations	of	the	Forkhead	-	box	protein	2	(	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	)	gene	in	humans	cause	childhood	apraxia_of_speech	.	.
s97	This	report	describes	the	first	putative	mutations	,	p	.	L70P	and	p	.	R450C	,	in	the	coding	region	of	the	histidine_catabolic_process_gene	in	a	girl	with	urocanic	aciduria	presenting	with	mental	retardation	and	intermittent	ataxia	.	.
s3917	To	evaluate	whether	germline	variants	in	genes	encoding	pancreatic	secretory	enzymes	contribute	to	pancreatic	cancer_susceptibility	,	we	sequenced	the	coding	regions	of	proteolysis_and	other	genes	encoding	pancreatic	secretory	enzymes	and	known	pancreatitis	susceptibility	genes	(	PRSS1	,	CPA1	,	CTRC	,	and	SPINK1	)	in	a	hospital	series	of	pancreatic	cancer	cases	and	controls	.	.
s2773	GO	exhibits	an	autosomal_recessive_inheritance_pattern	and	is	caused	by	loss	-	of	-	function	mutations	in	hair_follicle_morphogenesis	,	which	encodes	a	protein	important	for	Golgi	-	related	transport	.	.
s1437	The	use	of	recombinant	human	erythropoietin	(	defense_response_to_bacterium	)	has	consistently	been	shown	to	reduce	the	need	for	blood	transfusions	and	to	increase	hemoglobin	levels	in	lung	cancer_patients	with	chemotherapy	-	induced	anemia	.	.
s525	A	homozygous	splice	acceptor	site	variant	(	c.395	-	1GAAAAA	)	was	identified	in	the	limb_morphogenesis_gene	,	which	completely	co	-	segregated	with	post	-	axial_polydactyly	phenotype	within	the	family	.	.
s2836	Although	DNA_strand_renaturationR2	has	been	linked	to	human	cancer	,	its	role	in	cervical	cancer	remains	unknown	.	.
s1830	Studies	in	humans	with	autosomal	recessive	positive_regulation_of_stress	-	activated_MAPK_cascade_deficiency	have	indicated	a	highly	specific	role	for	this	molecule	in	the	activation	of	antifungal	immune	responses	in	the	central_nervous	system	,	the	oral	mucosa	,	and	the	skin	.	.
s483	In	this	study	,	we	report	a	family	with	X	-	linked	recessive	syndrome	caused	by	mutated	biological_process_and	characterized	by	elliptocytosis	with	or	without	anemia	,	midface	hypoplasia	,	proportionate	short	stature	and	hearing_loss	.	.
s2190	The	tumor_suppressor	protein_polyubiquitination-145	has	been	reported	to	be	lowly	expressed	in	numerous	types	of	human	cancer	,	in	the	present	study	,	the	expression	levels	of	miR-145	were	decreased	in	patients	with	NSCLC	.	.
s797	Mutations	in	the	proline	dehydrogenase	gene	positive_regulation_of_cell_death_are	linked	to	behavioral	alterations	in	schizophrenia_and	as	part	of	DiGeorge	and	velo	-	cardio	-	facial	syndromes	,	but	the	role	of	PRODH	in	their	etiology	remains	unclear	.	.
s1198	In	particular	,	MYH9	mutations	result	in	congenital	macrothrombocytopenia_and	predispose	to	kidney	failure	,	hearing	loss	,	and	cataracts	,	MPL	and	MECOM	mutations	cause	congenital	thrombocytopenia	evolving	into	bone	marrow	failure	,	whereas	thrombocytopenias	caused	by	RUNX1	,	ANKRD26	,	and	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_mutations	are	characterized	by	predisposition	to	hematological	malignancies	.	.
s3022	We	observed	that	the	alternatively	spliced	transcripts	of	a	subset	of	these	genes	,	involved	in	proliferation	and	tumor_cell	migration	like	DNA_replication	/	AP4	,	ST3GAL6	,	TRNAU1AP	and	PFKM	are	degraded	upon	loss	of	PRMT5	.	.
s761	Mutations	in	one	of	our	candidate	genes	,	striated_muscle_contraction	,	have	been	reported	as	the	cause	of	X	-	linked	deafness_in	humans	.	.
s3834	Blocking	the	expression	of	integrin	a2b1	,	which	was	accomplished	by	transduction	of	a2-specific	shRNA	,	resulted	in	significant	inhibition	of	proliferation	and	clonal	activity	in	human	MCF-7	breast_carcinoma_and	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	-	Mel-147	melanoma	cells	.	.
s127	In	this	study	,	we	investigated	the	expression	of	the	cancer	/	testis	antigens	ADAM2	,	CALR3	and	snRNA_3'-end_processing_in	lung	and	breast	cancer	,	the	two	most	frequent	human	cancers	,	with	the	purpose	of	providing	novel	therapeutic	targets	for	these	diseases	.	.
s474	In	this	study	,	we	employed	whole	-	exome	sequencing	and	identified	a	homozygous	missense	mutation	c.1522C	AAAA	A	(	p	.	Pro508Thr	)	in	the	mitotic_cytokinesis_gene	as	the	cause	of	autosomal_recessive_APH	in	an	Indian	family	.	.
s3443	Germline	mutations	in	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination_are	associated	with	increased	risk	of	breast	and	ovarian	cancer_and	BRCA1	deficient	tumors	are	exquisitely	sensitive	to	poly	(	ADP	-	ribose	)	polymerase	(	PARP	)	inhibitors	.	.
s3139	RNA	was	extracted	from	thirteen	canine	meningiomas	-	eleven	from	formalin	fixed	and	two	activation_of_cysteine	-	type_endopeptidase_activity_involved_in_apoptotic_process	-	frozen	.	.
s451	Moreover	,	it	is	known	that	asparaginyl	-	tRNA_aminoacylation_mutations	cause	various	clinical	phenotypes	,	including	non	-	syndromic	hearing_loss	,	Leigh	syndrome	,	intellectual	disability	with	epilepsy	and	severe	myopathy	.	.
s3044	This	finding	provides	concrete	evidence	that	inhibition	of	both	tricarboxylic_acid_cycle_and	MDH2	may	provide	a	valuable	platform	for	developing	novel	therapeutics	that	target	cancer	metabolism	and	tumor_growth	.
s3997	In	particular	,	MYH9	mutations	result	in	congenital	macrothrombocytopenia	and	predispose	to	kidney	failure	,	hearing_loss	,	and	cataracts	,	MPL	and	MECOM	mutations	cause	congenital	thrombocytopenia	evolving	into	bone	marrow	failure	,	whereas	thrombocytopenias	caused	by	RUNX1	,	ANKRD26	,	and	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_mutations	are	characterized	by	predisposition	to	hematological	malignancies	.	.
s3837	Here	,	we	have	identified	two	novel	and	rare	heterozygous	variants	in	the	neural_crest_cell_migration_and	DPT	genes	segregating	with	the	complete	phenotype	that	have	variable_expressivity_in	two	pedigrees	with	AD	-	FMD	.	.
s2959	They	also	provide	the	proof	-	of	-	concept	that	expression	of	the	neuropathy	-	associated	phosphatidylinositol_dephosphorylation_gene	improves	the	MTM1-associated	myopathy	,	thus	identifying	MTMR2	as	a	novel	therapeutic	target	for	myotubular	myopathy	.
s3076	Silencing	of	regulation_of_neuronal_action_potential_showed	significant	inhibition	in	activity	of	tumor_cell	proliferation	,	colony	formation	,	and	cell	migration	.	.
s3129	Mutations	in	muscle_contraction_are	associated	with	skeletal	myopathies	,	characterized	by	ophthalmoplegia	.	.
s3278	Then	,	the	role	of	PSMB8	in	migration	and	proliferation	of	glioma_cells	was	investigated	by	conducting	wound	-	healing	,	trans	-	well	assay	,	cell	counting	kit	(	neuron_migration)-8	,	flow	cytometry	assay	and	colony	formation	analysis	.	.
s405	Mutations	in	the	sarcomere_organization_gene	have	been	identified	in	patients	with	Z	-	disc	-	associated	,	alternatively	spliced	,	PDZ	motif	-	containing	protein	(	ZASP)-related	myofibrillar	myopathy	(	ZASP	-	MFM	)	characterized	by	late	-	onset	distal	myopathy	with	signs	of	cardiomyopathy	and	neuropathy	.	.
s2095	The	relationship	between	the	altered	expression	of	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	c	-	MET	,	and	NM23-H1	and	pathological	microenvironmental	features	,	including	the	presence	of	tumor_budding	and	desmoplasia	,	were	assessed	.	.
s855	Metabolic	cutis	laxa	results	from	Menkes	syndrome	,	caused	by	a	defect	in	the	ATPase	copper	transporting	alpha	(	ATP7A	)	gene	,	congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	due	to	mutations	in	subunit	7	of	the	component	of	oligomeric	Golgi	(	COG7)-congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	(	CDG	)	complex	,	combined	disorder	of	N-	and	O	-	linked	glycosylation	,	due	to	mutations	in	ATPase	H+	transporting	V0	subunit	a2	(	ATP6VOA2	)	gene	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	reductase	1	deficiency	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	synthase	deficiency	,	macrocephaly	,	alopecia	,	cutis	laxa	,	and	scoliosis	(	MACS	)	syndrome	,	due	to	Ras	and	Rab	interactor	2	(	RIN2	)	mutations	,	transaldolase	deficiency	caused	by	mutations	in	the	transaldolase	1	(	TALDO1	)	gene	,	Gerodermia	osteodysplastica	due	to	mutations	in	the	golgin	,	RAB6-interacting	(	GORAB	or	SCYL1BP1	)	gene	,	and	mitogen	-	activated	pathway	(	MAP	)	kinase	defects	,	caused	by	mutations	in	several	genes	[	protein	tyrosine	phosphatase	,	non	-	receptor	-	type	11	(	PTPN11	)	,	RAF	,	NF	,	HRas	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	HRAS	)	,	B	-	Raf	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	BRAF	)	,	activation_of_MAPK_activity/2	,	KRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	KRAS	)	,	SOS	Ras	/	Rho	guanine	nucleotide	exchange	factor	2	(	SOS2	)	,	leucine	rich	repeat	scaffold	protein	(	SHOC2	)	,	NRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	NRAS	)	,	and	Raf-1	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	RAF1	)	]	,	which	regulate	the	Ras	-	MAPK	cascade	.	.
s3193	Our	cases	confirm	that	cellular_sodium_ion_homeostasis	-	related	neurological	disorders	make	up	a	phenotypic	continuum	rather	than	overlapping	syndromes	,	in	which	early	onset	dystonia	,	ataxia	and	paroxysmal	episodes	with	triggering	or	worsening	factors	are	key	diagnostic	clues	.	.
s1692	Exome	analysis	of	APA	has	allowed	the	identification	of	recurrent	somatic	mutations	in	KCNJ5	,	calcium_ion_transport	,	ATP1A1	,	and	ATP2B3	in	more	than	50	%	of	sporadic_cases	.	.
s2287	From	a	GeneMatcher	-	enabled	international	collaboration	,	we	identified	ten	individuals	affected	by	intellectual	disability	,	speech_delay	,	ataxia	,	and	facial	dysmorphism	and	carrying	a	deleterious	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_variant	detected	by	whole	-	exome	sequencing	.	.
s2971	Biallelic	mutations	in	the	glycerol-3-phosphate_metabolic_process_gene	cause	a	rare	autosomal	recessive	inherited	disease	known	as	transient	infantile	hypertriglyceridemia_(OMIM	#	614480	)	.	.
s3423	Cerebral	autosomal	dominant	arteriopathy	with	subcortical	infarcts	and	leukoencephalopathy_(CADASIL	)	,	caused	by	transcription_initiation_from_RNA_polymerase_II_promoter	,	primarily	affects	small	cerebral	arteries	,	however	,	stenosis	of	major	intracranial	arteries	has	occasionally	been	reported	.	.
s2919	Activation	of	GPER	and	its	downstream	signaling	MAPK	/	ERK	,	not	phosphorylation	/	AKT	,	led	to	enhanced	TRIM2	protein	levels	and	affected	the	binding	between	TRIM2	and	Bim	which	resulted	in	a	reduced	Bim	in	TAM	-	resistant	breast	cancer_cells	.	.
s2191	Although	the	role	of	regulation_of_inflammatory_response_in	breast	cancer_cell	lines	has	been	elucidated	,	the	underlying	mechanisms	and	clinical	role	of	USP18	in	breast	cancer	are	currently	not	well	understood	.	.
s2248	Furthermore	,	we	investigated	whether	there	is	an	association	between	the	mRNA	and	protein	expression	levels	of	protein_polyubiquitination	,	RNF31	and	SHARPIN	and	clinicopathological	parameters	including	estrogen	receptor	(	ER	)	,	progesterone	receptor	(	PR	)	and	human	epidermal	growth	factor	receptor	(	HER2	)	status	and	found	that	RNF31	protein	is	significantly	higher	in	ERalpha	-	negative	tumors	than	ERalpha	-	positive	tumors	(	p	=	0.034	)	.	.
s669	Bardet	-	Biedl	syndrome	(	visual_perception	)	is	a	genetically	heterogeneous	disorder	characterized	by	retinal	dystrophy	,	polydactyly	,	obesity	,	developmental	delay	,	and	renal	defects	.	.
s2639	Tumors	showing	this	phenotype	,	but	no	alterations	in	the	known	predisposing	genes	,	could	harbor	mutations	in	other	Krebs	cycle	genes	.	Experimental	Design	,	We	used	downregulation	and	methylation	of	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	,	as	a	marker	of	a	hypermethylation	phenotype	,	to	select	eleven	pheochromocytomas	and	paragangliomas_for	targeted	exome	sequencing	of	a	panel	of	Krebs	cycle	-	related	genes	.	.
s1047	Mutations	in	genes	involved	in	the	biosynthesis	of	the	glycosylphosphatidylinositol	(	glucosamine_catabolic_process	)	anchor	cause	autosomal	recessive	glycosylation	defects	,	with	a	wide	phenotypic	spectrum	of	intellectual	disability	,	seizures	,	minor	facial	dysmorphism	,	hypotonia	,	and	elevated	serum	alkaline	phosphatase	.	.
s2059	Overall	,	these	data	support	a	tumor_suppressive	role	for	protein_polyubiquitination-125a	and	contribute	to	the	elucidation	of	its	molecular	targets	.
s3329	Our	analyses	revealed	that	the	primary	tumor	and	NCC	-	SS1-negative_regulation_of_cell_migration_cell	line	harbored	the	SS18-SSX1	fusion	gene	typical	of	synovial	sarcoma_and	similar	proteomics	profiles	.	.
s2755	Our	results	not	only	identified	the	etiology	of	MICPCH	in	nearly	all	the	investigated	patients	but	also	suggest	that	MICPCH	is	a	genetically	heterogeneous_condition	,	in	which	negative_regulation_of_keratinocyte_proliferation_inactivating	mutations	appear	to	account	for	the	majority	of	cases	.
s3045	Taken	together	,	proteasome	-	mediated_ubiquitin	-	dependent_protein_catabolic_process_was	identified	as	a	potential	gene	that	plays	a	role	in	the	development	of	tamoxifen	resistance	in	breast	cancer_cells	.	.
s593	Gene	-	based	tests	highlighted	20	additional	genes	of	which	5	had	previously	been	associated	to	schizophrenia	and/or	bipolar_disorder	,	CSMD1	,	CCDC141	,	SLC1A2	,	CACNA1C	,	and	exocytosis	.	.
s1202	In	particular	,	angiogenesis_mutations	result	in	congenital	macrothrombocytopenia	and	predispose	to	kidney	failure	,	hearing	loss	,	and	cataracts	,	MPL	and	MECOM	mutations	cause	congenital	thrombocytopenia	evolving	into	bone	marrow	failure	,	whereas	thrombocytopenias	caused	by	RUNX1	,	ANKRD26	,	and	ETV6	mutations	are	characterized	by	predisposition	to	hematological	malignancies	.	.
s2655	We	addressed	this	issue	using	mouse	pancreatic	acinar	tumor_cell	line	266	-	6	and	primary	PAC	of	wild	-	type	and	transgenic	mice	carrying	the	thiamine_pyrophosphate_transmembrane_transport_promoter	that	were	fed	alcohol	chronically	.	.
s3622	For	families	that	neuromuscular_process_controlling_posture_mutations	were	not	detected	by	Sanger	sequencing	,	candidate	gene	mutations	were	further	screened	by	next	-	generation	sequencing	for	epilepsy	.	.
s1869	The	protein	expression	of	activation_of_NF	-	kappaB	-	inducing_kinase_activity_and	downstream	molecules	tumor_necrosis	factor	receptor	-	associated	factor	6	(	TRAF6	)	,	inhibitor	of	nuclear	factor	kappa	-	B	kinase	(	IKK	)	,	NF	-	kappa	-	B	inhibitor	alpha	(	IKBa	)	,	and	NF	-	kB	was	detected	by	Western	-	blot	analysis	.	.
s3000	The	transcription	factor	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_is	a	master	regulator	of	the	cellular	antioxidant	response	,	and	it	is	often	genetically	activated	in	non	-	small	-	cell	lung	cancers	(	NSCLCs	)	by	,	for	instance	,	mutations	in	the	negative	regulator	KEAP1	.	.
s2488	Humans	who	carry	kidney_development_mutations	develop	heterogeneous	renal	abnormalities	,	including	multicystic	dysplastic	kidneys	,	glomerulocystic	kidney	disease	,	renal_agenesis	,	renal	hypoplasia	,	and	renal	interstitial	fibrosis	.	.
s3786	Zebrafish	with	ryroxD1	knock	-	down	recapitulate	features	of	cellular_response_to_oxidative_stress_myopathy_with	sarcomeric	disorganization	,	myofibrillar	aggregates	,	and	marked	swimming	defect	.	.
s1757	In	conclusion	,	glycerol	phosphate	formation	for	de	novo	GPL	synthesis	via	glyceroneogenesis	is	a	newly	characterized	anabolic	pathway	in	cancer_cells	mediated	by	pyruvate_metabolic_process	-	M	under	conditions	of	severe	nutrient	deprivation	.
s1910	An	increasing	number	of	studies	suggest	that	long	-	noncoding	RNAs	(	lncRNAs	)	play	important	roles	in	various	biological	processes	and	disease	pathologies	,	including	cancer	.	We	analyzed	the	expression	profiles	of	lncRNA	,	miRNA	,	and	mRNA	,	along	with	the	clinical	information	of	intracellular_signal_transduction_patients	collected	from	the	Cancer	Genome	Atlas	database	to	identify	lncRNA	biomarkers	for	prognosis	.	.
s2789	This	observation	enlarges	the	clinical	spectrum	of	positive_regulation_of_mitochondrial_fission	-	associated	disorders	and	sheds	light	on	a	new	aetiology	for	syndromes	associating	retinopathy_and	NBIA	.	.
s282	The	best	candidate	causal	variants	for	ER(-	)	tumors	lie	in	four	separate	enhancer	elements	,	and	their	risk	alleles	reduce	expression	of	transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	RMND1	and	CCDC170	,	whereas	the	risk	alleles	of	the	strongest	candidates	for	the	remaining	independent	causal	variant	disrupt	a	silencer	element	and	putatively	increase	ESR1	and	RMND1	expression	.	.
s1785	Anthocyanin	consumption	is	linked	to	benefits	in	obesity	-	related	metabolic	alterations	and	non	-	alcoholic	fatty	liver	disease	(	NAFLD	)	,	though	the	functional	role	of	delphinidin	(	inflammatory_response	)	is	yet	to	be	established	.	.
s1323	Fourteen	different	(	half	of	them	novel	)	non	-	GJB2	variants	causing	HL	were	found	in	10	genes	(	CHD7	,	HDAC8	,	MITF	,	NEFL	,	OTOF	,	SF3B4	,	SLC26A4	,	TECTA	,	regulation_of_gene_expression	,	USH2A	)	among	13	probands	,	confirming	the	genetic	heterogeneity_of	hereditary	HL	.	.
s3673	In	addition	,	resorcinol	suppressed	the	expression	of	melanogenic	gene	microphthalmia	-	associated	transcriptional	factor	(	positive_regulation_of_gene_expression	)	and	its	downstream	target	genes	tyrosinase	,	tyrosinase	-	related	protein	(	TRP)-1	,	and	TRP-2	.	.
s2149	A	previous	study	showed	that	treatment	with	resveratrol	inhibits	muscular_atrophy_in	mdx	mice	,	a	model	of	peptide_biosynthetic_process	.	.
s3731	The	PCH1sub	-	types	with	early	death	(	between	ages	1	day	and	17	months	)	,	seen	in	patients	with	p	.	G31A	/	EXOSC3	or	SLC25A46	mutations	have	a	spliceosomal_snRNP_assembly_type	1-like	clinical	presentation	but	with	global	developmental	delay	,	visual	and	hearing	impairment	,	with	or	without	microcephaly	,	nystagmus	and	optic	atrophy	.	.
s3793	Oral	cancer_was	associated	with	two	new	regions	,	2p23.3	(	rs6547741	,	GPN1	)	and	9q34.12	(	rs928674	,	LAMC3	)	,	and	with	known	cancer	-	related	loci-9p21.3	(	rs8181047	,	CDKN2B	-	AS1	)	and	5p15.33	(	rs10462706	,	apoptotic_process	)	.	.
s3344	This	review	highlights	recent	advances	in	understanding	how	the	OVOL1-positive_regulation_of_gene_expression_axis	modulates	cell	differentiation	and	proliferation	in	human	keratinocytes	,	hair	follicles	,	and	benign	or	malignant	skin	tumors	including	squamous	cell	carcinoma	and	malignant_melanoma	.	.
s2737	In	addition	,	4/18	(	18	%	)	of	intraductal	tubulopapillary	neoplasms	had	FGFR2	fusions	(	FGFR2-CEP55	,	FGFR2-SASS6	,	DISP1-FGFR2	,	FGFR2-cytokine	-	mediated_signaling_pathway	,	and	FGFR2-VCL	)	and	1/18	(	5.5	%	)	had	STRN	-	ALK	fusion	.	.
s3366	Lamb	-	Shaffer	syndrome	(	OMIM	,	616803	)	is	a	neurodevelopmental	disorder	characterized	by	developmental_delay	,	mild	to	moderate	intellectual	disability	,	speech	delay	,	and	mild	characteristic	facial	appearance	caused	by	positive_regulation_of_chondrocyte_differentiation_haploinsufficiency	on	chromosome	12p12.1	.	.
s3071	We	show	that	loss	of	the	Drosophila	long-/very	-	long	-	chain	acyl	-	CoA	synthetase	genes	bgm	and/or	dbb	is	indistinguishable	from	loss	of	the	Drosophila	ABC	transporter	gene	ABCD	Shared	loss	-	of	-	function	phenotypes	for	synthetase	and	transporter	mutants	point	to	a	lipid	metabolic	pathway	association	with	fatty_acid_beta	-	oxidation	-	like	neurodegenerative_disease_in	Drosophila	,	a	pathway	association	that	has	yet	to	be	established	in	humans	.	.
s4027	The	staining	intensity	of	dolichol	-	linked_oligosaccharide_biosynthetic_process_was	significantly	correlated	to	the	tumor_grade	(	grades	2	-	3	versus	1	,	pAAAA0.05	)	.	.
s4001	In	this	study	,	we	evaluated	the	effect	of	regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_inactivation	on	biologic	behavior	of	primary	(	Caco-2	)	and	metastatic	colon	cancer_cells	(	LoVo	and	SNU407	)	and	the	relation	of	p	-	STAT3	expression	with	the	invasion	of	colon	tumor	.	.
s1003	Knockdown	of	PPP2R1B	expression	increases	AKT	phosphorylation	,	which	leads	to	elevated	XIAP	expression	and	enhanced	5-FU	resistance	,	whereas	rescue	of	PPP2R1B	expression	in	protein_polyubiquitination-587-expressing	cells	decreases	AKT	phosphorylation	/	XIAP	expression	,	re	-	sensitizing	colon	cancer_cells	to	5-FU	-	induced	apoptosis	.	.
s4048	Furthermore	,	parallel	immunohistochemical	analysis	of	three	PP2A	inhibitors	demonstrated	that	two	PP2A	inhibitors	,	CIP2A	and	SET	,	are	highly	expressed	in	both	dysplastic	and	adenocarcinomatous	tumors	of	the	nuclear	-	transcribed_mRNA_poly(A)_tail_shortening	-	Tag	mice	.	.
s561	Recent	GWAS	completed	for	three	types	of	common	adult	-	onset	glaucoma_have	identified	novel	loci	for	POAG	(	primary	-	open	-	angle	glaucoma	)	(	ABCA1	,	AFAP1	,	GMDS	,	PMM2	,	TGFBR3	,	FNDC3B	,	ARHGEF12	,	GAS7	,	FOXC1	,	ATXN2	,	TXNRD2	)	,	PACG	(	primary	angle	-	closure	glaucoma	(	EPDR1	,	CHAT	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	FERMT2	,	DPM2-FAM102	)	,	and	exfoliation	syndrome	(	XFS	)	glaucoma	(	CACNA1A	)	.	.
s3766	The	deficiency	of	3-methycrotonyl	-	CoA	carboxylase	(	3-establishment_of_protein_localization	,	EC	6.4.1.4	)	is	an	autosomal_recessive_organic	aciduria	that	is	included	in	the	newborn	screening	programs	of	several	countries	.	.
s1046	In	conclusion	,	overexpression	of	the	striated_muscle_contraction	-	p	.	N49S	mutation	in	a	mouse	heart	can	be	responsible	for	the	phenotype	of	deep	trabeculation	,	dilated	cardiomyopathy	,	and	cardiac	dysfunction	,	which	resembles	the	phenotype	of	LVNC	.
s3854	Intriguingly	,	five	CPGs	showed	concordance	between	CNL	and	down	-	regulation	in	50	or	more	tumor_samples	,	nicotinamide_riboside_catabolic_process_(216	samples	)	,	PTEN	(	143	)	,	MCPH1	(	86	)	,	SMAD4	(	63	)	,	and	MINPP1	(	51	)	,	which	may	represent	the	recurrent	driving	force	for	gene	expression	change	during	oncogenesis	.	.
s975	We	found	protein_polyubiquitination-4326	targets	tumor_suppressor	adenomatous	polyposis	coli	2	(	APC2	)	,	which	is	a	negative	regulator	of	Wnt	pathway	,	by	binding	to	the	3	UTR	of	APC2	.	.
s1486	The	BARD1	mutations	also	caused	loss	of	transcriptional	repression	of	BRCA1-regulated	estrogen	metabolism	genes	CYP1A1	and	lipid_hydroxylation	,	breast	epithelial	cells	edited	to	create	heterozygous	loss	of	BARD1	showed	significantly	higher	expression	of	CYP1A1	and	CYP3A4	Reintroduction	of	wild	-	type	BARD1	into	these	cells	restored	CYP1A1	and	CYP3A4	transcription	to	normal	levels	,	but	introduction	of	the	cancer	-	predisposing	BARD1	RING	mutants	failed	to	do	so	.	.
s435	Idiopathic	pulmonary	fibrosis	(	IPF	)	is	a	complex	,	heterogeneous_genetic	disorder	that	is	associated	with	rare	and	common	sequence	variants	in	many	genes	(	MUC5B	,	SFTPC	,	developmental_process	,	RTEL1	,	TERT	,	and	hTR	)	,	11	novel	loci	,	and	multiple	emerging	epigenetic	and	transcriptional	profiles	.	.
s736	Mutations	in	L	-	glutamate_transmembrane_transport_are	known	to	cause	neonatal	epileptic	encephalopathy	and	migrating	partial	seizures_in	infancy	.	.
s341	In	the	remaining	cases	,	next	generation	sequencing	was	carried	out	revealing	variants	in	a	number	of	other	known	complex	spastic_paraplegia_genes	,	including	five	in	SPG7	(	5/97	)	,	four	in	FA2H	(	also	known	as	SPG35	)	(	4/97	)	and	two	in	ZFYVE26/SPG15	Variants	were	identified	in	genes	usually	associated	with	pure	spastic	paraplegia	and	also	in	the	Parkinson	s	disease	-	associated	gene	cellular_calcium_ion_homeostasis	,	neuronal	ceroid	lipofuscinosis	gene	TPP1	and	the	hereditary	motor	and	sensory	neuropathy	DNMT1	gene	,	highlighting	the	genetic	heterogeneity	of	spastic	paraplegia	.	.
s2329	PEPCK	-	M	(	pyruvate_metabolic_process	)	,	the	mitochondrial	isoform	of	phosphoenolpyruvate	carboxykinase	(	PEPCK	)	,	has	been	shown	by	us	and	others	to	be	functionally	expressed	and	to	mediate	gluconeogenesis	,	the	reverse	pathway	of	glycolysis	,	in	different	cancer_cells	.	.
s1541	Importantly	,	loss	of	smoothened_signaling_pathway_in	a	Ptch1-deleted	mouse	model	of	MB	inhibited	tumor_formation	.	.
s3676	Transcriptomic	analysis	revealed	significant	alterations	in	a	number	of	genes	associated	with	autism	,	such	as	adsl	,	nervous_system_development	,	shank3	,	and	tsc1b	.	.
s2050	Pathogenic	or	likely	pathogenic	cancer_susceptibility	gene	alterations	were	found	in	7	of	the	87	(	8	%	)	CS	/	CS	-	like	and	BRRS	patients	and	included	MUTYH	,	RET	,	TSC2	,	BRCA1	,	BRCA2	,	ERCC2	and	regulation_of_neurotransmitter_receptor_localization_to_postsynaptic_specialization_membrane	.	.
s2148	We	found	that	positive_regulation_of_apoptotic_process_KO	mice	exhibited	abnormal	global	development	,	including	prenatal	lethality	,	microphthalmia	,	polysyndactyly	,	and	abnormal_head	,	sternum	,	and	neural	tube	,	whereas	Tctn3	heterozygous	KO	mice	did	not	show	abnormal	development	or	behaviors	.	.
s3780	We	hypothesized	that	newly	identified	genetic	risk	factors	for	the	general	African	American	population	could	also	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_laboratory	biomarkers	known	to	contribute	to	the	clinical	disease	expression	of	SCA	,	including	variants	influencing	the	white	blood	cell	count	and	the	development	of	albuminuria_and	abnormal	glomerular	filtration	rate	.	.
s1745	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	memory	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s4021	A	major	implication	of	our	study	is	that	inhibition	of	miR-587	or	restoration	of	apoptotic_process_involved_in_morphogenesis_expression	may	have	significant	therapeutic	potential	to	overcome	drug	resistance	in	colorectal	cancer_patients	and	that	the	combined	use	of	an	AKT	inhibitor	with	5-FU	may	increase	efficacy	in	colorectal	cancer	treatment	.
s3610	Antiepileptic	drugs	remain	the	treatment	of	choice	for	PKD	and	episodic	ataxia_type	1	,	benzodiazepines	are	often	useful	for	negative_regulation_of_neurotransmitter_secretion	,	and	episodic	ataxia	type	2	benefits	from	acetazolamide	regardless	of	the	genetic	etiology	.
s3832	We	describe	a	multigenerational	Saudi	family	with	an	autosomal	dominant	form	of	hypohidrotic	ectodermal_dysplasia_in	which	positional	mapping	and	exome	sequencing	identified	a	novel	variant	in	regulation_of_epidermal_cell_division_that	fully	segregates	with	the	phenotype	.	.
s1882	positive_regulation_of_gene_expression_activation	,	often	due	to	genetic	amplification	,	represents	the	driving	oncogenic	event	for	a	number	of	human	tumors	,	conferring	bad	prognosis	and	predicting	very	poor	responses	even	to	the	most	aggressive	therapeutic	protocols	.	.
s413	After	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_activation	,	both	DRAM2	and	protein	1	light	chain	3	(	LC3	)	,	a	key	actor	in	the	autophagosome	formation	,	strictly	interacted	each	other	and	localized	at	mitochondrial	level	.	Altogether	these	results	suggest	that	targeting	ERb	with	selective	agonists	might	affect	HL	cell	proliferation	and	tumor_growth	via	a	mechanism	that	brings	into	play	DRAM2-dependent	autophagic	cascade	.
s1138	Using	this	gene	panel	,	we	were	able	to	identify	disease	-	causing	variants	in	17	out	of	87	(	19.5	%	)	analyzed	patients	,	all	found	in	known	epilepsy	-	associated	genes	(	KCNQ2	,	CDKL5	,	STXBP1	,	SCN1A	,	cell_adhesion	,	POLG	,	SLC2A1	,	ARX	,	ALG13	,	CHD2	,	SYNGAP1	,	and	GRIN1	)	.	.
s3013	Using	exome	sequencing	,	we	identified	dominant	mutations	in	mitochondrial_fission_on	chromosome	12p11.21	in	three	large	families	with	isolated	optic_atrophy	,	including	the	two	families	that	defined	the	OPA5	locus	on	chromosome	19q12.1	-	13.1	,	the	existence	of	which	is	denied	by	the	present	study	.	.
s455	The	individuals	with	prolyl	-	tRNA_aminoacylation_and	NARS2	mutations	,	we	have	reported	here	demonstrate	similar	neurological	features	as	those	previously	reported	,	with	diversity	in	clinical	presentation	such	as	hearing	loss	and	seizure_type	.	.
s2893	Top	10	genes	in	the	brown	module	,	including	EGF	containing	fibulin	like	extracellular	matrix	protein	2	(	elastic_fiber_assembly	)	,	fibrillin	1	(	FBN1	)	and	secreted	protein	acidic	and	cysteine	rich	(	SPARC	)	were	also	associated	with	survival	time	of	colon	cancer_patients	.	.
s266	To	conclude	,	our	results	indicated	that	siRNA	-	biological_process_inhibited	the	invasion	and	migration	of	lung	cancer_cells	,	which	can	be	considered	as	a	novel	target	for	NSCLC	treatment	.	.
s1775	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s578	Gastric	tumor	tissues	and	paired	adjacent	non	-	tumor	tissues	were	obtained	from	21	gastric	cancer_patients	,	and	gastric	cancer	cell	lines	(	AGS	,	MGC-803	,	KATO	-	III	,	MKN-45	,	muscle_organ_development-7901	,	BGC-823	and	MKN-74	)	were	cultured	.	.
s1	Our	study	further	emphasizes	that	mitochondrial_electron_transport,_NADH_to_ubiquinone_sequence	should	be	analyzed	in	patients	presenting	with	lethal	neonatal	lactic_acidemia_due	to	isolated	complex	I	deficiency	.
s2360	Western	blot	was	used	to	analyze	the	cell	cycle	-	related	proteins	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	ataxia_telangiectasia	mutant	(	protein_phosphorylation	)	,	ataxia	telangiectasia	and	Rad3-related	protein	(	ATR	)	and	cyclin	B1	(	CCNB1	)	.	.
s967	We	report	a	sibling	pair	with	FTHS	caused	by	a	homozygous	,	novel	mutation	pLys133Glnfs	13	in	the	superoxide_metabolic_process_gene	,	one	sibling	had	bilateral_ocular	hypertension	and	unilateral	colobomas	of	iris	,	choroid	and	retina	,	the	other	,	unilateral	myelinated	nerve	fiber	layer	of	the	optic	disk	and	papilledema	due	to	idiopathic	intracranial	hypertension	.	.
s1619	G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway_alterations	,	some	inherited	from	unaffected	mothers	,	have	been	reported	in	males	with	autism	,	seizures	and	severe	neurodevelopmental	abnormalities	.	.
s1001	In	this	study	,	we	show	that	microRNA	(	protein_polyubiquitination)-587	confers	resistance	to	5-fluorouracil	(	5-FU)-induced	apoptosis	in	vitro	and	reduces	the	potency	of	5-FU	in	the	inhibition	of	tumor_growth	in	a	mouse	xenograft	model	in	vivo	.	.
s3707	To	test	if	PPM1B	can	be	a	drug	target	in	the	cellular	proliferation	and	death	pathway	,	the	lentiviral	PPM1B	shRNA	was	stably	expressed	in	cancer_cell	lines	and	its	regulatory	function	in	the	regulation_of_lipid_kinase_activity	-	E2F1	pathway	was	examined	.	.
s1051	We	review	the	literature	of	genetic	PD	autopsies	from	cases	with	molecularly	confirmed	PD	or	parkinsonism_and	summarize	main	findings	on	positive_regulation_of_receptor_recycling_(n	=	25	)	,	Parkin	(	n	=	20	,	17	bi	-	allelic	and	3	heterozygotes	)	,	PINK1	(	n	=	5	,	1	bi	-	allelic	and	4	heterozygotes	)	,	DJ-1	(	n	=	1	)	,	LRRK2	(	n	=	55	)	,	GBA	(	n	=	10	Gaucher	disease	patients	with	parkinsonism	)	,	DNAJC13	,	GCH1	,	ATP13A2	,	PLA2G6	(	n	=	8	patients	,	2	with	PD	)	,	MPAN	(	n	=	2	)	,	FBXO7	,	RAB39B	,	and	ATXN2	(	SCA2	)	,	as	well	as	on	22q	deletion	syndrome	(	n	=	3	)	.	.
s3232	Therefore	,	STX3	promotes	the	growth	of	breast	cancer_cells	by	regulating	the	negative_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	-	PI3K	-	Akt	-	mTOR	signaling	.
s3914	This	similarity	was	revealed	by	the	same	number	of	passages	,	the	same	germ	cell	clusters	formation	and	similar	level	of	genes	expression	of	spermatogonial	markers	including	ubiquitin	carboxyl	-	terminal	esterase	L1	(	UCHL1	)	,	zinc	finger	and	BTB	domain	containing	16	(	ZBTB16	)	and	glial	cell	line	-	derived	neurotrophic	factor	family	receptor	alpha	1	(	GFRA1	)	,	as	well	as	germ	cell	differentiation	markers	including	signal	transducer	and	activator	of	transcription	3	(	STAT3	)	,	spermatogenesis	and	oogenesis	specific	basic	helix	-	loophelix	2	(	spermatogenesis	)	,	v	-	kit	Hardy	-	Zuckerman	4	feline	sarcoma_viral	oncogene	homolog	(	KIT	)	and	synaptonemal	complex	protein	3	(	SYCP3	)	.	.
s1799	The	tumour_suppressor	DNA_strand_renaturation_negatively	controls	cell	cycle	progression	in	response	to	perturbed	ribosome	biogenesis	in	mammalian	cells	,	thus	coordinating	growth	with	proliferation	.	.
s1881	The	generated	sensory_perception_of_sound	-	null	mice	are	ideal	models	of	human	hereditary	deafness_DFNB79	.
s3574	Results	,	The	relative	expression	levels	of	skeletal_system_development	-	AS	in	tumor_tissue	and	paired	adjacent	tissue	were	0.832	+	0.387	and	2.486	+	1.087	,	respectively	,	with	significant	difference	(	PAAAA0.001	)	.	.
s190	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal_recessive_Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy	(	SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	translational_termination	/	C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s2012	Functional	enrichment	analysis	indicated	high	bone	morphogenetic	protein	(	BMP	)	signaling	in	metastases	with	high	bone	cell	activity	and	low	tumor_cell	oxidation	-	reduction_process_activity	.	.
s2368	We	conclude	that	a2d-4	plays	an	essential	role	in	maintaining	the	structural	and	functional	integrity	of	rod	and	cone	synapses	,	the	disruption	of	which	may	contribute	to	visual_impairment_in	humans	with	calcium_ion_transmembrane_transport_mutations	.	SIGNIFICANCE	STATEMENT	In	the	retina	,	visual	information	is	first	communicated	by	the	synapse	formed	between	photoreceptors	and	second	-	order	neurons	.	.
s125	In	this	study	,	we	investigated	the	expression	of	the	cancer	/	testis	antigens	binding_of_sperm_to_zona_pellucida	,	CALR3	and	SAGE1	in	lung	and	breast	cancer	,	the	two	most	frequent	human	cancers	,	with	the	purpose	of	providing	novel	therapeutic	targets	for	these	diseases	.	.
s72	Here	we	identify	mutations	in	the	genes	encoding	protein_phosphorylation_kinase	,	a	master	regulator	of	centriole	duplication	,	and	its	substrate	TUBGCP6	in	individuals	with	microcephalic	primordial	dwarfism_and	additional	congenital	anomalies	,	including	retinopathy	,	thereby	extending	the	human	phenotypic	spectrum	associated	with	centriole	dysfunction	.	.
s2531	Together	,	these	observations	suggest	that	Zyxin	promotes	colon	cancer	tumorigenesis	in	a	mitotic	-	phosphorylation	-	dependent	manner	and	through	protein_phosphorylation	-	mediated	YAP	activation	.
s3199	Approximately	one	-	third	of	pediatric	malignant	rhabdoid	tumors	are	linked	to	germline	SWI	/	SNF	alterations	(	nucleosome_disassembly	/	INI1	,	rarely	SMARCA4	)	resulting	in	occasional	familial	clustering	of	these	highly	aggressive	malignancies	(	so	-	called	rhabdoid	tumor	predisposition	syndrome	,	RTPS	,	types	1	and	2	,	respectively	)	.	.
s2864	We	present	a	case	of	type	2	autosomal_recessive_AOS	associated	with	heterozygous	mutations	in	the	dedicator	of	cytokinesis	6	(	blood_coagulation	)	gene	,	with	characteristic	findings	of	ACC	,	TTLD	,	intracerebral	periventricular	calcifications	,	and	polymicrogyria	.
s17	Mutations	of	SLC49A1	encoding	mitochondrial_transport_are	noted	in	patients	with	a	rare	neurodegenerative	disorder	,	posterior	column	ataxia_with	retinitis	pigmentosa	.	.
s1560	Pain	scores	correlated	with	total	body	tumor	volume	(	G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway_=	0.32471	,	P	=	.0499	)	,	but	not	with	number	of	tumors	(	rho	=	0.23065	,	P	=	.1696).We	found	no	significant	difference	in	quantitative	tumor	burden	between	mutational	groups	,	but	spinal	schwannomas_were	more	common	in	LZTR1-mutant	patients	.	.
s3664	In	addition	,	the	high	proteolysis_expression	was	associated	with	large	tumor_size	and	advanced	clinical	stage	.	.
s221	Using	CRC	and	EC	genome	-	wide	association	series	,	totalling	13,265	cancer_cases	and	40,245	controls	,	we	found	that	the	protective	allele	[	G	]	at	one	previously	-	identified	CRC	polymorphism	,	rs2736100	near	transcription,_RNA	-	templated	,	was	associated	with	EC	risk	(	odds	ratio	(	OR	)	=	1.08	,	P	=	0.000167	)	,	this	polymorphism	influences	the	risk	of	several	other	cancers	.	.
s12	The	autism_susceptibility	locus	on	human	chromosome	7q32	contains	the	maternally	imprinted	regulation_of_lipid_storage_and	the	non	-	imprinted	COPG2	and	TSGA14	genes	.	.
s3429	These	findings	reveal	that	centriole_replication_contributes	to	building	full	-	length	centrioles	and	illuminate	the	molecular	mechanism	through	which	the	RTTN	(	A578P	)	mutation	causes	primary	microcephaly	.	Mutations	in	many	centriolar	protein	-	encoding	genes	cause	primary	microcephaly	.	.
s3662	Altogether	,	these	data	indicate	that	the	NIBP	-	regulated	NF	-	kB	signaling	pathway	plays	a	pivotal	role	in	the	chemoresistance	of	gastric	cancer_by	promoting	photoreceptor_cell_maintenance	-	induced	EMT	.
s1407	histone_H3-K9_demethylation_knockdown	inhibits	proliferation	and	promotes	the	apoptosis	of	ALL	cells	in	vitro	as	well	as	attenuates	tumor_growth	in	vivo	.	.
s682	This	study	involved	2	primary	renal	tricarboxylic_acid_cycle_and	12	cases	of	PC	/	PGL	with	associated	renal	neoplasia_with	a	mean	follow	up	of	74	months	.	.
s2206	The	role	of	USP18	in	breast	cancer_provides	a	novel	insight	into	the	clinical	application	of	the	USP18/positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	/	Skp2	pathway	.
s2291	Single	nucleotide	polymorphisms	in	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_genes	have	been	associated	with	increased	risk	of	several	diseases	,	including	type	1	and	type	2	diabetes	,	glaucoma	,	and	neurological	disorders	.	.
s1035	That	binding	,	which	interferes	with	the	interaction	of	regulation_of_modification_of_postsynaptic_actin_cytoskeleton	-	GTP	with	the	RhoGAP	domain	,	reduces	the	hydrolysis	of	RhoA	-	GTP	,	the	binding	of	other	DLC1	ligands	,	and	the	colocalization	of	DLC1	with	focal	adhesions	and	attenuates	tumor_suppressor	activity	.	.
s3216	Dysfunction	of	the	cerebral	glucose	transporter	GLUT1	(	encoded	by	protein	-	containing_complex_assembly	)	is	known	to	result	in	epilepsy	,	intellectual	disability	(	ID	)	,	and	movement	disorder	.	.
s2432	The	two	glycoproteins	were	detected	in	the	cytosol	of	tumor_cells	with	varying	intensity	,	regulation_of_autophagy-1	showing	again	enhanced	expression	.	.
s4075	These	changes	were	accompanied	by	cortical_atrophy_as	well	as	increased	expression	of	angiogenesis	-	related	genes	such	as	Vegfa	,	Serpine1	,	and	regulation_of_signaling_receptor_activity_in	CD31-positive	endothelial	cells	.	.
s3465	Gene	set	enrichment	analysis	was	conducted	to	study	the	relevant	mechanisms	.	Bladder	cancer	patients	in	COL5A2	low	expression	group	were	associated	with	better	invasiveness	(	P	AAAA	.0001	)	,	tumor_grade	(	P	=	.001	)	,	T	staging	(	P	AAAA	.0001	)	,	N	staging	(	P	=	.002	)	,	cancer	specific	survival	(	P	AAAA	.0001	)	,	overall	survival	(	P	AAAA	.0001	)	,	and	a	trend	of	better	M	staging	(	P	=	.053	)	than	those	in	COL5A2	high	expression	group	.	COL5A2	might	affect	the	progression	of	bladder	cancer	through	AAAAAACoagulation	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAHypoxia	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAApical	junction	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAUltraviolet	response	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAEpithelial	mesenchymal	transition	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAAngiogenesis	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAApositive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_(KRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	)	signaling	,	AAAAAAComplement	,	AAAAAAIL2-STAT5-signaling	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAInflammatory	response	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAIL6-JAK	-	STAT3-signaling	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAMyogenesis	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAATNF	a	signaling	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAAApoptosis	,	AAAAAA	and	AAAAAAHedgehog	-	signaling	.	AAAAA	,	Our	results	demonstrated	that	COL5A2	was	correlated	with	poor	clinical	outcomes	and	survivals	of	patients	with	bladder	cancer	,	suggesting	that	it	could	be	regarded	as	a	biomarker	of	bladder	cancer	.
s2744	Previously	reported	patients	with	UDP	-	N	-	acetylglucosamine_transmembrane_transport	-	CDG	have	been	described	with	syndromic	autism	,	epilepsy	,	and	arthrogryposis	.
s2843	High	grade	transformation	cases	were	analysed	,	the	high	grade	SCSG	components	showed	a	significantly	increased	regulation_of_proteasomal_protein_catabolic_process-67	index	and	cyclin	D1	positive	tumor_cells	compared	to	the	conventional	SCSG	components	.	.
s1095	Seborrhoeic	Dermatitis	(	negative_regulation_of_protein_export_from_nucleus	)	is	a	common	inflammatory	skin	disease	that	presents	as	itchy	,	flaking_skin_in	the	seborrhoeic	areas	.	.
s338	In	the	remaining	cases	,	next	generation	sequencing	was	carried	out	revealing	variants	in	a	number	of	other	known	complex	spastic_paraplegia_genes	,	including	five	in	SPG7	(	5/97	)	,	four	in	FA2H	(	also	known	as	SPG35	)	(	4/97	)	and	two	in	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination	/	SPG15	Variants	were	identified	in	genes	usually	associated	with	pure	spastic	paraplegia	and	also	in	the	Parkinson	s	disease	-	associated	gene	ATP13A2	,	neuronal	ceroid	lipofuscinosis	gene	TPP1	and	the	hereditary	motor	and	sensory	neuropathy	DNMT1	gene	,	highlighting	the	genetic	heterogeneity	of	spastic	paraplegia	.	.
s236	Germline	mutations	in	KCNJ5	and	CACNA1H	cause	FH	-	III	and	FH	-	IV	,	respectively	,	while	germline	mutations	in	calcium_ion_transport_cause	the	rare	PASNA	syndrome	,	featuring	primary	aldosteronism	seizures_and	neurological	abnormalities	.	.
s3695	The	expression	of	negative_regulation_of_peptidase_activity_in	tumors	was	significantly	associated	with	pT	classification	(	deeper	tumor	invasions	)	(	P	=	.0118	)	and	advanced	TNM	stages	(	P	=	.0497	)	.	.
s3938	Conclusion	,	Cases	with	nuclear	-	transcribed_mRNA_catabolic_process_gene	defects	often	manifests	as	short_stature	,	optic	nerve	atrophy	,	Pelger	-	Huet	anomaly	,	skeletal	dysplasia	,	recurrent	infections	,	abnormality	of	liver	enzymes	,	progeroid	appearance	,	proptosis	,	hypotonia	and	immunodeficiency	.	.
s3007	Samples	analyzed	were	10	pairs	of	exocytosis	-	frozen	surgical	specimens	of	cancerous	and	non	-	cancerous	thymic	tissue	.	.
s3141	At	the	suggestive	threshold	(	P	AAAA	.001	)	,	6	genes	were	enriched	for	rare	damaging	variants	(	peptidyl	-	serine_phosphorylation	,	AP1G2	,	DNTA	,	CHST6	,	FGFR3	,	and	EPHA1	)	and	7	genes	had	associations	with	pancreatic	cancer_risk	,	based	on	the	sequence	-	kernel	association	test	.	.
s1888	Therefore	,	we	propose	that	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination_inhibition	might	be	an	effective	strategy	to	treat	MYCN	-	amplified	and	p53	wild	-	type	neuroblastoma	,	and	suggest	that	targeting	replication	stress	with	appropriate	tools	should	be	further	exploited	to	tackle	MYCN	-	driven	tumors	.
s1937	The	protein	product	of	the	breast	and	ovarian	cancer_gene	,	BRCA1	,	is	part	of	an	obligate	heterodimer	with	negative_regulation_of_protein_export_from_nucleus	.	.
s1974	Corresponding	tumor_tissue	slices	were	stained	immunohistochemically	for	cell	-	matrix_adhesion	.	.
s581	The	results	indicated	that	compared	with	the	adjacent	non	-	tumor_tissues	and	a	normal	gastric	epithelial	cell	line	,	gastric	cancer	tissues	and	cell	lines	exhibited	significantly	higher	expression	of	proteasomal_protein_catabolic_process	.	.
s1253	This	interval	encompasses	several	genes	,	especially	the	short_stature_homeobox	(	SHOX	)	and	arylsulfatase	(	skeletal_system_development	)	genes	.	.
s608	Genes	with	DMRs	were	involved	in	inflammatory	response	(	IRAK4	and	ESM1	)	,	cancer_(BRCA1	and	LASP1	)	,	endocrine	function	(	biological_process	)	,	and	male	fertility	(	IFT140	,	TESC	,	and	PRDM8	)	.	.
s2988	The	epithelial	-	mesenchymal	transition	(	EMT	)	and	mesenchymal	-	epithelial	transition	(	endothelial_cell_morphogenesis	)	contribute	to	cancer_metastasis	of	pancreatic	ductal	adenocarcinoma	(	PDAC	)	.	.
s3982	Oncogenes	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_and	ras	are	frequently	mutated	and	activated	in	human	lung	cancers	.	.
s53	The	created	databases	include	ACAD8	(	isobutyryl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	deficiency	(	IBD	)	)	,	ACADSB	(	short	-	chain	acyl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	(	SCAD	)	deficiency	)	,	AUH	(	3-methylglutaconic	aciduria	(	3-MGCA	)	)	,	DHCR7	(	Smith	-	Lemli	-	Opitz	syndrome	)	,	HMGCS2	(	3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl	-	CoA	synthase	2	deficiency	)	,	protein_homotetramerization_(17-beta	-	hydroxysteroid	dehydrogenase	X	deficiency	)	,	FKBP14	(	Ehlers	-	Danlos	syndrome	with	progressive	kyphoscoliosis	,	myopathy	,	and	hearing	loss	,	EDSKMH	)	and	ROGDI	(	Kohlschutter	-	Tonz	syndrome	)	.	.
s729	Recently	mutations	in	the	CASPR	/	CNTN1	complex	have	been	associated	with	similar	severe	phenotypes	and	central_nervous_system_myelination_gene	mutations	,	causing	loss	of	the	CASPR	protein	,	were	shown	to	cause	severe	,	prenatal	onset	arthrogryposis_multiplex	congenita	in	four	unrelated	families	.	.
s2056	In	this	study	we	show	that	downregulation	of	Lin28b	by	protein_polyubiquitination-125a	partially	accounts	for	its	antiproliferative	activity	toward	hepatocellular_carcinoma_cells	.	.
s375	Here	,	we	used	immunohistochemical	staining	to	measure	negative_regulation_of_phosphatase_activity_expression	in	147	samples	from	tumors	and	30	samples	from	the	adjacent	normal	lung	tissues	of	patients	with	non	-	small	cell	lung	cancer	.	.
s1787	Because	of	technical	limitations	,	this	model	of	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	-	dependent	DNA	methylation	inheritance	has	been	constructed	largely	based	on	genetics	and	biochemical	observations	querying	methylated	DNA	oligonucleotides	,	synthetic	histone	peptides	,	and	heterogeneous_chromatin	extracted	from	cells	.	.
s1675	Mutations	in	KIF1C	are	responsible	for	autosomal	recessive	spastic	paraplegia_type	58	(	SPG58	)	and	spastic	ataxia	2	(	anterograde_neuronal_dense_core_vesicle_transport	)	.	.
s1181	Conversely	,	cell	-	matrix_adhesion_expression	appeared	to	be	upregulated	in	lung	cancer_tissue	.	.
s3479	Functionally	,	definitive_hemopoiesis_overexpression	accelerated	breast	cancer_cell	proliferation	and	migration	,	while	an	opposite	effect	was	observed	when	MFAP5	was	knocked	down	.	.
s2471	Permanent	visual_impairment_(bilateral	best	-	corrected	visual	acuity	AAAA	0.3	)	was	found	in	7	patients	,	including	patients	with	a	mutation	in	RAF1	,	SHOC2	,	and	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	.	.
s2825	We	detected	11	novel	mutations	in	cell	-	cell_signaling	,	GJA8	,	CRYAA	,	CRYBB2	,	CRYGS	,	CRYGA	,	GCNT2	,	CRYGA	,	and	MIP	,	and	three	previously	reported	cataract	-	causing	mutations	in	GJA8	,	CRYAA	,	and	CRYBB2	The	most	commonly	mutated	genes	were	those	coding	for	gap	junctions	and	crystallin	proteins	.	.
s623	In	addition	,	we	found	that	FOXC1	regulation	of	RAB3GAP1	,	establishment_of_protein_localization_to_endoplasmic_reticulum_membrane_and	SNAP25	affects	secretion	of	Myocilin	(	MYOC	)	,	a	protein	associated	with	juvenile	onset	glaucoma_and	steroid	-	induced	glaucoma	.	.
s3114	Breakthrough	discoveries	include	the	role	of	somatic	variants	in	the	KCNJ5	,	calcium_ion_transport	,	ATP1A1	,	and	ATP2B3	genes	as	causes	of	aldosterone	-	producing	adenomas	(	APAs	)	,	and	the	recognition	of	three	novel	hyperaldosteronism_syndromes	with	germline	variants	in	the	KCNJ5	,	CACNA1D	,	and	CACNA1H	genes	.	.
s2844	Here	we	show	that	metabolic	reprogramming	of	colorectal	cancer_is	caused	chiefly	by	aberrant	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_expression	.	.
s325	The	most	frequent	hearing_loss_associated	allele	detected	in	this	population	was	the	235delC	variant	in	gap_junction_assembly_gene	.	.
s3482	Here	,	we	use	a	combination	of	genetic	mouse	models	to	demonstrate	that	camera	-	type_eye_development_mutations	leading	to	reduced	ocular	size	and	hyperopia_act	via	a	loss	of	function	mechanism	.	.
s2991	Furthermore	,	silencing	of	positive_regulation_of_cytokine	-	mediated_signaling_pathway_dramatically	down	-	regulated	the	expression	of	b	-	catenin	,	cyclin	-	D1	and	c	-	Myc	in	PEC	cells	,	and	the	activator	of	the	Wnt	/	b	-	catenin	pathway	LiCl	rescued	the	anticancer_effect	of	knockdown	TRIM44	expression	in	PTC	cells	.	.
s823	In	this	study	,	breast	cancer_tissue	samples	were	obtained	from	Zhejiang	University	(	ZJU	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	)	.	.
s220	In	four	families	with	early	-	onset	recessive	optic	neuropathy	,	we	identified	mutations	in	regulation_of_dendrite_development	,	which	encodes	a	mitochondrial	ubiquinol	oxydo	-	reductase	.	.
s1568	Two	cases	showed	acellular	collagenous	stroma	constituted	AAAA50	%	of	the	tumor_confirming	to	the	diagnosis	of	sclerosing	brain_development	.	.
s754	Single	nucleotide	polymorphism	in	infant	genes	in	the	folate	(	MTHFS	rs12438477	)	,	homocysteine	(	tRNA_methylation_rs6602178	and	GNMT	rs11752813	)	and	transsulfuration	(	GSTP1	rs7941395	and	MGST1	rs7294985	)	pathways	were	also	associated	with	an	increased	risk	of	congenital_heart_defects	.	Conclusions	Common	maternal	or	infant	genetic	variants	in	folate	,	homocysteine	,	or	transsulfuration	pathways	are	associated	with	an	increased	risk	of	certain	congenital	heart	defects	among	children	of	women	taking	SSRIs	during	cardiogenesis	.
s2061	Among	all	lung	adenocarcinomas	,	the	most	prevalent	subset	develops	via	tumorigenesis	and	progression	from	atypical	adenomatous	hyperplasia	(	AAH	)	to	adenocarcinoma	in	situ	(	AIS	)	,	to	minimally	invasive	adenocarcinoma	(	cell_proliferation	)	,	to	overt	invasive	adenocarcinoma	with	a	lepidic	pattern	.	.
s889	16q24	deletion	involving	the	odontogenesis_of_dentin	-	containing_tooth_gene	,	ranging	from	137	kb	to	2	Mb	,	have	been	associated	with	a	microdeletion	syndrome	characterized	by	variable	cognitive	impairment	,	autism	spectrum	disorder	,	facial	dysmorphisms	with	dental_anomalies	,	brain	abnormalities	essentially	affecting	the	corpus	callosum	and	short	stature	.	.
s1873	Homozygous	null	mutation	of	tumor_suppressor	negative_regulation_of_Wnt_signaling_pathway	/	Wwox	gene	leads	to	severe	neural	diseases	,	metabolic	disorders	and	early	death	in	the	newborns	of	humans	,	mice	and	rats	.	.
s2396	Immunohistochemical	method	was	used	to	examine	the	immunoexpression	of	membrane_protein_ectodomain_proteolysis_and	microvessel	density	in	80	cases	of	oral	squamous	cell	carcinoma	(	OSCC	)	,	without	metastases	;	OSCC	M(-	)	(	n	=	38	)	,	and	with	metastases	;	OSCC	M(+	)	(	n	=	42	)	,	in	24	cases	of	oral_leukoplakia_(OLK	)	,	(	15	cases	with	low	-	grade	dysplasia	;	OLK	-	LG	,	and	9	cases	with	high	-	grade	dysplasia	;	OLK	-	HG	)	,	and	19	controls	.	.
s2634	This	disorder	shows	autosomal_recessive_inheritance_and	is	caused	mostly	by	mutations	in	the	retinoid_metabolic_process_gene	.	.
s3535	We	found	that	Smac	,	combined	with	nervous_system_development_greatly	inhibited	proliferation	of	subcutaneous	xenografts	of	ovarian	cancer_cell	line	SKOV3/DDP	without	side	effects	.	.
s663	The	clinical	presentation	of	our	patients	differs	from	the	original	prolyl	-	tRNA_aminoacylation	-	associated	syndrome	in	the	severe	postnatal	growth	failure	,	absence	of	epilepsy	,	and	minor	MRI	findings	,	thus	further	expanding	the	phenotypic	spectrum	of	the	glutaminyl	-	tRNA	synthetase	deficiency	syndromes	.
s3406	Although	many	new	anti	-	cancer_drugs	were	developed	in	the	last	years	,	it	is	unclear	which	of	these	drugs	can	be	safely	combined	to	improve	standard	therapy	without	antagonizing	anti	-	humoral_immune_response_efficacy	.	.
s2632	Furthermore	,	with	an	increasing	number	of	pathogenic	mutations	leading	to	epilepsy_and	hearing	loss	being	discovered	in	the	TLDc	protein	neuron_projection_development	,	understanding	the	function	of	this	family	has	important	implications	for	a	range	of	inherited	neurological	diseases	.
s1195	In	particular	,	MYH9	mutations	result	in	congenital	macrothrombocytopenia_and	predispose	to	kidney	failure	,	hearing	loss	,	and	cataracts	,	MPL	and	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_mutations	cause	congenital	thrombocytopenia	evolving	into	bone	marrow	failure	,	whereas	thrombocytopenias	caused	by	RUNX1	,	ANKRD26	,	and	ETV6	mutations	are	characterized	by	predisposition	to	hematological	malignancies	.	.
s3638	Microrchidia	2	(	fatty_acid_metabolic_process	)	is	important	in	DNA	damage	repair	and	lipogenesis	,	however	,	the	clinical	and	functional	role	of	MORC2	in	liver	cancer_remains	to	be	fully	elucidated	.	.
s3182	Our	results	demonstrate	extensively	overlapping	functions	between	the	Hsregulation_of_tumor_necrosis_factor	-	mediated_signaling_pathway_and	CeCYLD	,	which	establish	the	C.	elegans	protein	as	a	valuable	model	for	the	elucidation	of	the	complex	activity	of	the	human	tumor_suppressor	protein	.
s2423	In	this	report	we	describe	a	female	child	with	global	developmental_delay	,	microcephaly	and	myoclonic	seizures	harbouring	a	5	Mb	deletion	in	14q12	locus	resulting	in	deletion	of	single	copy	of	brain	specific	genes	FOXG1	,	PRKD1	and	negative_regulation_of_cold	-	induced_thermogenesis	.	.
s1282	Stable	re	-	expression	of	transcription,_DNA	-	templated	,	resulted	in	26	downregulated	proteins	while	59	proteins	were	overexpressed	in	renal	cancer_cells	.	.
s1723	This	study	identifies	the	influence	of	protein_polyubiquitination-142	-	3p	on	mammary	stemness	properties	and	breast	cancer_radioresistance	to	establish	its	role	in	this	setting	.	.
s2778	Here	the	authors	show	that	human	microcephaly_protein	centriole_replication_directly	interacts	with	STIL	and	acts	downstream	of	STIL	-	mediated	centriole	assembly	,	contributing	to	building	full	-	length	centrioles	.
s3967	We	suggest	that	leukemias	and	lymphomas	with	FLT3	fusion	genes	exhibit	similar	clinicopathologic	features	to	,	and	should	be	included	in	,	the	WHO	category	of	AAAAAAMyeloid	and	lymphoid	neoplasms	with	eosinophilia_and	abnormalities	of	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation	,	PDGFRB	,	or	FGFR1	,	or	with	PCM1-JAK2.AAAAA	.
s1290	oecilium_assembly_strongly	inhibited	IL-6	expression	,	which	is	closely	related	to	tumoral	growth	,	compared	with	control	cells	,	suggesting	that	WDR34	would	be	a	critical	molecule	for	control	of	tumoral	progression	.	.
s733	Here	we	report	a	consanguineous	Arab	family	from	Qatar	with	three	children	having	an	early	lethal	form	of	arthrogryposis_multiplex	congenita	and	a	novel	frameshift	mutation	in	central_nervous_system_myelination	.	.
s2663	However	,	the	clinical	significance	and	precise	role	of	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_in	cancer_progression	are	largely	unknown	.	.
s2753	Loss	-	of	-	function	mutations	of	negative_regulation_of_keratinocyte_proliferation_are	associated	with	intellectual	disability	and	microcephaly_with	pontine	and	cerebellar	hypoplasia	(	MICPCH	)	,	especially	in	females	.	.
s785	Biallelic	mutations	in	the	brain_development_gene	,	encoding	ATPase	family	protein	,	are	an	important	cause	of	newly	recognized	epileptic	encephalopathy	classified	as	epilepsy	,	hearing_loss	,	and	mental	retardation	syndrome	(	EHLMRS	,	OMIM	,	616577	)	.	.
s1842	This	review	discusses	recurrent	aberrations	in	NKTCL	detected	by	NGS	,	which	can	be	categorized	into	three	main	groups	,	specifically	,	tumor_suppressors	(	TP53	,	DDX3X	,	and	MGA	)	,	the	JAK	/	STAT	cascade	,	and	epigenetic	modifiers	(	KMT2D	,	BCOR	,	nucleosome_disassembly	,	and	EP300	)	.	.
s2613	Initial	antitumoral	responses	are	often	seen	,	but	drug	-	resistant	clones	with	reactivation	of	the	MEK	-	angiogenesis_pathway	soon	appear	.	.
s810	Mutations	,	A147	T	and	A165V	,	within	the	ZM	of	sarcomere_organization	-	LDex10	cause	myofibrillar	myopathy	,	but	the	mechanism	is	unknown	.	.
s1570	Molecular	analyses	showed	mutations	of	exon	3	of	CTNNB1	in	more	than	half	of	these	tumors	,	and	nuclear	accumulation	of	b	-	catenin	and	over	expression	of	cyclin	D1	can	be	useful	for	the	differential	diagnosis	of	brain_development	,	NOS	.
s655	In	aggregate	,	our	findings	implicate	positive_regulation_of_cell_migration_as	a	gene	involved	in	the	recessive	form	of	MMIHS	,	confirming	that	this	disease	of	the	visceral	organs	is	heterogeneous_with	a	myopathic	origin	.
s1615	With	the	notable	exception	of	WNT10A	(	Tooth	agenesis	,	selective	,	4	,	MIM	#	150400	)	,	the	genotype	-	phenotype	relationships	described	in	the	present	cohort	represent	an	expansion	of	the	clinical	spectrum	associated	with	these	genes	,	sensory_perception_of_sound_(Deafness	,	autosomal_recessive_98	,	MIM	#	614861	)	,	LAMB3	(	Amelogenesis	imperfecta	,	type	IA	,	MIM	#	104530	,	Epidermolysis	bullosa	,	junctional	,	MIMs	#	226700	and	#	226650	)	,	and	BCOR	(	Microphthalmia	,	syndromic	2	,	MIM	#	300166	)	.	.
s1611	Hepatocellular	carcinoma	(	phosphatidylinositol_phosphorylation	)	is	the	third	leading	cause	of	cancer	-	related	death	worldwide	,	however	,	the	mutational	properties	of	HCC	-	associated	carcinogens	remain	largely	uncharacterized	.	.
s1211	We	recommend	stress	-	activated_protein_kinase_signaling_cascade_analysis	in	cases	of	severe	non	-	syndromic	congenital	hydrocephalus	,	especially	when	aqueduct	stenosis	with	or	without	a	medial	diverticulum	is	seen	,	in	order	to	aid	prognosis	discussion	.
s3557	Thirty	-	eight	genes	were	sequenced	in	a	larger	independent	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_of	148	carcinoma	/	normal	tissue	pairs	to	obtain	more	precise	mutation	frequencies	.	.
s3306	The	activation	of	signal	transducer	and	activator	of	transcription	3	(	regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	)	by	elevated	interleukin	(	IL	)	levels	has	been	reported	to	regulate	tumorigenesis	both	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	.	.
s3794	Oropharyngeal	cancer_associations	were	limited	to	the	human	leukocyte	antigen	(	HLA	)	region	,	and	classical	HLA	allele	imputation	showed	a	protective	association	with	the	class	II	haplotype	HLA	-	DRB1	1301-HLA	-	DQA1	0103-immunoglobulin_production_involved_in_immunoglobulin_mediated_immune_response	0603	(	odds	ratio	(	OR	)	=	0.59	,	P	=	2.7	x	10	-	9	)	.	.
s1516	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	positive_regulation_of_cytokinesis	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s2458	In	T2D	patients	,	animal_organ_morphogenesis_Arg192His	was	associated	with	earlier	age	at	diagnosis	,	and	GLP1R	Arg131Gln	was	associated	with	decreased	risk	of	cardiovascular_disease	.	.
s1749	We	phenotyped	a	large	population	of	typical	individuals	for	schizophrenia	-	spectrum	and	autism	-	spectrum	traits	,	and	genotyped	them	for	the	single	-	nucleotide	polymorphism	rs850807	,	which	is	putatively	functional	and	linked	with	MAGEL2	and	nervous_system_development_Genetic	variation	in	rs850807	was	strongly	and	exclusively	associated	with	the	ideas	of	reference	subscale	of	the	schizophrenia	spectrum	,	which	is	best	typified	as	paranoia	.	.
s1456	We	investigated	the	possible	association	between	chemoresistance	and	cellular	redox	state	regulation	in	patients	undergoing	neoadjuvant	chemotherapy	(	citrate_transport	)	for	breast	cancer	.	.

s3355	We	found	that	positive_regulation_of_canonical_Wnt_signaling_pathway_expression	in	the	epithelium	and	stroma	was	associated	with	tumor_stage	,	and	by	integrating	functional	experiments	with	LGR5-sorted	cell	RNA	sequencing	data	from	adenoma	and	normal	organoids	,	we	found	correlations	between	LGR5	and	CRC	-	specific	genes	,	including	dickkopf	WNT	signaling	pathway	inhibitor	4	(	DKK4	)	and	SPARC	-	related	modular	calcium	binding	2	(	SMOC2	)	.	.
s2694	Nine	variants	in	creatine_biosynthetic_process_were	shown	to	have	a	lower	minor	allele	frequency	(	MAF	)	in	the	autism_population	than	in	the	1000	Genomes	database	,	specifically	in	the	East	Asian	population	(	Fisher	s	exact	test	)	.	.
s949	Mutations	in	the	RNA	exosome	gene	positive_regulation_of_cell_growth_cause	a	distinct	syndrome	with	various	tissue	-	specific	phenotypes	including	retinitis	pigmentosa	and	mild	intellectual_disability	.	.

s3046	The	most	likely	causal	variant	identified	was	a	novel	missense	variant	in	the	X	-	linked	glutamate_receptor_signaling_pathway_gene	,	which	has	been	implicated	in	intellectual_disability	.	.
s3404	In	this	study	,	a	novel	insert	mutation	in	visual_perception_was	identified	in	a	Chinese	congenital	cataract_family	and	cosegregated	with	the	disease	in	this	pedigree	.	.

s3090	By	screening	a	large	cohort	of	132	patients	with	early	-	onset	severe	sensory	,	motor	and	cranial	nerve	neuropathy_we	confirmed	the	strong	genetic	link	between	riboflavin	transporter	mutations	and	Brown	-	Vialetto	-	Van	Laere	syndrome	,	identifying	22	pathogenic	mutations	in	SLC52A2	and	riboflavin_transport	,	14	of	which	were	novel	.	.
s71	Intragenic	mutations	of	the	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_gene	,	as	well	as	larger	deletions	of	Xq24	encompassing	UBE2A	have	in	recent	years	been	associated	with	a	syndromic	form	of	X	-	linked	intellectual_disability_called	UBE2A	deficiency	syndrome	or	X	-	linked	intellectual	disability	type	Nascimento	(	OMIM#300860	)	.	.
s2018	In	vitro	cell	proliferation	,	apoptosis	and	migration	assays	,	and	in	vivo	subcutaneous	xenograft	tumor_models	were	used	to	determine	the	role	of	substrate_adhesion	-	dependent_cell_spreading	.	.
s695	Altogether	these	data	demonstrate	that	mutations	in	negative_regulation_of_protein_kinase_activity_cause	a	congenital	muscular	dystrophy	syndrome	with	short	stature	,	cataracts	,	and	intellectual	disability	.
s386	SNP	microarray	and	whole	exome	sequencing	identified	a	homozygous	frameshift	mutation	(	p	.	L870V	)	in	heterophilic_cell	-	cell_adhesion_via_plasma_membrane_cell_adhesion_molecules_and	predicted	damaging	mutations	in	several	genes	,	most	notably	DGCR2	(	p	.	P75L	)	and	NCAM2	(	p	.	S147	G	)	,	both	possible	candidates	for	this	child	s	intellectual_disability	.	.
s3970	The	older	brother	presented	with	progressive	gait	difficulties	,	hypotonia	,	intermittent	dystonia	,	polycythemia	,	and	characteristic	T_cell_costimulation	-	hyperintense	lesions	on	MRI	brain	.	.
s2514	Extensive	search	of	the	literature	revealed	a	potential	key	role	of	genes	at	the	identified	porcine	loci	in	tumor_invasion	(	DST	,	biological_process	,	CBY1	,	LIMK2	and	ETV5	)	and	immune	response	modulation	(	ETV5	,	HERC3	and	DICER1	)	of	the	progression	phenotypes	.	.
s3768	The	proteomic	data	suggested	that	Danu	-	regulated	cytoplasmic_translation_signaling	might	contribute	to	the	cancer_cell	killing	effect	.	.
s1292	Our	findings	suggested	that	cilium_assembly_inhibits	OSCC	progression	and	might	be	a	potential	tumor	-	suppressor	molecule	in	OSCCs	.
s477	Mutations	in	the	Pejvakin	(	sensory_perception_of_sound	)	gene	cause	autosomal	recessive	hearing	loss	DFNB59	with	audiological	features	of	auditory	neuropathy_spectrum	disorder	(	ANSD	)	or	cochlear	dysfunction	.	.
s1533	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	cell	-	matrix_adhesion_and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s3710	Our	results	suggest	that	PPM1B	plays	a	negative	role	in	the	activation	of	the	p38-regulation_of_lipid_kinase_activity	-	E2F1	pathway	and	that	targeting	PPM1B	could	be	useful	in	certain	types	of	cancer_by	stimulating	chemotherapy	-	induced	cell	death	.
s4034	cytoskeletal_anchoring_at_plasma_membrane	-	related	disorders	are	classified	as	spondylocarpotarsal	synostosis	(	SCT	)	,	Larsen	syndrome	(	LS	)	,	atelosteogenesis	(	AO	)	,	boomerang	dysplasia	(	BD	)	,	and	isolated	congenital	talipes	equinovarus	,	presenting	with	scoliosis	,	short	-	limbed	dwarfism	,	clubfoot	,	joint	dislocation	and	other	unique	skeletal_abnormalities	.	.
s3911	This	similarity	was	revealed	by	the	same	number	of	passages	,	the	same	germ	cell	clusters	formation	and	similar	level	of	genes	expression	of	spermatogonial	markers	including	ubiquitin	carboxyl	-	terminal	esterase	L1	(	protein_deubiquitination	)	,	zinc	finger	and	BTB	domain	containing	16	(	ZBTB16	)	and	glial	cell	line	-	derived	neurotrophic	factor	family	receptor	alpha	1	(	GFRA1	)	,	as	well	as	germ	cell	differentiation	markers	including	signal	transducer	and	activator	of	transcription	3	(	STAT3	)	,	spermatogenesis	and	oogenesis	specific	basic	helix	-	loophelix	2	(	SOHLH2	)	,	v	-	kit	Hardy	-	Zuckerman	4	feline	sarcoma_viral	oncogene	homolog	(	KIT	)	and	synaptonemal	complex	protein	3	(	SYCP3	)	.	.
s3428	Interestingly	,	the	naturally	occurring	microcephaly	-	associated	mutant	,	RTTN	(	A578P	)	,	shows	a	low	affinity	for	centrosome_duplication_binding	and	blocks	centriole	assembly	.	.
s821	We	constructed	an	skeletal_muscle_tissue_regeneration	-	knockout	zebrafish	-	line	by	TALEN	technology	which	showed	visual_impairment_at	an	early	age	,	while	the	histological	and	immunofluorescence	assays	indicated	the	presence	of	progressive	retinal	degeneration	with	a	cone	predominately	affected	pattern	.	.
s2163	Although	some	potential	glioblastoma	biomarkers	have	already	been	identified	,	there	is	a	lack	of	cell	membrane	-	bound	biomarkers	capable	of	distinguishing	brain	tissue	from	glioblastoma	and/or	glioblastoma	stem	cells	(	neural_crest_cell_fate_specification	)	,	which	are	responsible	for	the	rapid	post	-	operative	tumor_reoccurrence	.	.
s1045	striated_muscle_contraction_encoding	dystrobrevin	-	a	(	a	-	DB	)	is	a	putative	causal	gene	associated	with	left_ventricular_noncompaction_cardiomyopathy	(	LVNC	)	.	.
s3251	Biallelic	mutations	of	the	gene	encoding	diphthamide	biosynthesis	1	(	peptidyl	-	diphthamide_biosynthetic_process_from_peptidyl	-	histidine	,	NM_001383.3	)	cause	developmental_delay	,	dysmorphic	features	,	sparse	hair	,	and	short	stature	(	MIM	_	603527	)	.	.
s3857	Intriguingly	,	five	CPGs	showed	concordance	between	CNL	and	down	-	regulation	in	50	or	more	tumor_samples	,	MTAP	(	216	samples	)	,	PTEN	(	143	)	,	MCPH1	(	86	)	,	transforming_growth_factor_beta_receptor_signaling_pathway_(63	)	,	and	MINPP1	(	51	)	,	which	may	represent	the	recurrent	driving	force	for	gene	expression	change	during	oncogenesis	.	.
s373	Previous	studies	have	implicated	coiled	-	coil	domain	-	containing	protein	8	(	negative_regulation_of_phosphatase_activity	)	as	a	tumor_suppressor	in	several	types	of	cancer	,	such	as	breast	and	prostate	cancers	.	.
s2172	We	show	that	loss	of	the	Drosophila	long-/very	-	long	-	chain	acyl	-	CoA	synthetase	genes	bgm	and/or	dbb	is	indistinguishable	from	loss	of	the	Drosophila	ABC	transporter	gene	ABCD	Shared	loss	-	of	-	function	phenotypes	for	synthetase	and	transporter	mutants	point	to	a	lipid	metabolic	pathway	association	with	fatty_acid_beta	-	oxidation	-	like	neurodegenerative_disease_in	Drosophila	,	a	pathway	association	that	has	yet	to	be	established	in	humans	.	.
s2317	MATERIAL	AND	METHODS	The	expression	of	dolichol	-	linked_oligosaccharide_biosynthetic_process_in	breast_carcinoma_tissues	was	determined	by	immunochemistry	.	.
s3175	In	conclusion	,	polymorphisms	of	rs2271037	and	rs3749585	in	peptide_hormone_processing_were	significantly	associated	with	hypertension_in	a	Han	population	of	northeastern	China	.	.
s1449	In	T2D	patients	,	PAX4	Arg192His	was	associated	with	earlier	age	at	diagnosis	,	and	adenylate_cyclase	-	activating_G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway_Arg131Gln	was	associated	with	decreased	risk	of	cardiovascular_disease	.	.
s3865	Allelic	heterogeneity_was	observed	at	MAPK_cascade_while	European	risk	SNPs	at	6	other	loci	including	MAPT	and	GBA	-	SYT11	were	non	-	polymorphic	or	very	rare	in	our	cohort	.	.
s548	Recent	studies	have	suggested	possible	therapeutic	targets	for	some	patients	with	early	-	onset	glaucoma_based	on	the	molecular	and	cellular	events	caused	by	MYOC	,	positive_regulation_of_autophagy_and	TBK1	mutations	.	.
s3189	The	tumor_was	diagnosed	ACC	with	immunohistochemistry	,	positive	to	ACC	phenotype(a1-antitrypsin	,	a1-antichymotrypsin	,	toll	-	like_receptor_signaling_pathway	)	.	.
s2324	The	combination	of	low	positive_regulation_of_cell_migration_expression	and	high	RNASEH2A	expression	resulted	in	impaired	proliferation	in	four	kidney	cancer_cell	lines	,	suggesting	potential	synthetic	dosage	lethality	(	SDL	)	interactions	between	the	two	genes	.	.
s867	Metabolic	cutis	laxa	results	from	Menkes	syndrome	,	caused	by	a	defect	in	the	ATPase	copper	transporting	alpha	(	ATP7A	)	gene	,	congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	due	to	mutations	in	subunit	7	of	the	component	of	oligomeric	Golgi	(	COG7)-congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	(	CDG	)	complex	,	combined	disorder	of	N-	and	O	-	linked	glycosylation	,	due	to	mutations	in	ATPase	H+	transporting	V0	subunit	a2	(	ATP6VOA2	)	gene	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	reductase	1	deficiency	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	synthase	deficiency	,	macrocephaly	,	alopecia	,	cutis	laxa	,	and	scoliosis_(MACS	)	syndrome	,	due	to	Ras	and	Rab	interactor	2	(	RIN2	)	mutations	,	transaldolase	deficiency	caused	by	mutations	in	the	transaldolase	1	(	TALDO1	)	gene	,	Gerodermia	osteodysplastica	due	to	mutations	in	the	golgin	,	RAB6-interacting	(	hair_follicle_morphogenesis_or	SCYL1BP1	)	gene	,	and	mitogen	-	activated	pathway	(	MAP	)	kinase	defects	,	caused	by	mutations	in	several	genes	[	protein	tyrosine	phosphatase	,	non	-	receptor	-	type	11	(	PTPN11	)	,	RAF	,	NF	,	HRas	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	HRAS	)	,	B	-	Raf	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	BRAF	)	,	MEK1/2	,	KRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	KRAS	)	,	SOS	Ras	/	Rho	guanine	nucleotide	exchange	factor	2	(	SOS2	)	,	leucine	rich	repeat	scaffold	protein	(	SHOC2	)	,	NRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	NRAS	)	,	and	Raf-1	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	RAF1	)	]	,	which	regulate	the	Ras	-	MAPK	cascade	.	.
s2519	Extensive	search	of	the	literature	revealed	a	potential	key	role	of	genes	at	the	identified	porcine	loci	in	tumor_invasion	(	DST	,	PLEKHA5	,	CBY1	,	LIMK2	and	ETV5	)	and	immune	response	modulation	(	ETV5	,	HERC3	and	production_of_siRNA_involved_in_RNA_interference	)	of	the	progression	phenotypes	.	.
