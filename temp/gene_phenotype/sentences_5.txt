s2003	Mutations	in	the	activation_of_MAPK_activity_gene	,	which	encodes	both	the	cytosolic	and	mitochondrial	isoform	of	lysyl	-	tRNA	synthetase	,	cause	predominantly	neurological	diseases	that	often	involve	deafness	,	but	have	also	been	linked	to	cardiomyopathy	,	developmental	delay	and	lactic_acidosis	.	.
s3758	Our	results	indicated	that	the	homozygous	mutation	c.22C	AAAA	T	was	the	key	genetic	reason	for	the	proband	,	and	a	digenic	effect	of	ion_transmembrane_transport_and	GJB2	might	contributed	to	sensorineural	deafness	.	.

s1067	Through	immunohistochemistry	,	we	found	that	DDX59	protein	expression	correlated	with	Ras	and	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_mutation	status	in	human	lung_adenocarcinoma	.	.
s3702	Although	serum	CK18	,	MMP-9	,	and	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_preop	measurements	in	patients	scheduled	for	curative	surgery	due	to	gastric	adenocarcinoma	did	not	help	to	gain	any	idea	of	tumor_resectability	,	we	concluded	that	our	study	had	valuable	results	in	significantly	predicting	N3	stage	.
s354	In	the	remaining	cases	,	next	generation	sequencing	was	carried	out	revealing	variants	in	a	number	of	other	known	complex	spastic	paraplegia	genes	,	including	five	in	SPG7	(	5/97	)	,	four	in	FA2H	(	also	known	as	SPG35	)	(	4/97	)	and	two	in	ZFYVE26/SPG15	Variants	were	identified	in	genes	usually	associated	with	pure	spastic	paraplegia	and	also	in	the	Parkinson	s	disease	-	associated	gene	ATP13A2	,	neuronal	ceroid	lipofuscinosis	gene	TPP1	and	the	hereditary	motor	and	sensory	neuropathy	maintenance_of_DNA_methylation_gene	,	highlighting	the	genetic	heterogeneity_of	spastic	paraplegia	.	.
s4058	Previous	studies	have	shown	that	response_to_calcium_ion_participates	in	many	cellular	functions	and	has	significant	influence	on	ovarian	,	breast	,	liver	,	and	colorectal	cancer	.	.
s1220	BACKGROUND	Ellis	-	glycoprotein_biosynthetic_process_Creveld	syndrome	is	an	autosomal	recessive	chondro	-	ectodermal	dysplasia	characterized	by	disproportionate	short_stature	,	limb	shortening	,	narrow	chest	,	postaxial	polydactyly	and	dysplastic	nails	and	teeth	.	.
s1088	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_statement	This	review	examines	the	role	of	methionine	adenosyltransferases	(	MATs	)	in	human	cancer_development	,	with	a	particular	focus	on	liver	cancers	in	which	all	three	MAT	genes	are	implicated	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s432	Objective	,	To	investigate	the	genotype	-	phenotype	correlation	in	Chinese	familial	hypertrophic	cardiomyopathy_(HCM	)	focusing	on	the	cardiac	troponin	C	gene	negative_regulation_of_ATPase_activity_c	.	.
s1190	Additionally	,	the	SNP	of	rs57095329	showed	statistical	significances	with	the	appearances	of	mutism_and	the	positive	of	cerebrospinal	fluid	(	CSF	)	protein	14	-	3	-	3	in	sCJD	patients	,	while	the	SNP	of	ZBTB38-MAPK_cascade_was	significantly	related	with	the	appearance	of	myoclonus	in	sCJD	patients	.	.
s2505	CHD	proteins	play	an	important	role	in	neurodevelopment	,	as	pathogenic	variants	in	CHD1	,	CHD2	,	CHD4	,	CHD7	and	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_have	been	associated	with	a	range	of	neurological	phenotypes	,	including	autism	spectrum	disorder	(	ASD	)	,	intellectual	disability	(	ID	)	and	epilepsy	.	.
s1986	We	found	that	histone_methylation_expression	in	tumor_associated	macrophages	correlated	with	STAT3	activation	in	human	HCC	specimens	.	.
s1488	Curcumin	decreased	the	expression	of	steroidogenic	acute	regulatory	proteins	,	C21-steroid_hormone_biosynthetic_process_and	HSD3B2	in	prostate	cancer_cell	lines	,	supporting	the	decrease	of	testosterone	production	.	.
s1210	This	suggests	that	children	with	stress	-	activated_protein_kinase_signaling_cascade	-	related	autosomal_recessive_hydrocephalus	can	have	normal	developmental	outcomes	under	certain	circumstances	.	.
s2456	Conclusions	,	Genetic	polymorphisms	of	MLH3	rs175057	and	DNA_repair_rs13019654	loci	can	predict	the	nCRT	response	,	while	MLH3	rs175057	as	well	as	MSH2	rs3771273	,	rs10188090	and	rs10191478	may	predict	prognosis	in	patients	with	locally	advanced	rectal	cancer_who	received	preoperative	chemoradiotherapy	.	.
s1447	Well	-	established	intrinsic	mechanisms	of	cognitive	decline	include	aging	,	apolipoprotein	E	(	negative_regulation_of_endothelial_cell_proliferation	)	e4	carrier	status	,	SORL1	mutations	,	neuroinflammation	,	mitochondrial_dysfunction	,	amyloid	deposition	,	and	demyelination	.	.
s3121	We	also	found	that	increased	miR	-	negative_regulation_of_cell_adhesion_expression	in	breast	tumors	consistently	correlates	with	increased	patient	survival	.	.
s1959	In	this	review	,	we	discuss	current	data	on	the	functioning	of	the	FGFR	family	proteins	in	both	normal	and	cancer	cells	,	mutations	in	the	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation-4	genes	,	and	mechanisms	underlying	their	oncogenic	potential	,	which	might	be	interesting	to	a	broad	range	of	scientists	searching	for	specific	tumor_markers	and	targeted	anti	-	cancer	drugs	.
s318	Only	four	genetic	midfrequency	deafness_genes	,	namely	,	DFNA10	(	EYA4	)	,	DFNA8/12	(	TECTA	)	,	DFNA13	(	collagen_fibril_organization	)	,	DFNA44	(	CCDC50	)	,	have	been	reported	to	date	.	.
s372	Previous	studies	have	implicated	biological_processed	-	coil	domain	-	containing	protein	8	(	CCDC8	)	as	a	tumor_suppressor	in	several	types	of	cancer	,	such	as	breast	and	prostate	cancers	.	.
s1717	MED1	mediates	induction	of	cell	proliferation	and	migration	and	the	genes	associated	with	it	(	JUN	,	transforming_growth_factor_beta_receptor_signaling_pathway	,	EGFR	,	VEGF	,	MMP1	,	and	ERBB4	)	in	breast	cancer	,	which	is	abrogated	when	used	together	with	miR-191-inhibition	.	.
s2899	In	conclusion	,	SERP2	,	EFEMP2	,	FBN1	,	negative_regulation_of_endothelial_cell_proliferation	,	and	LINC0219	were	revealed	to	be	the	recurrence	-	associated	molecular	and	prognostic	indicators	in	colon	cancer_by	WGCNA	co	-	expression	network	analysis	.
s3553	Of	the	2	204	genes	that	were	mutated	,	APC	,	TTN	,	TP53	,	KRAS	,	OBSCN	,	SOX9	,	cell_adhesion	,	SIGLEC10	,	MYH6	,	and	BRD9	were	consistent	with	genes	being	an	early	driver	of	carcinogenesis	,	in	that	they	were	mutated	in	multiple	adenomas	and	multiple	carcinomas	.	.
s626	In	addition	,	we	found	that	eye_development_regulation	of	RAB3GAP1	,	RAB3GAP2	and	SNAP25	affects	secretion	of	Myocilin	(	MYOC	)	,	a	protein	associated	with	juvenile_onset_glaucoma	and	steroid	-	induced	glaucoma	.	.
s284	The	best	candidate	causal	variants	for	ER(-	)	tumors	lie	in	four	separate	enhancer	elements	,	and	their	risk	alleles	reduce	expression	of	ESR1	,	RMND1	and	biological_process	,	whereas	the	risk	alleles	of	the	strongest	candidates	for	the	remaining	independent	causal	variant	disrupt	a	silencer	element	and	putatively	increase	ESR1	and	RMND1	expression	.	.
s716	In	doxorubicin	-	resistant	breast	cancer_cells	,	RNF6	was	found	to	be	elevated	in	association	with	increased	ERa	and	anti	-	apoptotic	Bcl	-	xL	,	but	not	pro	-	apoptotic	intrinsic_apoptotic_signaling_pathway_in_response_to_DNA_damage-1	.	.
s2833	2-oxoglutarate_metabolic_process_overexpression	increased	the	subpopulation	of	breast	cancer_stem	cells	in	vitro	and	promoted	tumorigenesis	in	mice	.	.
s2065	This	review	summarizes	the	current	knowledge	of	tumorigenesis	and	tumor	progression	in	early	lung_adenocarcinoma	,	with	special	focus	on	its	clinicopathological	characteristics	and	their	associations	with	driver	mutations	(	EGFR	,	KRAS	,	and	protein_phosphorylation	)	as	well	as	on	its	molecular	pathogenesis	and	progression	.
s3130	Mutations	in	skeletal_muscle_contraction_and	MYH8	are	associated	with	distal_arthrogryposis	syndromes	.	.

s3700	We	previously	developed	specific	and	sensitive	anti	-	positive_regulation_of_cell_migration_monoclonal	antibodies	,	PcMab-47	(	mouse	IgG1	,	kappa	)	and	its	mouse	IgG2a	-	type	(	47-mG2a	)	,	both	of	which	were	suitable	for	immunohistochemical	analyses	of	oral	cancers	.	.
s2961	Spinocerebellar	ataxia	type	35	(	SCA35	)	is	a	rare	autosomal	-	dominant	neurodegenerative_disease_caused	by	mutations	in	the	peptide_cross	-	linking_gene	,	which	codes	for	transglutaminase	6	(	TG6	)	.	.
s3583	The	biomarker	panel	and	the	predictive	model	,	when	validated	by	more	samples	in	a	multi	-	center	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templatedting	,	may	be	used	as	an	auxiliary	diagnostic	tool	along	with	imaging	technology	for	lung	cancer_detection	.
s721	Here	,	we	applied	next	-	generation	sequencing	in	89	patients	with	a	clinical	diagnosis	of	distal_renal_tubular_acidosis	,	analyzing	the	prevalence	of	genetic	defects	in	anion_transport	,	ATP6V0A4	,	and	ATP6V1B1	genes	and	the	clinical	phenotype	.	.
s1459	Pre	-	NACT	core	needle	biopsies	and	postoperative	tumor_samples	were	immunohistochemically	stained	for	nuclear	factor	erythroid	2-related	factor	2	(	Nrf2	)	,	Kelch	-	like	ECH	-	associated	protein	1	(	proteasomal_ubiquitin	-	independent_protein_catabolic_process	)	,	thioredoxin	(	Trx	)	,	and	peroxiredoxin	I	(	Prx	I	)	.	.
s621	Alterations	in	eye_development_levels	cause	ocular	malformations	and	disrupt	stress	response	in	ocular	tissues	,	thereby	contributing	to	glaucoma_progression	.	.
s1722	Analysis	of	epithelial_cell_development	-	disrupted	spermatozoa	in	mice	is	difficult	as	Hydin	-	mutant	mice	(	hy3	)	die	within	3	weeks	,	before	sexual	maturation	,	due	to	hydrocephaly	.	.
s3140	Among	the	differentially	expressed	genes	were	oncogenes	,	tumor_suppressors	,	transcription	factors	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	-	related	genes	,	and	members	of	the	WNT	pathway	.	.
s2225	We	previously	demonstrated	that	phospho	-	regulation_of_cell_growth_expression	is	associated	with	tumor	aggressiveness	,	therapy	resistance	,	and	lower	mRNA	expression	of	SLC5A5	in	papillary	thyroid	carcinoma	(	PTC	)	,	while	phospho	-	S6	(	mTORC1	effector	)	expression	was	associated	with	less	aggressive	clinicopathological	features	.	.
s1409	Here	we	perform	an	unbiased	siRNA	screen	and	identify	that	the	second	deubiquitinase	,	regulation_of_autophagy	,	regulates	MCL1	stability	in	lung	and	ovarian	cancer_cells	.	.
s1848	This	bioinformatics	analysis	demonstrated	that	stage	-	related	prognostic	DEGs	,	such	as	cell	-	matrix_adhesion	,	COL1A1	,	COL1A2	,	KRAS	,	and	NRAS	might	play	an	unfavorable	role	in	the	development	as	well	as	metastasis	of	ovarian	cancer	.	.
s1059	We	review	the	literature	of	genetic	PD	autopsies	from	cases	with	molecularly	confirmed	PD	or	parkinsonism_and	summarize	main	findings	on	SNCA	(	n	=	25	)	,	Parkin	(	n	=	20	,	17	bi	-	allelic	and	3	heterozygotes	)	,	PINK1	(	n	=	5	,	1	bi	-	allelic	and	4	heterozygotes	)	,	DJ-1	(	n	=	1	)	,	LRRK2	(	n	=	55	)	,	GBA	(	n	=	10	Gaucher	disease	patients	with	parkinsonism	)	,	DNAJC13	,	GCH1	,	ATP13A2	,	PLA2G6	(	n	=	8	patients	,	2	with	PD	)	,	MPAN	(	n	=	2	)	,	ubiquitin	-	dependent_protein_catabolic_process	,	RAB39B	,	and	ATXN2	(	SCA2	)	,	as	well	as	on	22q	deletion	syndrome	(	n	=	3	)	.	.
s2283	Variants	of	WNK1	(	lysine	deficient	protein	kinase	1	)	,	ADRB2	(	b2	adrenergic	receptor	)	,	NEDD4L	(	ubiquitin	-	protein	ligase	NEDD4-like	)	,	regulation_of_systemic_arterial_blood_pressure_(kallikrein	1	)	contribute	to	hypertension	,	and	AKR1C3	(	aldo	-	keto	reductase	family1	member	C3	)	,	is	associated	with	preeclampsia	.	.

s99	In	summary	,	our	genetic	findings	implicate	homozygous	brain_development_mutations	in	autosomal	-	recessive	intellectual_disability	,	and	their	pathogenic	role	is	strengthened	by	genetic	evidence	and	in	silico	and	in	vitro	functional	analyses	.
s3412	The	promoter	methylation	levels	of	ELMO1	and	ELMO2	were	generally	low	,	whereas	phagocytosis_methylation	levels	were	high	,	in	the	tumor_biopsies	.	.
s1279	However	,	the	global	effects	of	transcription,_DNA	-	templated_expression	in	various	tissues	affected	by	cancer_remain	unknown	.	.
s247	Finally	,	by	immunohistochemical	staining	of	primary	breast	tissue	microarrays	we	find	that	EMSY	/	histone_H3-K9_demethylation	/	SIN3B	complex	subunits	are	frequently	overexpressed	in	primary	breast	cancer_cases	in	a	correlative	manner	.	.
s3527	After	exclusive	analysis	of	10	common	variations	of	three	hearing_loss	-	related	genes	,	GJB2	,	mtDNA12srRNA	and	SLC26A4	,	a	novel	truncated	variant	of	striated_muscle_contraction	,	c.87dupA	(	p	.

s2413	p75NTR	in	HNSCC	might	be	related	with	extrinsic_apoptotic_signaling_pathway_via_death_domain_receptors	-	independent	therapy	resistance	,	while	NTRK1	might	transduce	a	survival	signal	of	NGF	and	contribute	in	this	way	to	improved	tumor_cell	survival	after	cell	cycle	arrest	.
s2807	Mutations	with	milder	presentation	(	homozygous	p	.	D132A	/	EXOSC3	or	protein_phosphorylation	)	may	display	additionally	signs	of	upper	motor	neuron	impairment	,	dystonia	or	ataxia_and	die	at	age	between	5	and	18	years	.	.

s2268	A	preliminary	bioinformatics	analysis	showed	that	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_is	ectopically	expressed	in	glioma	,	and	that	HOXB1	is	a	possible	target	of	miR-3175	.	.
s3002	We	further	identify	small	molecules	that	covalently	target	a	conserved	cysteine	within	the	NR0B1	protein	interaction	domain	,	and	we	demonstrate	that	these	compounds	disrupt	NR0B1	complexes	and	impair	the	anchorage	-	independent	growth	of	proteasomal_ubiquitin	-	independent_protein_catabolic_process	-	mutant	cancer_cells	.	.

s986	RT	-	PCR	analysis	showed	that	the	overall	transcriptional	activity	of	the	main	HS	biosynthesis	-	involved	genes	(	glycosaminoglycan_biosynthetic_process	,	EXT2	,	NDST1	,	NDST2	,	GLCE	,	HS2ST1	,	HS3ST1	,	HS3ST2	,	HS6ST1	,	HS6ST2	,	SULF1	,	SULF2	,	HPSE	)	was	decreased	by	1.5	-	2-fold	in	Grade	II	-	III	glioma	(	p	AAAA	0.01	)	and	by	3-fold	in	Grade	IV	glioma	(	glioblastoma	multiforme	,	GBM	)	(	p	AAAA	0.05	)	,	as	compared	with	the	para	-	tumourous	tissue	.	.
s2958	They	also	provide	the	proof	-	of	-	concept	that	expression	of	the	neuropathy	-	associated	MTMR2	gene	improves	the	protein_dephosphorylation	-	associated	myopathy	,	thus	identifying	MTMR2	as	a	novel	therapeutic	target	for	myotubular	myopathy	.
s3705	However	,	clinical	significance	of	peptidyl	-	threonine_dephosphorylation_as	a	pharmacological	target	in	cancer_therapy	has	not	been	explored	.	.
s329	Here	,	we	have	performed	a	prospective	nationwide	genetic	association	study	using	the	Human	Exome	BeadChip	and	identified	gene	variants	in	encoding	dynactin	4	(	DCTN4	)	,	retinoic	acid	early	transcript	1E	(	RAET1E	)	,	and	V	-	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_murine	thymoma	viral	oncogene	homolog	3	(	AKT3	)	to	be	associated	with	unfavourable	outcome	in	patients	with	pneumococcal	meningitis	.	.

s3640	Expression	profile	analysis	,	immunohistochemical	staining	,	reverse	transcription	-	quantitative	polymerase	chain	reaction	analysis	and	western	blot	analysis	were	performed	to	evaluate	the	levels	of	fatty_acid_metabolic_process_in	liver	cancer_patient	specimens	and	cell	lines	,	subsequently	the	expression	of	MORC2	was	suppressed	or	increased	in	liver	cancer	cells	and	the	effects	of	MORC2	on	the	cancerous	transformation	of	liver	cancer	cells	were	examined	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	.	.
s3918	To	evaluate	whether	germline	variants	in	genes	encoding	pancreatic	secretory	enzymes	contribute	to	pancreatic	cancer_susceptibility	,	we	sequenced	the	coding	regions	of	CPB1	and	other	genes	encoding	pancreatic	secretory	enzymes	and	known	pancreatitis	susceptibility	genes	(	proteolysis	,	CPA1	,	CTRC	,	and	SPINK1	)	in	a	hospital	series	of	pancreatic	cancer	cases	and	controls	.	.
s4026	More	ER	stress	-	inducing	proteolysis_variants	were	also	found	in	the	combined	set	of	hospital	and	familial	cases	with	pancreatic	cancer_than	in	controls	[	7/1,546	vs.	1/2,012	,	P	=	0.025	,	odds	ratio	,	9.36	(	95	%	CI	,	1.15	-	76.02	)	]	.	.
s3208	Loss	of	E	-	integrin	-	mediated_signaling_pathway	,	an	important	cell	-	cell	adhesion	protein	,	contributes	to	tumor_invasion	and	metastasis	.	.
s898	Our	findings	widen	the	phenotype	spectrum	caused	by	biological_process_mutations	and	underline	the	phenotypic	overlap	with	Temtamy	preaxial	brachydactyly_syndrome	.	.
s427	Furthermore	,	we	showed	that	low	-	level	expression	of	LIM2	in	photoreceptor_cell_maintenance	-	high	glioma_was	associated	with	poorer	survival	,	suggesting	that	LIM2	could	be	a	therapeutic	target	for	glioma	expressing	a	high	level	of	CD133	.	.
s1829	Studies	in	humans	with	autosomal_recessive_positive_regulation_of_stress	-	activated_MAPK_cascade_deficiency	have	indicated	a	highly	specific	role	for	this	molecule	in	the	activation	of	antifungal	immune	responses	in	the	central	nervous	system	,	the	oral	mucosa	,	and	the	skin	.	.
s1988	Taken	together	these	data	suggest	that	the	histone_methylation	-	IL6-STAT3	axis	is	an	important	mechanism	of	alcohol	-	associated	tumor_progression	.
s1760	These	compounds	showed	excellent	anti	-	tumor_activity	against	A549	,	Eca-109	,	HeLa	,	HepG2	and	muscle_organ_development-7901	cell	lines	.	.
s2259	The	estrogen	receptor	a	(	ER	)	and	the	progesterone	receptor	(	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	)	are	one	of	the	most	important	prognostic	and	predictive	immunohistochemical	markers	in	breast	cancer	.	.
s312	Like	histone_ubiquitination	,	USP51	and	USP27X	are	required	for	normal	cell	proliferation	,	and	their	depletion	suppresses	tumor_growth	.	.
s2799	The	PCH1sub	-	types	with	early	death	(	between	ages	1	day	and	17	months	)	,	seen	in	patients	with	p	.	G31A	/	EXOSC3	or	SLC25A46	mutations	have	a	spliceosomal_snRNP_assembly_type	1-like	clinical	presentation	but	with	global	developmental	delay	,	visual	and	hearing_impairment	,	with	or	without	microcephaly	,	nystagmus	and	optic	atrophy	.	.
s2274	The	downregulated	expression	of	protein_polyubiquitination-3175	inhibited	cell	proliferation	and	invasion	,	and	promoted	apoptosis	in	glioma	.	.
s3877	FANCM	is	a	DNA	-	biological_process_response	gene	whose	heterozygous	mutations	predispose	to	breast	cancer	.	.
s349	In	the	remaining	cases	,	next	generation	sequencing	was	carried	out	revealing	variants	in	a	number	of	other	known	complex	spastic	paraplegia	genes	,	including	five	in	SPG7	(	5/97	)	,	four	in	FA2H	(	also	known	as	SPG35	)	(	4/97	)	and	two	in	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination	/	SPG15	Variants	were	identified	in	genes	usually	associated	with	pure	spastic	paraplegia	and	also	in	the	Parkinson	s	disease	-	associated	gene	ATP13A2	,	neuronal	ceroid	lipofuscinosis	gene	TPP1	and	the	hereditary	motor	and	sensory	neuropathy	DNMT1	gene	,	highlighting	the	genetic	heterogeneity_of	spastic	paraplegia	.	.
s3342	This	review	highlights	recent	advances	in	understanding	how	the	OVOL1-positive_regulation_of_gene_expression_axis	modulates	cell	differentiation	and	proliferation	in	human	keratinocytes	,	hair	follicles	,	and	benign	or	malignant	skin	tumors	including	squamous_cell_carcinoma_and	malignant	melanoma	.	.
s2462	Taken	together	,	these	results	indicate	that	increased	a	-	actinin-1	expression	destabilizes	E	-	integrin	-	mediated_signaling_pathway	-	based	adhesions	,	which	is	likely	to	promote	the	migratory	potential	of	breast	cancer_cells	.	.
s2135	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	biological_process	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s2086	These	results	support	a	clinical	study	for	the	safety	and	anti	-	tumor_immune	responses	with	combination	therapy	of	IL	PV-10	and	PD-1/immune_response_blockade	.
s3394	X	-	inactive	specific	transcript	(	XIST	)	,	premature_ovarian_failure_1B	(	POF1B	)	and	calmin	(	nuclear_migration	)	were	identified	in	the	DEmRNA	-	DElncRNA	co	-	expression	network	.	.
s2078	Four	of	the	five	genes	,	including	adenylate_cyclase	-	inhibiting_G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway	,	SOPB	,	TCF7L2	,	COL12A1	and	TXNIP	were	downregulated	,	and	were	associated	with	the	OS	of	patients	with	breast	carcinoma	.	.
s985	RT	-	PCR	analysis	showed	that	the	overall	transcriptional	activity	of	the	main	HS	biosynthesis	-	involved	genes	(	EXT1	,	EXT2	,	NDST1	,	NDST2	,	GLCE	,	HS2ST1	,	HS3ST1	,	HS3ST2	,	HS6ST1	,	HS6ST2	,	SULF1	,	positive_regulation_of_Wnt_signaling_pathway	,	HPSE	)	was	decreased	by	1.5	-	2-fold	in	Grade	II	-	III	glioma_(p	AAAA	0.01	)	and	by	3-fold	in	Grade	IV	glioma	(	glioblastoma	multiforme	,	GBM	)	(	p	AAAA	0.05	)	,	as	compared	with	the	para	-	tumourous	tissue	.	.
s647	Significant	down	-	regulation	of	protein_polyubiquitination-193a-3p	was	also	seen	in	an	independent	cohort	of	ulcerative	colitis	cancers	.	.
s2139	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	spermatid_development_and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s2395	Our	findings	indicate	that	BM	-	derived	transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_IIs	from	patients	with	newly	diagnosed	AML	display	phenotypic	and	functional	alterations	such	as	proliferative	deficiency	that	could	be	attributed	to	tumor_progression	,	but	does	not	seem	to	play	a	special	role	in	the	leukemic	process	.
s1476	SCA18	is	a	rare	autosomal	dominant	sensory	/	motor	neuropathy_with	ataxia	(	OMIM#607458	)	associated	with	a	single	missense	variant	c.514	AAAAAG	in	the	interferon	related	developmental	regulator	1	(	myoblast_fate_determination	)	gene	previously	reported	in	a	five	-	generation	American	family	of	Irish	origin	.	.
s2916	By	using	immunohistochemical	and	western	blot	analysis	,	there	is	an	adverse	correlation	between	regulation_of_neuron_apoptotic_process_and	Bim	in	TAM	-	resistant	breast	tumor_tissues	and	MCF-7R	cells	.	.
s2642	Methylation	profiling	,	metabolite	assessment	and	additional	analyses	were	also	performed	in	selected	cases	.	Results	,	One	of	the	11	tumors	was	found	to	carry	a	known	cancer	-	predisposing	somatic_mutation_in	isocitrate_metabolic_process_A	variant	in	GOT2	,	c.357AAAAAT	,	found	in	a	patient	with	multiple	tumors	,	was	associated	with	higher	tumor	mRNA	and	protein	expression	levels	,	increased	GOT2	enzymatic	activity	in	lymphoblastic	cells	,	and	altered	metabolite	ratios	both	in	tumors	and	in	GOT2	knockdown	HeLa	cells	transfected	with	the	variant	.	.
s1408	Here	we	perform	an	unbiased	siRNA	screen	and	identify	that	the	second	deubiquitinase	,	USP13	,	regulates	response_to_cytokine_stability	in	lung	and	ovarian	cancer_cells	.	.
s1031	Moreover	,	our	observations	support	previous	findings	suggesting	that	regulation_of_ferrochelatase_activityNCM	is	a	breast	cancer	-	predisposing	gene	.	.
s4004	We	have	previously	identified	a	role	for	the	secreted	serine	protease	camera	-	type_eye_development_in	ocular	size	determination	and	PRSS56	variants	have	been	implicated	in	the	etiology	of	both	hyperopia	and	myopia	,	highlighting	its	importance	in	refractive	development	.	.
s502	Similar	differences	were	found	among	a	single	gene	group	,	comparing	23	patients	with	positive_regulation_of_cytosolic_calcium_ion_concentration_expansions	(	spinocerebellar	ataxia_6	)	to	22	patients	with	CACNA1A	point	mutations	,	which	had	lower	average	age	at	onset	(	25.2	versus	47.3	years	)	with	longer	disease	duration	(	18.7	versus	10.9	)	,	but	lower	severity	indexes	(	0.39	versus	0.44	)	,	indicating	slower	progression	of	the	disease	.	.
s2315	They	affect	AQP2	,	AQP5	and	cellular_response_to_cAMP	,	where	they	are	associated	with	nephrogenic	diabetes	insipidus	,	keratoderma	and	colorectal	cancer	,	respectively	.	.
s3863	In	A549	lung	cancer_cells	,	which	endogenously	express	CXCR1	,	the	depletion	of	REEP5	and	detection_of_light_stimulus_involved_in_visual_perception_significantly	reduced	growth	and	invasion	by	downregulating	IL-8-stimulated	ERK	phosphorylation	,	actin	polymerization	and	the	expression	of	genes	related	to	metastasis	.	.
s3246	The	RAD51C	pathogenic	variant	c.404	G	AAAA	A	was	identified	in	a	breast	and	ovarian	cancer_family	(	0.7	%	)	,	while	the	strand_invasion_pathogenic	variant	c.694C	AAAA	T	was	described	in	an	ovarian	cancer	family	(	1.3	%	)	.	.
s476	Mutations	in	the	Pejvakin	(	sensory_perception_of_sound	)	gene	cause	autosomal	recessive	hearing_loss_DFNB59	with	audiological	features	of	auditory	neuropathy	spectrum	disorder	(	ANSD	)	or	cochlear	dysfunction	.	.
s2321	Our	aim	was	to	understand	the	role	of	mismatch_repair_in	cancer_prognostication	and	to	establish	a	scoring	system	based	on	the	expressions	of	genes	interacting	with	RNASEH2A.	.
s1350	However	,	there	is	much	debate	over	the	roles	of	the	reversionless	3-like	(	error	-	prone_translesion_synthesis	)	protein	responsible	for	TLS	and	p53	in	regulating	cancer_cell	metabolism	.	.
s295	Global	Ptchd1	deletion	recapitulates	learning	impairment	,	hyper	-	aggression	,	and	motor	defects	,	all	of	which	are	insensitive	to	SK	pharmacological	targeting	and	not	found	in	the	NLS	-	bearing_protein_import_into_nucleus	-	restricted	deletion	mouse	.	.
s1066	In	this	report	,	we	found	that	both	EGFR	and	Ras	signaling	can	upregulate	RNA	helicase	biological_process_in	lung	cancer_cells	.	.
s3958	Here	,	we	show	that	ablating	or	silencing	the	transcription	factor	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_ameliorates	pathology	in	several	forms	of	muscular_dystrophy	.	.
s4011	In	this	study	,	we	found	that	the	activities	of	Notch	signaling	were	elevated	,	while	cell_cycle_arrest_expression	was	decreased	in	CRPC	tissues	compared	with	matched	primary	prostate	cancer_(PPC	)	tissues	.	.
s414	Mutations	in	peripherin	2	(	cell_surface_receptor_signaling_pathway	)	,	also	known	as	retinal_degeneration_slow	/	RDS	,	lead	to	various	retinal	degenerations	including	retinitis	pigmentosa	(	RP	)	and	macular	/	pattern	dystrophy	(	MD	/	PD	)	.	.
s1958	In	this	review	,	we	discuss	current	data	on	the	functioning	of	the	FGFR	family	proteins	in	both	normal	and	cancer_cells	,	mutations	in	the	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation-4	genes	,	and	mechanisms	underlying	their	oncogenic	potential	,	which	might	be	interesting	to	a	broad	range	of	scientists	searching	for	specific	tumor	markers	and	targeted	anti	-	cancer	drugs	.
s2710	She	developed	gastrointestinal	symptoms	,	dysarthria	,	dysphagia	and	weakness	,	and	pyrimidine_nucleoside_metabolic_process_was	considered	due	to	its	low	TP	levels	and	improvement	after	platelet	transfusions	.	.
s3556	Of	the	2	204	genes	that	were	mutated	,	APC	,	TTN	,	TP53	,	KRAS	,	OBSCN	,	SOX9	,	PCDH17	,	SIGLEC10	,	MYH6	,	and	biological_process_were	consistent	with	genes	being	an	early	driver	of	carcinogenesis	,	in	that	they	were	mutated	in	multiple	adenomas	and	multiple	carcinomas	.	.
s2270	In	this	study	,	we	investigated	the	function	of	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_and	the	relationship	between	HOXB1	and	miR-3175	in	glioma	.	.
s1843	Niemann	-	Pick	disease	type	C1	(	protein_glycosylation	)	is	a	rare	autosomal_recessive_lysosomal	storage	disease	primarily	caused	by	mutations	in	NPC1	NPC1	is	characterized	by	abnormal	accumulation	of	unesterified	cholesterol	and	glycolipids	in	late	endosomes	and	lysosomes	.	.
s3087	Brown	-	Vialetto	-	glycoprotein_biosynthetic_process_Laere	syndrome	represents	a	phenotypic	spectrum	of	motor	,	sensory	,	and	cranial	nerve	neuropathy	,	often	with	ataxia	,	optic	atrophy	and	respiratory	problems	leading	to	ventilator	-	dependence	.	.
s1054	We	review	the	literature	of	genetic	PD	autopsies	from	cases	with	molecularly	confirmed	PD	or	parkinsonism_and	summarize	main	findings	on	SNCA	(	n	=	25	)	,	Parkin	(	n	=	20	,	17	bi	-	allelic	and	3	heterozygotes	)	,	PINK1	(	n	=	5	,	1	bi	-	allelic	and	4	heterozygotes	)	,	DJ-1	(	n	=	1	)	,	LRRK2	(	n	=	55	)	,	negative_regulation_of_protein_homooligomerization_(n	=	10	Gaucher	disease	patients	with	parkinsonism	)	,	DNAJC13	,	GCH1	,	ATP13A2	,	PLA2G6	(	n	=	8	patients	,	2	with	PD	)	,	MPAN	(	n	=	2	)	,	FBXO7	,	RAB39B	,	and	ATXN2	(	SCA2	)	,	as	well	as	on	22q	deletion	syndrome	(	n	=	3	)	.	.
s2182	Connexin	31	(	Cx31	)	is	conmelanosome_organizationdered	a	suppressor	for	many	tumors	.	.
s64	The	created	databases	include	ACAD8	(	isobutyryl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	deficiency	(	IBD	)	)	,	branched	-	chain_amino_acid_catabolic_process_(short	-	chain	acyl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	(	SCAD	)	deficiency	)	,	AUH	(	3-methylglutaconic	aciduria	(	3-MGCA	)	)	,	DHCR7	(	Smith	-	Lemli	-	Opitz	syndrome	)	,	HMGCS2	(	3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl	-	CoA	synthase	2	deficiency	)	,	HSD17B10	(	17-beta	-	hydroxysteroid	dehydrogenase	X	deficiency	)	,	FKBP14	(	Ehlers	-	Danlos	syndrome	with	progressive	kyphoscoliosis	,	myopathy	,	and	hearing_loss	,	EDSKMH	)	and	ROGDI	(	Kohlschutter	-	Tonz	syndrome	)	.	.
s450	Moreover	,	it	is	known	that	asparaginyl	-	tRNA_aminoacylation_mutations	cause	various	clinical	phenotypes	,	including	non	-	syndromic	hearing	loss	,	Leigh	syndrome	,	intellectual	disability	with	epilepsy_and	severe	myopathy	.	.
s70	The	created	databases	include	ACAD8	(	isobutyryl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	deficiency	(	IBD	)	)	,	ACADSB	(	short	-	chain	acyl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	(	SCAD	)	deficiency	)	,	AUH	(	3-methylglutaconic	aciduria	(	3-MGCA	)	)	,	DHCR7	(	Smith	-	Lemli	-	Opitz	syndrome	)	,	HMGCS2	(	3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl	-	CoA	synthase	2	deficiency	)	,	HSD17B10	(	17-beta	-	hydroxysteroid	dehydrogenase	X	deficiency	)	,	FKBP14	(	Ehlers	-	Danlos	syndrome	with	progressive	kyphoscoliosis	,	myopathy	,	and	hearing_loss	,	EDSKMH	)	and	brain_development_(Kohlschutter	-	Tonz	syndrome	)	.	.
s399	3-Methylglutaconic	aciduria	is	associated	with	variants	in	genes	encoding	mitochondrial_inner	membrane	organizing	determinants	,	including	TAZ	,	visual_perception	,	SERAC1	and	QIL1/MIC13	.
s3765	The	patient	carried	ion_transport_gene	mutations	found	by	genetic	analysis	,	and	was	finally	diagnosed	with	hyperekplexia	.	.
s1979	Soluble	cell	-	matrix_adhesion_may	represent	a	motility	promoting	molecule	in	cancer_progression	,	a	co	-	factor	for	development	of	tumor	cysts	and	a	target	for	new	treatment	strategies	.
s291	Individuals	with	smoothened_signaling_pathway_deletion	show	symptoms	of	ADHD	,	sleep	disruption	,	hypotonia	,	aggression	,	ASD	,	and	ID	.	.
s2437	The	diagnosis	is	based	on	genetic	criteria	,	by	the	identification	of	inactivating	pathogenic	mutation	of	tumor_suppressor	genes	regulation_of_translation_and	TSC2	,	and	clinical	criteria	,	including	cutaneous	,	renal	,	pulmonary	,	cardiac	and	neurological	manifestations	.	.
s19	These	findings	establish	these	mutant	mice	as	a	suitable	model	system	to	elucidate	how	negative_regulation_of_endopeptidase_activity_deficiency	causes	deafness_in	humans	.
s2915	To	understand	the	mechanism	of	TAM	-	resistance	in	GPER	activated	ER+	breast	cancer	,	the	function	of	regulation_of_neuron_apoptotic_process_and	Bim	inducing	cell	apoptosis	was	studied	.	.
s2101	We	suggest	that	the	combination	of	reduced	positive_regulation_of_DNA_binding	-	H1	,	induced	MACC1	,	and	the	presence	of	tumor_budding	are	promising	biomarkers	for	the	prediction	of	recurrence	and	may	aid	the	stratification	of	patients	with	stage	II	colon	cancer	for	adjuvant	chemotherapy	.
s2198	In	addition	,	the	results	indicated	that	USP18	may	promote	the	epidermal	growth	factor	(	EGF)-mediated	EGF	receptor	(	EGFR)/positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	/	S	-	phase	kinase	-	associated	protein	2	(	Skp2	)	pathway	by	upregulating	EGFR	and	Skp2	in	a	AKT	/	forkhead	box	O3-dependent	manner	in	breast	cancer	.	.
s3026	We	observed	that	the	alternatively	spliced	transcripts	of	a	subset	of	these	genes	,	involved	in	proliferation	and	tumor_cell	migration	like	REPIN1/AP4	,	ST3GAL6	,	TRNAU1AP	and	fructose_6-phosphate_metabolic_process_are	degraded	upon	loss	of	PRMT5	.	.
s2346	Some	of	them	were	cancer	-	related	according	to	COSMIC	and	HGMD	databases	(	no	founder	mutations	in	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination_and	BRCA2	have	been	found	)	.	.
s1797	We	found	that	the	human	colorectal	cancer_cell	line	,	HCT-116	,	displayed	reduced	expression	of	Raf1-connective_tissue_replacement_involved_in_inflammatory_response_wound_healing	,	and	reintroduction	of	Raf1-tr	sensitized	the	cells	to	bleomycin	-	induced	apoptosis	.	.
s1491	In	addition	,	these	regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_RGCs	die	early	in	the	DBA/2J	model	of	glaucoma_than	most	RGCs	.	.
s2736	In	addition	,	4/18	(	18	%	)	of	intraductal	tubulopapillary	neoplasms	had	FGFR2	fusions	(	FGFR2-CEP55	,	FGFR2-SASS6	,	diaphragm_development	-	FGFR2	,	FGFR2-TXLNA	,	and	FGFR2-VCL	)	and	1/18	(	5.5	%	)	had	STRN	-	ALK	fusion	.	.

s1216	A	recurrent	de	novo	missense	variant	within	the	C	-	terminal	Sin3-like	domain	of	regulation_of_axon_guidance_was	previously	reported	to	cause	acromelic	frontonasal	dysostosis	(	AFND	)	,	an	autosomal	-	dominant	severe	frontonasal	and	limb	malformation	syndrome	,	associated	with	neurocognitive	and	motor_delay	,	via	a	proposed	gain	-	of	-	function	effect	.	.
s1333	We	summarize	the	phenotypic	extent	of	smoothened_signaling_pathway/3	syndromes	in	the	literature	and	determine	that	these	2	syndromes	manifest	opposite	features	to	a	certain	extent	,	such	as	midface	hypoplasia	or	macrocephaly	,	and	anterior	or	posterior	side	of	polydactyly	.	.
s932	Recent	research	published	in	the	Journal	of	Pathology	showed	that	genetic	depletion	of	any	of	the	superoxide_metabolic_process_subunits	Cyba	,	Cybb	,	Ncf1	,	Ncf2	and	Ncf4	reduced	the	formation	of	lung	metastases	following	intravenous	injection	of	murine	tumor_cells	.	.
s3464	Gene	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_enrichment	analysis	was	conducted	to	study	the	relevant	mechanisms	.	Bladder	cancer	patients	in	COL5A2	low	expression	group	were	associated	with	better	invasiveness	(	P	AAAA	.0001	)	,	tumor_grade	(	P	=	.001	)	,	T	staging	(	P	AAAA	.0001	)	,	N	staging	(	P	=	.002	)	,	cancer	specific	survival	(	P	AAAA	.0001	)	,	overall	survival	(	P	AAAA	.0001	)	,	and	a	trend	of	better	M	staging	(	P	=	.053	)	than	those	in	COL5A2	high	expression	group	.

s3953	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	negative_regulation_of_I	-	kappaB_kinase	/	NF	-	kappaB_signaling	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s3652	In	the	present	study	,	the	results	of	immumohistochemisty	revealed	that	the	positive	staining	rates	of	cerebral_cortex_development	,	NF	-	kB	p65	and	NF	-	kB	p	-	p65	in	gastric	cancer_tissues	were	obviously	higher	than	those	in	normal	tissues	.	.
s1413	Collectively	,	we	nominate	USP13	as	a	novel	deubiquitinase	which	regulates	response_to_cytokine_turnover	in	diverse	solid	tumors	and	propose	that	USP13	may	be	a	potential	therapeutic	target	for	the	treatment	of	various	malignancies	.
s744	Hyper	-	methylated	CpG	loci	included	the	known	the	tumor_suppressor	gene	RET	(	p	=	5.72	x	10	-	10	)	,	as	well	as	loci	in	differentially	methylated	regions	for	GSG1L	,	MIR4493	,	axonogenesis	,	MCIDAS	,	ZNF568	,	and	RERG	.	.
s2760	Our	findings	provide	exploratory	evidence	for	hypermethylation	of	the	key	tumour_suppressor	gene	cellular_response_to_DNA_damage_stimulus_being	implicated	in	smoking	-	associated	colorectal	carcinogenesis	.	.
s2762	5	-Aza-2	-deoxycytidine	(	5-Aza	-	neuron_migration	)	is	a	demethylating	drug	that	causes	genome	-	wide	hypomethylation	resulting	in	the	expression	of	several	tumor	suppressor	genes	causing	growth	arrest	of	cancer_cells	.	.
s259	Here	we	show	that	the	microphthalmia	-	associated	transcription	factor	,	MITF	,	which	plays	a	central	role	in	the	development	and	function	of	RPE	cells	,	regulates	the	expression	of	two	visual	cycle	genes	,	retinoid_metabolic_process_which	encodes	retinaldehyde	binding	protein-1	(	RLBP1	)	,	and	Rdh5	,	which	encodes	retinol	dehydrogenase-5	(	RDH5	)	.	.
s87	Transcripts	of	Prss56	,	a	gene	associated	with	angle	-	closure	glaucoma	,	posterior	microphthalmia_and	myopia	,	were	increased	in	embryo_development_ending_in_birth_or_egg_hatchingrd6	eyes	by	17-fold	.	.
s3117	Breakthrough	discoveries	include	the	role	of	somatic	variants	in	the	KCNJ5	,	CACNA1D	,	ATP1A1	,	and	ATP2B3	genes	as	causes	of	aldosterone	-	producing	adenomas	(	APAs	)	,	and	the	recognition	of	three	novel	hyperaldosteronism_syndromes	with	germline	variants	in	the	KCNJ5	,	CACNA1D	,	and	regulation_of_membrane_potential_genes	.	.
s2852	TBXAS1	mutations	result	in	Ghosal	hematodiaphyseal	dysplasia	(	OMIM	231095	)	,	the	autosomal_recessive_syndrome	associated	with	abnormal	bone	structure	and	negative_regulation_of_autophagy	.	.
s3264	However	,	in	HaCaT	and	HEK293	T	cells	that	display	transformed	phenotypes	,	but	do	not	originate	from	patient	-	derived	tumors	,	the	ER	stress	-	inducing	treatments	resulted	in	an	upregulation	of	negative_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_and	HKDC1	,	but	not	KRT16	transcripts	,	By	a	luciferase	reporter	approach	we	identified	a	highly	active	ATF4-responsive	element	within	the	upstream	region	of	the	KRT16	gene	.	.
s2850	This	study	demonstrates	that	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_variants	are	associated	with	syndromic	obesity_in	humans	.	.
s3873	Genetic	screening	of	patients	diagnosed	with	macular_dystrophy_disclosed	a	novel	mutation	in	the	positive_regulation_of_guanylate_cyclase_activity_gene	,	namely	a	c.526C	AAAA	T	substitution	leading	to	the	amino	acid	substitution	p	.

s3715	magnesium_ion_homeostasis_and	NT5C2	are	genes	recently	identified	as	susceptibility	genes	for	schizophrenia_in	Europeans	,	but	the	exact	mechanism	by	which	these	genes	confer	risk	for	schizophrenia	remains	unknown	.	.
s3947	In	particular	,	MYH9	mutations	result	in	congenital	macrothrombocytopenia	and	predispose	to	kidney	failure	,	hearing_loss	,	and	cataracts	,	MPL	and	MECOM	mutations	cause	congenital	thrombocytopenia	evolving	into	bone	marrow	failure	,	whereas	thrombocytopenias	caused	by	RUNX1	,	ANKRD26	,	and	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_mutations	are	characterized	by	predisposition	to	hematological	malignancies	.	.
s3643	In	a	model	of	nude	mice	,	the	overexpression	of	fatty_acid_metabolic_process_promoted	tumorigenicity	and	markedly	enhanced	pulmonary	metastasis	of	liver	cancer	.	.
s2264	Mutations	in	IDH1	and	isocitrate_metabolic_process_have	recently	been	observed	in	multiple	tumors	,	including	gliomas	,	acute	myeloid	leukemia	,	myelodysplastic	syndromes	,	and	chondrosarcoma	.	.
s829	For	in	vitro	studies	,	inhibition	of	proline_biosynthetic_process_by	small	-	hairpin	RNA	significantly	reduced	the	growth	and	invasion	capabilities	of	the	cells	,	while	enhancing	the	cytotoxicity	of	doxorubicin	in	breast	cancer_cell	lines	MCF-7	(	ER	positive	)	and	MDA	-	MB-231	(	ER	negative	)	.	.
s2010	Importantly	,	bone	cell	activity	was	inversely	correlated	to	tumor_cell	AR	activity	(	measured	as	AR	,	FOXA1	,	HOXB13	,	KLK2	,	KLK3	,	NKX3	-	1	,	Golgi_to_plasma_membrane_transport	,	and	TMPRSS2	expression	)	and	to	patient	serum	prostate	-	specific	antigen	(	PSA	)	levels	.	.
s1500	A	replicative	analysis	of	associations	of	15	SNPs	located	in	the	regions	of	11	genes	(	TCF4	,	protein_autophosphorylation	,	NOTCH4	,	ZNF804A	,	AGBL1	,	RELN	,	ZFP64P1	,	KCNB2	,	CSMD1	,	CPVL	,	NRIP1	)	and	three	intergenic	regions	(	SLCO6A1/LINCOO491	,	LOC105376248/LOC105376249	,	SPA17/NRGN	)	with	schizophrenia_was	conducted	in	the	Russian	population	of	the	Siberian	region	.	.
s921	The	HECT	-	type	ubiquitin	ligase	HECT	,	UBA	and	WWE	Domain	Containing	1	,	(	HUWE1	)	regulates	key	cancer	-	related	pathways	,	including	the	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_oncogene	.	.
s1635	Five	individuals	who	carry	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_nonsense	variants	resulting	in	a	premature	stop	codon	display	severe	neurodevelopmental	regression	,	hypotonia	,	progressive	ataxia	,	seizures	,	and	a	lack	of	coordination	.	.
s3849	Our	data	suggest	that	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	-	AS1	may	play	some	role	during	cancer_occurrence	and	progression	and	may	be	a	new	biomarker	for	HCC	.
s3086	Brown	-	Vialetto	-	glycoprotein_biosynthetic_process_Laere	syndrome	represents	a	phenotypic	spectrum	of	motor	,	sensory	,	and	cranial	nerve	neuropathy	,	often	with	ataxia	,	optic	atrophy	and	respiratory	problems	leading	to	ventilator	-	dependence	.	.
s2610	The	ID2	gene	expression	was	increased	in	the	most	advanced	stage	of	endometriosis_and	in	ovarian	endometriomas	,	the	skeletal_system_development_was	more	expressed	in	peritoneal	lesions	,	and	the	SMOC2	was	highly	expressed	in	both	peritoneal	and	endometrioma	lesions	.	.
s1587	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_overexpression	accelerates	growth	of	Wilms	tumor_cells	in	vitro	and	induces	neoplastic	growth	in	the	developing	mouse	kidney	in	vivo	.	.
s509	Our	results	therefore	confirm	the	protein_tetramerizationR423H	allele	as	causative	for	SCA13	,	through	a	dominant	negative	effect	on	KCNC3WT	and	links	with	EGFR	that	account	for	dominant	inheritance	,	congenital	onset	,	and	disease	pathology	.
s688	Cystinuria	is	a	heterogeneous	,	rare	but	important	cause	of	inherited	kidney	stone	disease	due	to	mutations	in	2	genes	,	amino_acid_transport_and	SLC7A9	.	.
s4002	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_overexpression	greatly	enhanced	HCC	cell	capability	for	tumorsphere	formation	,	invasion	and	chemoresistance	in	vitro	,	whereas	inhibiting	ZNF687	reduced	these	capabilities	and	inhibited	HCC	cell	tumorigenic	capability	in	vivo	.	.
s1016	Over	the	last	5	years	,	several	single	gene	disorders	of	the	autophagy	pathway	have	emerged	,	EPG5-associated	Vici	syndrome	,	WDR45-associated	b	-	propeller	protein	-	associated	neurodegeneration	,	SNX14-associated	autosomal	-	recessive	spinocerebellar	ataxia_20	,	autophagy	-	associated	autosomal	-	recessive	ataxia	syndrome	,	SQSTM1/p62-associated	childhood	-	onset	neurodegeneration	,	and	several	forms	of	the	hereditary	spastic	paraplegias	.	.
s1791	Although	some	recent	studies	suggest	that	the	obesity	-	related	SNPs	in	FTO	influence	obesity	susceptibility	likely	through	altering	the	expression	of	the	adjacent	genes	such	as	IRX3	and	negative_regulation_of_G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway	,	rather	than	FTO	itself	,	a	solid	link	between	the	SNP	risk	genotype	and	the	increased	FTO	expression	in	both	human	blood	cells	and	fibroblasts	has	been	reported	.	.
s1359	Among	these	genes	,	mutations	in	double	-	strand_break_repair_gene	involve	in	inclusion	body	myopathy	with	Paget	disease	of	bone	and	frontotemporal_dementia_(IBMPFD	)	,	familial	amyotrophic	lateral	sclerosis	(	ALS	)	,	autism	spectrum	disorders	(	ASD	)	,	and	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	(	HSP	)	.	.
s3323	We	here	report	on	the	existence	of	Leber	s	hereditary	optic	neuropathy_(LHON	)	associated	with	peculiar	combinations	of	individually	non	-	pathogenic	missense	mitochondrial	DNA	(	mtDNA	)	variants	,	affecting	the	fatty_acid_biosynthetic_process	-	ND4	,	MT	-	ND4L	and	MT	-	ND6	subunit	genes	of	Complex	I.	.
s2726	However	,	certain	chromatin	remodeling	genes	(	MLL1	,	MLL2	,	MLL3	,	cell_adhesion	,	PBRM1	,	EED	,	and	ATRX	)	were	found	to	be	mutated	in	7/22	(	32	%	)	of	intraductal	tubulopapillary	neoplasms	and	27	%	harbored	phosphatidylinositol	3-kinase	(	PI3	K	)	pathway	(	PIK3CA	,	PIK3CB	,	INPP4A	,	and	PTEN	)	mutations	.	.
s2174	Taken	together	,	these	results	indicate	that	increased	a	-	actinin-1	expression	destabilizes	E	-	integrin	-	mediated_signaling_pathway	-	based	adhesions	,	which	is	likely	to	promote	the	migratory	potential	of	breast	cancer_cells	.	.
s537	We	previously	found	negative_regulation_of_platelet_aggregation_as	frequently	methylated	tumor_suppressor	gene	(	TSG	)	for	multiple	carcinomas	,	however	,	its	biological	functions	and	underlying	molecular	mechanisms	in	breast	carcinogenesis	remain	unknown	.	.
s2391	In	addition	,	TNFSF15/DR3	signaling	pathways	in	A549	cells	include	activation	of	peripheral_nervous_system_development	-	kB	during	tumor_lymphangiogenesis	.	.
s587	Gene	-	based	tests	highlighted	20	additional	genes	of	which	5	had	previously	been	associated	to	schizophrenia_and	/	or	bipolar	disorder	,	CSMD1	,	CCDC141	,	SLC1A2	,	positive_regulation_of_cytosolic_calcium_ion_concentration	,	and	SNAP25	.	.
s2698	The	data	implying	there	could	be	a	lower	association	of	some	specific	creatine_biosynthetic_process_gene	variants	with	autism_is	an	observation	that	would	need	to	be	corroborated	in	a	larger	group	of	autism	patients	,	and	with	sub	-	populations	of	Asian	ethnicities	.	.
s1698	However	,	the	molecular	and	phenotypic	consequences	of	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_expression	in	hepatoblastoma_are	not	fully	understood	.	.
s3576	Conclusions	,	The	expression	of	HOXA11-positive_regulation_of_T_cell_mediated_cytotoxicity_is	upregulated	in	esophageal	cancer_cell	lines	and	tissues	.	.
s2868	The	major	allele	of	SNP	rs3173615	is	a	risk	factor	in	sporadic_FTD	,	whereas	the	minor	allele	seems	protective	in	neutrophil_degranulation-	and	C9orf72-mediated	FTD	.	.
s2668	FLNB	-	related	disorders	are	classified	as	spondylocarpotarsal	synostosis	(	brain_development	)	,	Larsen	syndrome	(	LS	)	,	atelosteogenesis	(	AO	)	,	boomerang	dysplasia	(	BD	)	,	and	isolated	congenital	talipes	equinovarus	,	presenting	with	scoliosis	,	short	-	limbed_dwarfism	,	clubfoot	,	joint	dislocation	and	other	unique	skeletal	abnormalities	.	.
s317	Only	four	genetic	midfrequency	deafness_genes	,	namely	,	DFNA10	(	EYA4	)	,	DFNA8/12	(	cell	-	matrix_adhesion	)	,	DFNA13	(	COL11A2	)	,	DFNA44	(	CCDC50	)	,	have	been	reported	to	date	.	.
s1442	By	using	quantitative	(	real	-	time	)	PCR	,	western	blot	analysis	,	and	immunocytochemical	staining	,	three	non	-	small	cell	lung	cancer_(NSCLC	)	cell	lines	(	A427	,	A549	and	NCI	-	H358	)	were	analyzed	for	the	expression	of	defense_response_to_bacteriumR	and	its	specific	downstream	signaling	pathways	[	Janus	kinase	2	(	Jak2)-signal	transducer	and	activator	of	transcription	5	(	STAT5	)	,	phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase	(	PI3K)-Akt	,	mitogen	-	activated	protein	(	MAP	)	kinase	]	.	.
s3542	In	these	5	families	,	we	detected	one	reported	and	six	novel	mutations	in	5	different	deafness_autosomal	recessive	(	DFNB	)	genes	(	positive_regulation_of_substrate_adhesion	-	dependent_cell_spreading	,	LHFPL5	,	CDH23	,	PCDH15	,	and	MYO7A	)	.	.
s2803	The	PCH1sub	-	types	with	early	death	(	between	ages	1	day	and	17	months	)	,	seen	in	patients	with	p	.	G31A	/	rRNA_processing_or	SLC25A46	mutations	have	a	SMA	type	1-like	clinical	presentation	but	with	global	developmental	delay	,	visual	and	hearing	impairment	,	with	or	without	microcephaly	,	nystagmus	and	optic_atrophy	.	.
s2033	In	this	study	,	we	found	XIST	expresmelanosome_organizationon	level	was	upregulated	in	colon	cancer_tissues	and	cell	lines	.	.
s2862	Mutations	affecting	human	COG1	,	intra	-	Golgi_vesicle	-	mediated_transport_and	COG4-COG8	cause	monogenic	forms	of	inherited	,	autosomal_recessive_CDGs	.	.
s3822	We	find	that	lung	squamous_cell_carcinoma_(SQCC	)	,	which	accounts	for	~20	%	of	lung	cancer	,	exhibits	increased	expression	of	the	phosphorylation_subunit	PIK3R2	,	which	is	at	low	expression	levels	in	normal	tissues	.	.
s2289	Our	findings	demonstrate	that	variants	disrupting	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	-	mediated	transcriptional	regulation	cause	intellectual_disability_and	developmental	delay	and	are	present	in	a0.1	%	of	individuals	with	unexplained	neurodevelopmental	disorders	.
s4073	In	A549	lung	cancer_cells	,	which	endogenously	express	CXCR1	,	the	depletion	of	REEP5	and	REEP6	significantly	reduced	growth	and	invasion	by	downregulating	response_to_molecule_of_bacterial_origin	-	stimulated	ERK	phosphorylation	,	actin	polymerization	and	the	expression	of	genes	related	to	metastasis	.	.
s2122	Whole	genome	transcriptome	analysis	(	RNA	-	Seq	)	on	RNA	isolated	from	wildtype	larvae	and	larvae	with	eye	defects	that	were	putative	homozygotes	for	the	foxe3	indel	variant	found	significant	dysregulation	of	genes	expressed	in	the	lens	and	eye	whose	orthologues	are	associated	with	cataracts_in	human	patients	,	including	cryba2a	,	cryba1l1	,	mipa	and	cellular_response_to_heat	.	.
s3910	In	humans	,	mutations	in	regulation_of_autophagy_result	in	Wolfram	syndrome	2	,	a	disease	in	which	the	patients	display	juvenile	diabetes	,	neuropsychiatric	disorders	and	defective_platelet_aggregation	.	.
s2029	Taken	together	,	these	data	reveal	that	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_serves	as	a	positive	regulator	of	aerobic	glycolysis	via	suppressing	of	the	FBP1	in	pancreatic	cancer_cells	.	.
s2877	The	results	revealed	that	the	most	biological_process	-	specific	proteins	were	associated	with	events	involved	in	tumor	development	,	while	chemotherapy	in	the	PS	group	was	associated	with	side	effects	of	drugs	and/or	cancer_recurrence	.	.
s1040	Thus	,	the	aim	of	the	present	study	was	to	elucidate	the	influence	of	interleukin-12-mediated_signaling_pathway_upregulation	on	colon	cancer_cell	line	after	treatment	with	5-FU	.	.
s3594	Lynch	syndrome	,	a	hereditary	cancer_syndrome	,	occurs	because	of	germline	mutations	in	at	least	one	of	four	DNA	mismatch	repair	genes	(	MutL	Homolog	1	(	MLH1	)	,	MutS	Homolog	2	(	MSH2	)	,	MutS	Homolog	6	(	MSH6	)	,	and	PMS1	Homolog	2	(	mismatch_repair	)	)	.	.
s1997	Mutations	in	mitochondrial_genome_maintenance	-	coding	gene	lead	to	severe	mitochondrial	syndromes	characterized	by	external	ophthalmoplegia	,	emaciation	,	and	respiratory	failure	in	humans	.	.
s3805	These	data	do	not	support	a	causal	relationship	of	variants	in	sensory_perception_of_sound_to	sensorineural	hearing_loss	.	.
s103	We	validated	ZBTB20	,	mRNA_splice_site_selection	,	PARD3	,	AKAP13	and	WAC	,	which	were	identified	by	our	screens	in	multiple	cancer_types	,	as	new	tumor	suppressor	genes	in	prostate	cancer	.	.
s3820	Oncogenic	mutations	in	the	phosphorylation	/	AKT	pathway	are	present	in	nearly	half	of	human	tumors	.	.
s3729	The	PCH1sub	-	types	with	early	death	(	between	ages	1	day	and	17	months	)	,	seen	in	patients	with	p	.	G31A	/	rRNA_processing_or	SLC25A46	mutations	have	a	SMA	type	1-like	clinical	presentation	but	with	global	developmental	delay	,	visual	and	hearing	impairment	,	with	or	without	microcephaly	,	nystagmus	and	optic	atrophy	.	.
s3645	Particularly	,	activation_of_innate_immune_response_expression	was	statistically	higher	in	tumors	with	greater	tumor	invasion	depth	.	.
s1669	Also	the	well	-	known	gene	variants	rs7903146	in	TCF7L2	,	and	rs17817449	in	DNA_dealkylation_involved_in_DNA_repair	,	were	nominally	associated	with	hyperglycemia_(rs7903146	)	,	as	well	as	with	higher	fasting	insulin	levels	(	rs17817449	)	.	.
s4031	NGLY1	patients	produce	little	or	no	N	-	glycanase	(	glycoprotein_catabolic_process	)	,	and	the	symptoms	include	global	developmental	delay	,	frequent	seizures	,	complex	hyperkinetic	movement_disorder	,	difficulty	in	swallowing	/	aspiration	,	liver	dysfunction	,	and	a	lack	of	tears	.	.
s65	The	created	databases	include	ACAD8	(	isobutyryl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	deficiency	(	IBD	)	)	,	ACADSB	(	short	-	chain	acyl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	(	SCAD	)	deficiency	)	,	fatty_acid_beta	-	oxidation_(3-methylglutaconic	aciduria	(	3-MGCA	)	)	,	DHCR7	(	Smith	-	Lemli	-	Opitz	syndrome	)	,	HMGCS2	(	3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl	-	CoA	synthase	2	deficiency	)	,	HSD17B10	(	17-beta	-	hydroxysteroid	dehydrogenase	X	deficiency	)	,	FKBP14	(	Ehlers	-	Danlos	syndrome	with	progressive	kyphoscoliosis	,	myopathy	,	and	hearing_loss	,	EDSKMH	)	and	ROGDI	(	Kohlschutter	-	Tonz	syndrome	)	.	.
s152	Two	recent	reports	describe	a	new	syndrome	of	intellectual	disability	,	short_stature	,	microcephaly	,	and	young	onset	diabetes	or	disturbed	glucose	metabolism	in	association	with	inactivating	mutations	in	the	tRNA_methylation_gene	.	.
s42	Friedreich	ataxia_(FRDA	)	is	the	most	frequent	progressive	autosomal	recessive	disorder	associated	with	unstable	expansion	of	glycogen_catabolic_process_trinucleotide	repeats	in	the	first	intron	of	the	FXN	gene	,	which	encodes	for	the	mitochondrial	frataxin	protein	.	.
s3430	Here	the	authors	show	that	human	microcephaly_protein	centriole_replication_directly	interacts	with	STIL	and	acts	downstream	of	STIL	-	mediated	centriole	assembly	,	contributing	to	building	full	-	length	centrioles	.
s3679	Depletion	of	positive_regulation_of_cell_death_and	GSALDH	in	humans	leads	to	hyperprolinemia	,	which	is	associated	with	mental	disorders	such	as	schizophrenia	.	.
s3455	Immunoblot	analysis	revealed	that	peptidyl	-	threonine_phosphorylation_protein	expression	was	notably	decreased	in	gastric	cancer_compared	with	normal	tissues	.	.
s2748	We	report	4	cases	of	acute	severe	VZV	infection	affecting	the	central_nervous	system	or	the	lungs	in	unrelated	,	otherwise	healthy	children	who	are	heterozygous	for	rare	missense	mutations	in	positive_regulation_of_interferon	-	beta_production_(one	patient	)	,	POLR3C	(	one	patient	)	,	or	both	(	two	patients	)	.	.
s3476	In	summary	,	a	15-lncRNA	expression	signature	(	BAIAP2-AS1	,	RP11	-	203J24.8	,	LINC01133	,	positive_regulation_of_ARF_protein_signal_transduction-7G5.6	,	RP11	-	147L13.15	,	SERHL	,	CTC-537E7.3	,	RP11	-	440L14.1	,	RP11	-	131N11.4	,	ILF3-AS1	,	RP11	-	80H18.4	,	RP11	-	1096G20.5	,	CTD-2192J16.26	,	RP11	-	621L6.3	,	and	RP11	-	571M6.18	)	were	identified	and	validated	which	can	predict	cervical	cancer_patient	survival	.	.
s530	The	effect	of	garlic	extract	in	cancer_prevention	was	evaluated	using	the	T24	BC	BALB	/	C	-	establishment_of_mitotic_spindle_orientation_mouse	xenograft	model	.	.
s641	Here	we	investigated	roles	for	the	vertebrate	-	specific	BTB	domain	zinc	finger	gene	regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_in	the	context	of	human	brain	tumors	.	.
s2808	Other	rRNA_processing_mutations	and	EXOSC8	cases	are	intermediate	;	SMA	type	1-like	presentation	,	spasticity_(mostly	in	EXOSC8	)	and	death	between	3	months	and	5	years	.	.
s2937	In	the	present	study	,	with	the	aim	of	reducing	the	cost	of	utilizing	growth	factors	in	cancer_research	,	a	simple	and	efficient	method	for	the	preparation	of	recombinant	human	(	rh)positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_in	Escherichia	coli	was	established	.	.
s3167	CIB2	and	gap_junction_assembly_genes	variants	contribute	significantly	in	familial	cases	of	prelingual	recessive	hearing_loss_(HL	)	.	.
s1308	Here	,	we	report	a	novel	hemizygous	transition	c.975GAAAAA	(	p	.	Trp325	)	in	cochlea_morphogenesis_gene	(	Xq21	)	found	in	two	deaf	half	-	brothers	from	one	Yakut	family	(	Eastern	Siberia	,	Russia	)	with	identical	inner	ear	abnormalities	(	AAAAAAcorkscrewAAAAAA	cochlea	with	an	absence	of	modiolus	)	specific	to	X	-	linked	deafness-2	(	DFNX2	)	.	.
s1183	In	conclusion	,	the	present	results	suggested	that	CCBE1	and	cell	-	matrix_adhesion_may	have	potential	as	biomarkers	for	the	identification	of	lung	cancer_patients	at	a	high	risk	of	LNM	.
s1693	Exome	analysis	of	APA	has	allowed	the	identification	of	recurrent	somatic	mutations	in	KCNJ5	,	CACNA1D	,	cellular_sodium_ion_homeostasis	,	and	ATP2B3	in	more	than	50	%	of	sporadic_cases	.	.
s3927	Among	familial	pancreatic	cancer_cases	,	ER	stress	-	inducing	proteolysis_variants	were	found	in	4	of	593	(	0.67	%	)	vs.	.
s1020	PurposeMonoallelic	germ	-	line	mutations	in	the	BRCA1/FANCS	,	BRCA2/mitotic_cytokinesis_and	PALB2/FANCN	genes	confer	high	risk	of	breast	cancer	.	.
s2418	Using	several	genetic	mouse	models	of	PDAC	,	we	detected	a	marked	increase	in	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_expression	in	muscle	undergoing	cachexia	.	.
s1731	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	B_cell_receptor_signaling_pathway	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s3456	Immunohistochemistry	demonstrated	that	the	loss	of	peptidyl	-	threonine_phosphorylation_expression	,	which	was	observed	in	50.8	%	of	primary	gastric	cancer	tissues	(	n=128	)	,	significantly	correlated	with	advanced	tumor_stage	(	PAAAA0.001	)	,	frequent	lymph	node	metastasis	(	PAAAA0.001	)	,	distant	metastasis	(	P=0.013	)	,	tumor	differentiation	(	P=0.004	)	and	unfavorable	overall	survival	(	PAAAA0.001	)	.	.
s830	Further	population	study	also	validated	that	chemotherapy	significantly	improved	survival	in	early	-	stage	breast	cancer_patients	with	low	proline_biosynthetic_process_expression	levels	.	.
s1879	In	humans	,	sensory_perception_of_sound_mutations	cause	autosomal	recessive	nonsyndromic	deafness_(DFNB79	)	by	an	unknown	mechanism	.	.
s3532	Up	-	regulation	of	intrinsic_apoptotic_signaling_pathway_in_response_to_oxidative_stress	/	DIABLO	has	been	shown	to	increase	tumor_cell	chemotherapy	sensitivity	.	.
s3396	However	,	the	clinicopathological	implication	of	protein_polyubiquitination-23b-3p	in	hepatocellular_carcinoma_(HCC	)	remains	unclear	.	.
s260	Here	we	show	that	the	microphthalmia	-	associated	transcription	factor	,	MITF	,	which	plays	a	central	role	in	the	development	and	function	of	RPE	cells	,	regulates	the	expression	of	two	visual	cycle	genes	,	Rlbp1	which	encodes	retinaldehyde	binding	protein-1	(	retinoid_metabolic_process	)	,	and	Rdh5	,	which	encodes	retinol	dehydrogenase-5	(	RDH5	)	.	.
s2192	The	bioinformatics	analysis	and	experimental	results	of	the	present	study	demonstrated	that	aberrant	promoter	methylation	led	to	increased	expression	of	regulation_of_inflammatory_response_in	breast	cancer	.	.
s2867	Single	-	nucleotide	polymorphisms	in	the	lysosome_localization_gene	have	been	identified	as	a	risk	factor	in	frontotemporal_dementia_(FTD	)	.	.
s73	Here	we	identify	mutations	in	the	genes	encoding	PLK4	kinase	,	a	master	regulator	of	centriole	duplication	,	and	its	substrate	microtubule_nucleation_in	individuals	with	microcephalic	primordial	dwarfism_and	additional	congenital	anomalies	,	including	retinopathy	,	thereby	extending	the	human	phenotypic	spectrum	associated	with	centriole	dysfunction	.	.
s634	Functional	studies	have	elucidated	the	role	of	the	mammalian	target	of	rapamycin	(	regulation_of_cell_growth	)	pathway	in	breast	carcinogenesis	,	but	to	date	,	there	is	a	paucity	of	data	on	its	contribution	to	breast	cancer_risk	in	women	of	African	ancestry	.	.
s1847	Early	postnatal	overnutrition	in	humans	is	associated	with	long	-	term	negative	outcomes	including	obesity	,	increased	risk	of	cardiac_muscle_tissue_development	-	II	diabetes	,	and	cardiovascular_disease	.	.
s1803	The	gene	expression	levels	of	Ki-67	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	FOXC1	,	HOXD13	,	PCDHGB7	and	her-2	were	used	as	an	auxiliary	diagnostic	index	for	patients	with	breast	cancer_in	the	early	stage	.	.
s2776	Interestingly	,	the	naturally	occurring	microcephaly	-	associated	mutant	,	RTTN	(	A578P	)	,	shows	a	low	affinity	for	centrosome_duplication_binding	and	blocks	centriole	assembly	.	.
s3036	Whole	exome	sequencing	identified	a	truncating	pathogenic	variant	in	modulation_of_chemical_synaptic_transmission_at	NM_001111125.2	,	c.2679_2680insA	,	p.(D894fs	10	)	,	a	recently	identified	cause	of	epileptic	encephalopathy_in	females	(	MIM	300522	)	.	.
s2697	In	summary	,	there	were	no	apparent	associations	of	variants	in	GAMT	and	creatine_transmembrane_transport_genes	with	autism	.	.
s2875	The	biological_process	-	specific	hubs	were	involved	in	Wnt	SP	,	signaling	by	Notch1	in	cancer	,	telomere	maintenance	,	and	transcriptional	misregulation	.	.
s2414	p75NTR	in	HNnegative_regulation_of_peptidase_activity_might	be	related	with	NGF	-	independent	therapy	resistance	,	while	NTRK1	might	transduce	a	survival	signal	of	NGF	and	contribute	in	this	way	to	improved	tumor_cell	survival	after	cell	cycle	arrest	.
s2798	The	PCH1sub	-	types	with	early	death	(	between	ages	1	day	and	17	months	)	,	seen	in	patients	with	p	.	G31A	/	EXOSC3	or	mitochondrial_membrane_fission_mutations	have	a	SMA	type	1-like	clinical	presentation	but	with	global	developmental	delay	,	visual	and	hearing_impairment	,	with	or	without	microcephaly	,	nystagmus	and	optic	atrophy	.	.
s1141	Using	this	gene	panel	,	we	were	able	to	identify	disease	-	causing	variants	in	17	out	of	87	(	19.5	%	)	analyzed	patients	,	all	found	in	known	epilepsy	-	associated	genes	(	KCNQ2	,	CDKL5	,	STXBP1	,	SCN1A	,	PCDH19	,	POLG	,	SLC2A1	,	protein_sumoylation	,	ALG13	,	CHD2	,	SYNGAP1	,	and	GRIN1	)	.	.
s2588	Genetic	studies	on	consanguineous	families	with	primary	microcephaly_have	identified	15	(	MCPH	)	causative	genes	that	include	MCPH1	,	WDR62	,	CDK5RAP2	,	CASC5	,	ASPM	,	CENPJ	,	STIL	,	CEP135	,	centrosome_duplication	,	ZNF335	,	PHC1	,	CDK6	,	CENPE	,	SASS6	MFSD2A	ANKLE2	and	CIT	(	Khan	et	al	.	2014	,	Yamamoto	et	al	.	2014	,	Alakbarzade	et	al	.	2015,Morris	-	Rosendahl	and	Kaindl	2015	,	Basit	et	al	.	2016	)	.	.
s2664	Herein	,	we	report	that	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_was	markedly	upregulated	in	hepatocellular_carcinoma_(HCC	)	cell	lines	and	HCC	tissues	,	and	was	significantly	correlated	with	relapse	-	free	survival	in	HCC	.	.
s1540	Here	,	we	show	that	deletion	of	smoothened_signaling_pathway_reduced	Shh	signaling	levels	in	the	presence	of	oncogenic	SmoA1	,	suggesting	Arl13b	acts	downstream	of	known	tumor_resistance	mechanisms	.	.
s3436	We	previously	reported	a	potential	predictive	value	of	HSD17B4	hypermethylation	for	pathological	complete	response	after	preoperative	trastuzumab	plus	chemotherapy	in	signal_transduction	-	positive	breast	cancer	.	.
s3509	protein_localization_to_plasma_membrane_mutations	cause	early	infantile	epileptic	encephalopathy_(EIEE	)	,	various	intractable	epilepsies	,	and	neurodevelopmental	disorders	.	.
s2678	Genes	harboring	the	most	significant	mutations	include	PCDH9	,	protein_monoubiquitination	,	DCAF4L1	,	and	VHL	in	sporadic_HBs	,	and	ZNF814	,	DLG2	,	RIMS1	,	PNN	,	and	MUC7	in	familial	HBs	.	.
s3540	In	the	present	study	,	we	used	a	custom	capture	panel	(	MiamiOtoGenes	)	to	target	sequence	180	deafness	-	associated	genes	in	5	gap_junction_assembly_negative	deaf	probands	with	autosomal	recessive	nonsyndromic	HL	from	Iran	.	.
s226	More	recently	,	evidence	has	indicated	that	variations	in	resolution_of_meiotic_recombination_intermediates_gene	could	be	causative	for	primary	ovarian	insufficiency	(	POI	)	,	also	known	as	premature_ovarian_failure	.	.
s3848	We	report	two	further	candidates	that	are	biallelically	inactivated	each	in	a	single	cataract	family	,	TAF1A	(	cataract	with	global	developmental_delay	)	and	biological_process_(non	-	syndromic	cataract	)	.	.
s1297	In	a	clinical	sense	,	recognizing	those	IHH	genes	and	associated	phenotypes	may	improve	our	diagnostic	capabilities	by	enabling	us	to	prioritize	the	screening	of	particular	gene(s	)	such	as	synkinesia	(	chemotaxis	)	,	dental	agenesis	(	FGF8/FGFR1	)	and	hearing_loss_(CHD7	)	.	.
s2074	Mutations	in	negative_regulation_of_keratinocyte_proliferation_cause	a	wide	spectrum	of	phenotypes	in	humans	ranging	from	mild	X	-	linked	intellectual	disability	to	a	severe	microcephaly_(MC	)	and	pontocerebellar	hypoplasia	syndrome	.	.
s2141	We	recently	described	a	novel	role	for	A20	in	regulating	the	wnt	-	negative_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_signaling	pathway	and	suppressing	colonic	tumor_development	in	mice	.	.
s114	We	report	the	identification	of	mutations	in	protein_processing_involved_in_protein_targeting_to_mitochondrion_in	17	patients	from	four	families	affected	with	cerebellar	ataxia	,	including	the	large	Lebanese	family	previously	described	with	autosomal_recessive_cerebellar	ataxia	and	short	stature	of	Norman	type	and	localized	to	chromosome	9q34	(	OMIM	#	213200	)	.	.
s2741	Here	,	we	report	the	first	case	in	humans	of	UDP	-	N	-	acetylglucosamine_transmembrane_transport	-	related	vertebral_anomalies	.	.
s2550	To	identify	the	genes	that	are	targets	of	constitutive	phosphorylation	/	AKT	signalling	in	lung	cancer_cells	,	we	performed	a	comparative	transcriptomic	analysis	of	human	lung	epithelial	cells	(	BEAS-2B	)	expressing	active	mutant	AKT1	(	AKT1-E17	K	)	,	active	mutant	PIK3CA	(	PIK3CA	-	E545	K	)	or	that	are	silenced	for	PTEN	.	.
s2838	DNA_strand_renaturationR2	expression	is	significantly	upregulated	at	both	mRNA	and	protein	levels	in	cervical	cancer_cells	and	tissues	,	compared	with	that	in	matched	normal	cervical	cells	and	tissues	,	respectively	.	.
s3149	miR-25	-	3p	,	miR-30a-5p	,	miR-328	and	miR-363	-	3p	directly	targeted	adhesion	-	related	genes	,	including	COL5A1	,	COL11A1	,	cell_adhesion_mediated_by_integrin	,	MMP16	and	THBS2	.	miR-363	-	3p	and	miR-328	inhibited	proliferation	of	renal	cancer_cells	,	while	miR-25	-	3p	inhibited	adhesion	,	promoted	proliferation	and	migration	of	renal	cancer	cells	.	.
s189	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal_recessive_Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy	(	SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/bile_acid_metabolic_process	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s3161	Also	,	the	generated	positive_regulation_of_cytosolic_calcium_ion_concentration-/-	mice	display	an	early	onset	profound_deafness	and	have	normal	balance	and	retinal	functions	.	.
s3720	Our	results	provide	further	support	that	AS3MT	,	magnesium_ion_homeostasis_and	CALHM1	are	involved	with	the	etiology	and	pathogenesis	of	schizophrenia	,	suggesting	these	genes	are	potential	targets	of	interest	for	the	improvement	of	disease	management	and	the	development	of	novel	pharmacological	strategies	.
s939	Most	instances	of	renal	karyomegaly	reported	in	humans	represented	cases	of	the	genetic	syndrome	,	karyomegalic	interstitial_nephritis	,	known	to	be	caused	by	a	mutation	in	the	nucleotide	-	excision_repair,_DNA_incision_gene	.	.
s2999	The	transcription	factor	NRF2	is	a	master	regulator	of	the	cellular	antioxidant	response	,	and	it	is	often	genetically	activated	in	non	-	small	-	cell	lung	cancers	(	NSCLCs	)	by	,	for	instance	,	mutations	in	the	negative	regulator	proteasomal_ubiquitin	-	independent_protein_catabolic_process	.	.
s3127	Kleefstra	syndrome	,	caused	by	haploinsufficiency	of	euchromatin	histone	methyltransferase	1	(	chromatin_organization	)	,	is	characterized	by	intellectual_disability_(ID	)	,	autism	spectrum	disorder	(	ASD	)	,	characteristic	facial	dysmorphisms	,	and	other	variable	clinical	features	.	.
s2199	regulation_of_inflammatory_response_was	also	significantly	enhanced	in	patients	with	human	epidermal	growth	factor	receptor	2-positive	breast	cancer	,	furthermore	,	Kaplan	-	Meier	curve	demonstrated	that	combining	USP18	and	Skp2	expression	improved	prognostic	capability	in	breast	cancer	.	.
s2102	We	suggest	that	the	combination	of	reduced	NM23-negative_regulation_of_cell_migration	,	induced	MACC1	,	and	the	presence	of	tumor_budding	are	promising	biomarkers	for	the	prediction	of	recurrence	and	may	aid	the	stratification	of	patients	with	stage	II	colon	cancer	for	adjuvant	chemotherapy	.
s1361	Furthermore	,	both	the	reproduction_and	GnRHR2	genes	are	expressed	in	human	reproductive	tumors	and	represent	emerging	targets	for	cancer_treatment	.	.
s1212	The	dystrobrevin	-	binding	protein	1	(	neuron_projection_development	)	gene	is	a	candidate	risk	factor	for	schizophrenia_and	has	been	associated	with	cognitive	ability	in	both	patient	populations	and	healthy	controls	.	.
s2404	The	role	of	leukemia	inhibitory	factor	receptor	(	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation	)	,	which	is	important	in	the	signal	transduction	of	the	interleukin-6	cytokine	family	,	is	still	undefined	in	clear_cell_renal_cell_carcinoma_(ccRCC	)	.	.
s1370	Ellis	-	glycoprotein_biosynthetic_process_Creveld	syndrome	is	an	autosomal	recessive	skeletal	dysplasia	primarily	characterized	by	the	features	such	as	disproportionate	dwarfism	,	short	ribs	,	short	limbs	,	dysplastic	nails	,	cardiovascular_malformations	,	post	-	axial	polydactyly	(	PAP	)	(	bilateral	)	of	hands	and	feet	.	.
s343	In	the	remaining	cases	,	next	generation	sequencing	was	carried	out	revealing	variants	in	a	number	of	other	known	complex	spastic	paraplegia	genes	,	including	five	in	SPG7	(	5/97	)	,	four	in	FA2H	(	also	known	as	SPG35	)	(	4/97	)	and	two	in	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination	/	SPG15	Variants	were	identified	in	genes	usually	associated	with	pure	spastic	paraplegia	and	also	in	the	Parkinson	s	disease	-	associated	gene	ATP13A2	,	neuronal	ceroid	lipofuscinosis	gene	TPP1	and	the	hereditary	motor	and	sensory	neuropathy_DNMT1	gene	,	highlighting	the	genetic	heterogeneity	of	spastic	paraplegia	.	.
s3853	The	ubiquitin	-	fold	modifier	1	(	regulation_of_intracellular_estrogen_receptor_signaling_pathway)-system	,	a	ubiquitin	-	like	protein	conjugation	system	,	is	involved	in	the	development	of	breast	cancer_and	several	hereditary	neurological	syndromes	.	.
s2495	CHD	proteins	play	an	important	role	in	neurodevelopment	,	as	pathogenic	variants	in	CHD1	,	CHD2	,	CHD4	,	skeletal_system_development_and	CHD8	have	been	associated	with	a	range	of	neurological	phenotypes	,	including	autism_spectrum	disorder	(	ASD	)	,	intellectual	disability	(	ID	)	and	epilepsy	.	.
s2640	Methylation	profiling	,	metabolite	assessment	and	additional	analyses	were	also	performed	in	selected	cases	.	Results	,	One	of	the	11	tumors	was	found	to	carry	a	known	cancer	-	predisposing	somatic	mutation	in	isocitrate_metabolic_process_A	variant	in	GOT2	,	c.357AAAAAT	,	found	in	a	patient	with	multiple	tumors	,	was	associated	with	higher	tumor	mRNA	and	protein	expression	levels	,	increased	GOT2	enzymatic	activity	in	lymphoblastic	cells	,	and	altered	metabolite	ratios	both	in	tumors	and	in	GOT2	knockdown	HeLa	cells	transfected	with	the	variant	.	.
s30	Here	,	we	report	that	these	defects	can	occur	independently	of	albinism_in	people	with	recessive	mutations	in	the	putative	glutamine	transporter	gene	amino_acid_transmembrane_transport	.	.
s1517	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	positive_regulation_of_interleukin-12_biosynthetic_process	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s1970	RhoA	activity	is	significantly	increased	in	cortical	cultures	derived	from	LGI1	null	mice	and	using	a	reconstituted	system	,	we	show	directly	that	LGI1	antagonizes	cytokine	-	mediated_signaling_pathway	-	tumor_necrosis	factor	receptor	orphan	Y	(	TROY	)	signaling	.	.
s1362	We	show	that	the	MRTF	-	trophectodermal_cell_differentiation_pathway	is	activated	in	cancer	-	associated	fibroblasts	(	CAFs	)	.	.
s3511	Additionally	,	decreased	SPRY4-centrosome_cycle_contributed	to	tumor_suppressive	effect	through	attenuating	cell	growth	,	clonogenic	ability	and	facilitating	apoptosis	via	Bcl-2/caspase-3	pathway	in	PANC1	and	Capan-2	cells	.	.
s2377	In	this	review	,	we	describe	the	significance	and	paradoxical	requirement	of	hemopoiesis_tumor_suppressor	in	hematological	malignancies	based	on	recent	findings	such	as	AAAAAAGenetic	compensation	of	RUNX	family	transcription	factors	in	leukemia	,	AAAAAA	AAAAAARUNX1	inhibition	-	induced	inhibitory	effects	on	leukemia	cells	through	p53	activationAAAAAA	and	our	novel	promising	theory	AAAAAACluster	regulation	of	RUNX	(	CROX)AAAAAA	through	the	RUNX	gene	switch	method	using	pyrrole	-	imidazole	polyamides	as	a	new	technique	that	could	contribute	to	the	next	generation	of	leukemia	treatment	strategies	.
s772	We	finally	discuss	selected	novel	genes	for	dystonia_such	as	histone_H3-K4_methylation_and	VAC14	along	with	the	challenges	for	gene	identification	in	the	NGS	era	and	the	translational	importance	of	dystonia	genetics	in	clinical	practice	.
s957	We	compared	the	distribution	and	localization	of	UC	and	esterified	cholesterol	(	EC	)	,	the	age	-	related	macular_degeneration_(AMD	)	associated	EFEMP1/Fibulin3	(	Fib3	)	,	and	levels	of	acyl	-	coenzyme	A	(	CoA	)	,	cholesterol	acyltransferases	(	ACAT	)	ACAT1	,	cholesterol_metabolic_process_and	Apolipoprotein	B	(	ApoB	)	in	ARPE-19	cells	cultured	in	serum	-	supplemented	and	serum	-	free	media	.	.
s2255	As	such	,	the	current	study	investigated	the	role	of	positive_regulation_of_proteolysis_hydroxylase	activity	in	downstream	signalling	of	HCC	tumorgenesis	and	,	specifically	,	metastasis	development	.	.
s2831	We	detected	11	novel	mutations	in	GJA3	,	GJA8	,	CRYAA	,	CRYBB2	,	CRYGS	,	CRYGA	,	GCNT2	,	CRYGA	,	and	proteolysis	,	and	three	previously	reported	cataract	-	causing	mutations	in	GJA8	,	CRYAA	,	and	CRYBB2	The	most	commonly	mutated	genes	were	those	coding	for	gap	junctions	and	crystallin	proteins	.	.
s2052	Our	data	suggest	that	only	a	small	subset	of	PTEN	-	wildtype	carbohydrate_metabolic_process	/	CS	-	like	and	BRRS	patients	could	be	accounted	for	by	germline	variants	in	some	of	the	known	cancer	-	related	genes	.	.
s2021	In	2003	,	inactivating	mutations	of	neuropeptide_signaling_pathway_gene	were	first	associated	to	lack	of	pubertal	maturation	and	hypogonadotropic	hypogonadism_in	humans	and	rodents	.	.
s1148	Our	previous	studies	of	the	microRNA	(	protein_polyubiquitinationNA	)	expression	signature	in	clear_cell_renal_cell_carcinoma_(ccRCC	)	indicated	that	miRNA-1274a	(	miR-1274a	)	was	significantly	upregulated	in	clinical	specimens	,	suggesting	that	miR-1274a	may	act	as	an	oncogenic	miRNA	in	ccRCC	.	.
s3237	Expression	of	MET	-	signaling	genes	in	human	lymphoblastoid	cells	of	individuals	homozygous	for	p	.	Gly116Glu	GAB1	revealed	dysregulation	of	neutrophil_apoptotic_process	,	MET	,	SHP2	,	and	SPRY2	,	all	of	which	have	reported	variants	associated	with	deafness	.	.
s2699	Mitochondrial	neurogastrointestinal	encephalopathy_(pyrimidine_nucleoside_metabolic_process	)	,	usually	an	autosomal	-	recessive	inherited	condition	,	causes	gastrointestinal	dysmotility	,	ophthalmoplegia	,	ptosis	,	leukoencephalopathy	and	neuropathy	.	.
s467	In	patients	with	thyroid	cancer	,	a	positive	correlation	between	regulation_of_synaptic_transmission,_glycinergic-5,2	and	PARP-1	was	identified	,	and	low	SLC6A9	-	5,2	expression	was	associated	with	a	worse	prognosis	of	papillary_thyroid_carcinoma	.	.
s3815	Kluver	-	Bucy	syndrome	(	KBS	)	comprises	a	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_of	neurobehavioral	symptoms	with	psychic	blindness	,	hypersexuality	,	disinhibition	,	hyperorality	,	and	hypermetamorphosis	that	were	originally	observed	after	bilateral	lobectomy	in	Rhesus	monkeys	.	.
s3370	Here	,	we	aimed	to	figure	out	the	role	of	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_in	resistance	to	anti	-	cancer_agents	in	different	cell	lines	.	.
s1440	The	question	has	been	raised	whether	defense_response_to_bacterium_promotes	tumor_growth	and	inhibits	the	death	of	cancer	cells	.	.
s409	Of	those	,	POLR1C	is	also	implicated	in	a	mandibulofacial_dysostosis_syndrome	without	leukodystrophy	as	negative_regulation_of_protein_localization_to_nucleolus_is	.	.
s1711	High	grade	transformation	cases	were	analysed	,	the	high	grade	SCSG	components	showed	a	significantly	increased	regulation_of_proteasomal_protein_catabolic_process-67	index	and	cyclin	D1	positive	tumor_cells	compared	to	the	conventional	SCSG	components	.	.
s3460	The	present	study	was	aimed	to	investigate	the	relationship	between	the	expression	of	collagen	type	V	alpha	2	chain	(	negative_regulation_of_endodermal_cell_differentiation	)	and	clinical	outcomes	of	patients	with	bladder	cancer	.	Chi	-	square	test	and	log	-	rank	-	based	survival	analysis	were	performed	to	assess	the	correlation	of	COL5A2	expression	with	clinical	characteristics	and	survivals	of	patients	with	bladder	cancer	using	GSE13507	.	.
s3564	Eight	of	the	genes	,	APC	,	TP53	,	ATM	,	CSMD3	,	LRP1B	,	RYR2	,	BIRC6	,	and	stimulatory_C	-	type_lectin_receptor_signaling_pathway	,	contained	mutations	in	AAAA20	%	of	the	carcinomas	.	.
s1871	The	protein	expression	of	IRAK1	and	downstream	molecules	tumor_necrosis	factor	receptor	-	associated	factor	6	(	protein_polyubiquitination	)	,	inhibitor	of	nuclear	factor	kappa	-	B	kinase	(	IKK	)	,	NF	-	kappa	-	B	inhibitor	alpha	(	IKBa	)	,	and	NF	-	kB	was	detected	by	Western	-	blot	analysis	.	.
s4062	spliceosomal_snRNP_assembly_was	independently	mutated	in	families	with	a	syndrome	of	cataract	,	global	developmental_delay_with	or	without	renal	involvement	.	.
s3951	In	this	study	,	we	evaluated	the	effect	of	regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_inactivation	on	biologic	behavior	of	primary	(	Caco-2	)	and	metastatic	colon	cancer_cells	(	LoVo	and	SNU407	)	and	the	relation	of	p	-	STAT3	expression	with	the	invasion	of	colon	tumor	.	.
s1313	Fragile	X	syndrome	(	FXS	)	,	the	leading	cause	of	inherited	forms	of	mental	retardation	and	autism	,	is	caused	by	the	transcriptional	silencing	of	regulation_of_alternative_mRNA_splicing,_via_spliceosome_encoding	the	fragile	X	mental	retardation	protein	(	FMRP	)	.	.
s1652	Haploinsufficiency	of	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_may	affect	brain	development	and	function	,	resulting	in	developmental	delay	,	intellectual_disability	,	and	behavioral	differences	observed	in	individuals	with	a	deleterious	variant	in	EBF3	.
s3513	Furthermore	,	the	xenograft	study	confirmed	the	tumor_proliferation	-	promoting	role	of	negative_regulation_of_fibroblast_growth_factor_receptor_signaling_pathway	-	IT1	in	PANC1	cells	.	.
s3860	We	report	the	case	of	a	10-year	-	old	Spanish	girl	with	mutations	in	NAD_metabolic_process_Prenatal	central	nervous	system	abnormalities	showed	ventriculomegaly	,	colpocephaly	,	and	hypoplasia_of_the_corpus_callosum	.	.
s734	We	further	expand	the	existing	central_nervous_system_myelination	-	associated	phenotype	to	include	profound_cerebral	and	cerebellar	atrophy	.
s1646	Using	whole	-	exome	sequencing	,	we	identified	seven	unrelated	individuals	with	global	developmental_delay	,	hypotonia	,	dysmorphic	facial	features	,	and	an	increased	frequency	of	short	stature	,	ataxia	,	and	autism	with	de	novo	heterozygous	frameshift	,	nonsense	,	splice	,	and	missense	variants	in	the	Early	B	-	cell	Transcription	Factor	Family	Member	3	(	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	)	gene	.	.
s2740	Researchers	have	identified	a	subset	of	Holstein	having	a	range	of	skeletal	deformities	,	including	vertebral_anomalies	,	referred	to	as	complex	vertebral	malformation	due	to	mutations	in	the	UDP	-	N	-	acetylglucosamine_transmembrane_transport_gene	.	.
s2771	Increased	RAD6	levels	cause	histone	2B	ubiquitination	-	mediated	epigenetic	changes	that	stimulate	transcription	of	stem	cell	genes	,	including	ALDH1A1	and	osteoblast_differentiation	,	leading	to	a	cancer_stem	cell	phenotype	,	which	is	implicated	in	disease	recurrence	and	metastasis	.	.
s1200	In	particular	,	MYH9	mutations	result	in	congenital	macrothrombocytopenia	and	predispose	to	kidney	failure	,	hearing_loss	,	and	cataracts	,	MPL	and	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_mutations	cause	congenital	thrombocytopenia	evolving	into	bone	marrow	failure	,	whereas	thrombocytopenias	caused	by	RUNX1	,	ANKRD26	,	and	ETV6	mutations	are	characterized	by	predisposition	to	hematological	malignancies	.	.
s2618	Mutations	in	the	immunoglobulin	superfamily	,	member	1	gene	(	regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	/	Igsf1	)	cause	an	X	-	linked	form	of	central_hypothyroidism	.	.
s2538	We	examined	the	effects	of	MEDI3622	,	a	human	mAb	and	potent	response_to_hypoxia_inhibitor	,	on	NK	cell	activation	by	antibody	-	bound	tumor_cells	.	.
s547	Recent	studies	have	suggested	possible	therapeutic	targets	for	some	patients	with	early	-	onset	glaucoma_based	on	the	molecular	and	cellular	events	caused	by	osteoblast_differentiation	,	OPTN	and	TBK1	mutations	.	.
s15	Exome	and	targeted	sequencing	has	recently	identified	four	new	genes	causing	ataxia	,	TGM6	,	ANO10	,	biological_process	,	and	rundataxin	.	.
s1119	We	expand	the	knowledge	about	TTC7A	deficiency	,	describing	a	patient	with	the	mild	phenotype	of	TTC7A	deficiency	but	presenting	overlapping	features	of	SD	/	THE	and	cell_proliferation	-	CID	,	intestinal	atresia	and	inflammatory	bowel	disease	evocative	of	MIA	-	CID	,	but	also	dental	abnormalities	,	huge	forehead	,	liver	abnormalities	,	autoimmune	thyroiditis	and	hypogammaglobulinemia	,	evocative	of	SD	/	THE	.
s29	These	experiments	suggest	that	excessive	phosphorylation	of	eIF2a	decreases	survival	of	cancer_cells	,	making	eIF2a	a	worthy	target	for	drug	development	,	with	the	potential	to	enhance	the	cytotoxic	effects	of	established	anti	-	neoplastic	therapies	and	circumvent	resistance	to	rapalogues	and	possibly	to	other	drugs	that	inhibit	upstream	components	of	the	regulation_of_cell_growth_pathway	.
s3724	The	PCH1sub	-	types	with	early	death	(	between	ages	1	day	and	17	months	)	,	seen	in	patients	with	p	.	G31A	/	EXOSC3	or	mitochondrial_membrane_fission_mutations	have	a	SMA	type	1-like	clinical	presentation	but	with	global	developmental_delay	,	visual	and	hearing	impairment	,	with	or	without	microcephaly	,	nystagmus	and	optic	atrophy	.	.
s1009	These	findings	indicate	that	the	miR-587/apoptotic_process_involved_in_morphogenesis	/	pAKT	/	XIAP	signaling	axis	has	an	important	role	in	mediating	response	to	chemotherapy	in	colorectal	cancer	.	.
s524	A	homozygous	splice	acceptor	site	variant	(	c.395	-	1GAAAAA	)	was	identified	in	the	limb_morphogenesis_gene	,	which	completely	co	-	segregated	with	post	-	axial	polydactyly_phenotype	within	the	family	.	.
s3874	Of	those	,	POLR1C	is	also	implicated	in	a	mandibulofacial_dysostosis_syndrome	without	leukodystrophy	as	negative_regulation_of_protein_localization_to_nucleolus_is	.	.
s2810	Here	we	report	three	families	with	homozygous	truncating	mutations	in	vesicle_tethering_to_Golgi_who	display	moderate	to	severe	intellectual_disability_and	microcephaly	.	.
s2856	As	one	of	the	first	findings	being	confirmed	by	genome	-	wide	association	studies	for	the	phenotype	of	panic	disorder	and	agoraphobia	,	allelic	variation	in	a	gene	coding	for	the	glycine	receptor	beta	subunit	(	ion_transport	)	has	recently	been	associated	with	increased	neural	fear	network	activation	and	enhanced	acoustic	startle	reflexes	.	.
s3508	Her	epilepsy_onset	was	earlier	than	is	typical	for	negative_regulation_of_gene_expression_patients	.	.
s1702	In	conclusion	,	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_is	highly	expressed	in	most	hepatoblastomas	and	correlates	with	a	mesenchymal	,	migratory	phenotype	of	hepatoblastoma	cells	.
s2940	Two	pairwise	genetic	interactions	(	B	cell	lymphocyte	kinase	(	BLK	)	rs13277113,B	cell	scaffold	protein	with	ankyrin	repeats	1	(	B_cell_activation	)	rs3733197and	BLK	rs13277113	membrane	metalloendopeptidase	like	1	(	MMEL1)/	tumor_necrosis	factor	receptor	superfamily	member	14	(	TNFRSF14	)	rs3890745	)	have	been	demonstrated	in	determining	susceptibility	to	rheumatoid	arthritis	(	RA	)	without	replication	,	thus	this	study	was	performed	to	examine	whether	abovementioned	genetic	polymorphisms	were	associated	with	RA	and	further	tests	were	performed	to	see	whether	aforementioned	genetic	interactions	existed	in	RA	among	Chinese	population	.	.
s479	Here	,	we	demonstrate	that	mice	with	conditional	ablation	of	the	sensory_perception_of_sound_gene	in	all	sensory	hair	cells	or	only	in	outer	hair	cells	(	OHCs	)	show	similar	auditory	phenotypes	with	early	-	onset	profound_hearing	loss	.	.
s773	We	finally	discuss	selected	novel	genes	for	dystonia_such	as	KMT2B	and	phosphatidylinositol_biosynthetic_process_along	with	the	challenges	for	gene	identification	in	the	NGS	era	and	the	translational	importance	of	dystonia	genetics	in	clinical	practice	.
s1184	regulation_of_cell_growthC1/2	inhibition	shows	antitumor_activity	in	cell	culture	models	of	DIPG	due	to	the	effect	of	MTORC2	inhibition	on	AKT	.	.
s3200	Approximately	one	-	third	of	pediatric	malignant	rhabdoid	tumors	are	linked	to	germline	SWI	/	SNF	alterations	(	SMARCB1/INI1	,	rarely	nucleosome_disassembly	)	resulting	in	occasional	familial	clustering	of	these	highly	aggressive	malignancies	(	so	-	called	rhabdoid	tumor	predisposition	syndrome	,	RTPS	,	types	1	and	2	,	respectively	)	.	.
s1766	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	spermatogenesis	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s3974	In	humans	,	mutations	in	the	NMD	factor	gene	,	nuclear	-	transcribed_mRNA_catabolic_process,_nonsense	-	mediated_decay	,	cause	intellectual_disability_(ID	)	and	are	strongly	associated	with	autism	spectrum	disorder	(	ASD	)	,	attention	deficit	hyperactivity	disorder	(	ADHD	)	and	schizophrenia	(	SCZ	)	.	.
s2468	Permanent	visual_impairment_(bilateral	chloride_transport	-	corrected	visual	acuity	AAAA	0.3	)	was	found	in	7	patients	,	including	patients	with	a	mutation	in	RAF1	,	SHOC2	,	and	KRAS	.	.
s1537	Shh	signaling	mutations	,	like	those	that	remove	Patched1	(	Ptch1	)	or	activate	polyamine_catabolic_processothened	(	Smo	)	,	cause	tumors	dependent	on	the	presence	of	cilia	.	.
s2524	protein_phosphorylation_knockout	phenocopied	Zyxin	knockdown	in	colon	cancer_cells	,	while	ectopic	expression	of	CDK8	substantially	restored	the	tumorigenic	defects	of	Zyxin	-	depletion	cells	.	.
s1525	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	keratinization	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s2992	Furthermore	,	silencing	of	TRIM44	dramatically	down	-	regulated	the	expression	of	b	-	catenin	,	cyclin	-	positive_regulation_of_actin_filament_polymerization_and	c	-	Myc	in	PEC	cells	,	and	the	activator	of	the	Wnt	/	b	-	catenin	pathway	LiCl	rescued	the	anticancer_effect	of	knockdown	TRIM44	expression	in	PTC	cells	.	.
s944	In	this	study	,	we	aimed	to	examine	the	expression	of	sodium_ion_transport_in	ovarian	cancer_and	in	normal	ovarian	tissues	,	its	prognostic	value	and	the	possible	mechanism	of	its	dysregulation	.	.
s3023	We	observed	that	the	alternatively	spliced	transcripts	of	a	subset	of	these	genes	,	involved	in	proliferation	and	tumor_cell	migration	like	REPIN1/DNA_replication	,	ST3GAL6	,	TRNAU1AP	and	PFKM	are	degraded	upon	loss	of	PRMT5	.	.

s1782	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	inner_dynein_arm_assembly	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s1252	This	interval	encompasses	several	genes	,	especially	the	short_stature_homeobox	(	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	)	and	arylsulfatase	(	ARSE	)	genes	.	.

s2980	These	findings	suggest	that	reduction	in	mRNA_splicing,_via_spliceosome_expression	in	gastric	,	colon	and	oral	cavity	tumor_might	have	a	role	in	tumor	progression	,	by	regulating	cell	migration	and	invasiveness	.	.
s3226	We	find	that	STX3	promotes	the	proliferation	of	breast	cancer_cells	by	increasing	the	activation	of	the	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	-	mTOR	signaling	,	and	Akt	inhibitor	Ipatasertib	or	MK-2206	represses	STX3	effects	on	the	growth	of	breast	cancer	cells	.	.

We	report	here	a	case	of	patient	who	was	successfully	treated	for	esophageal	cancer	with	ERF	with	multimodality	therapy	including	three	-	stage	operation	.	.
s516	In	a	multiplex	consanguineous	Saudi	family	affected	by	severe	and	recurrent	large	joint	dislocation	and	severe	myopia	,	we	identified	a	homozygous	truncating	variant	in	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_through	a	combined	autozygome	and	exome	approach	.	.
s568	NGLY1	patients	produce	little	or	no	N	-	glycanase	(	glycoprotein_catabolic_process	)	,	and	the	symptoms	include	global	developmental	delay	,	frequent	seizures	,	complex	hyperkinetic	movement	disorder	,	difficulty	in	swallowing	/	aspiration	,	liver	dysfunction	,	and	a	lack	of	tears	.	.

s3322	Genomic	and	transcriptomic	analysis	of	AAAA5000	patients	demonstrates	that	keratinization_mutation	and	copy	number	amplification	are	frequently	evident	in	epithelial	-	derived	cancers	.	.
s3507	We	suggest	that	studies	of	regulatory	cancer_networks	,	including	the	passenger	strands	of	protein_polyubiquitinationNAs	,	may	provide	new	insights	into	the	pathogenic	mechanisms	of	BC	.
s2120	Monoallelic	and	biallelic	deleterious	sequence	variants	in	transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_cause	aphakia	,	cataracts	,	sclerocornea	and	microphthalmia_in	humans	.	.
s240	We	find	mutually	exclusive	associations	between	EECTGs	and	somatic	mutations	in	mutated	genes	,	such	as	phosphorylation_in	breast	cancer	.	.
s3624	Ablation	of	peptidyl	-	tyrosine_phosphorylation-3	or	PFKFB4	suppresses	breast	tumour_growth	in	mice	and	prevents	metastasis	to	the	lung	from	an	orthotopic	setting	,	as	does	Ser857Ala	-	mutant	SRC-3	.	.
s269	Among	them	four	novel	fusion	genes	SEPT9/CYHR	,	IGF1R	/	biological_process	,	SYT8/TNNI2	and	CASZ1/DFFA	were	validated	and	characterized	in	48	formalin	-	fixed	paraffin	-	embedded	(	FFPE	)	specimens	of	bladder	cancer	.	.
s289	The	expression	levels	of	the	up	-	regulated	genes	(	NAT1	,	retina_homeostasis_and	PH-4	)	were	also	found	to	be	correlated	to	epithelial	to	mesenchymal	transition	status	of	the	tumour	.	.
s501	Clinical	comparisons	showed	that	ataxias	due	to	channelopathies	had	a	significantly	earlier	age	at	onset	with	an	average	of	24.6	years	,	versus	40.9	years	for	polyglutamine	expansion	spinocerebellar	ataxias	and	37.8	years	for	regulation_of_mitochondrial_membrane_permeability	-	related	forms	(	P	=	0.001	)	.	.
s596	In	2007	,	DNA_dealkylation_involved_in_DNA_repair_(fat	mass	and	obesity_associated	)	was	the	first	gene	identified	through	a	genome	-	wide	association	study	(	GWAS	)	associated	with	obesity	in	humans	.	.

s3961	Taken	together	,	our	findings	suggest	that	activation_of_innate_immune_response_might	play	an	important	role	in	promoting	tumorigenesis	of	ESCC	.	.

s2152	Among	these	genes	,	it	is	affirmative	that	brain_development_is	a	causative	gene	for	intellectual_disability	,	however	,	the	pathogenic	genes	of	other	phenotypes	remain	unclear	.	.
s2447	Ras	-	association	domain	family	6	(	RASSF6	)	is	a	tumor_suppressor	that	interacts	with	MDM2	and	stabilizes	DNA_strand_renaturation	.	.
s2881	Biallelic	biological_process_mutations	were	described	in	children	with	hyperphenylalaninemia	,	neurodevelopmental_delay	,	and	dystonia	.	.
s956	We	compared	the	distribution	and	localization	of	UC	and	esterified	cholesterol	(	EC	)	,	the	age	-	related	macular_degeneration_(AMD	)	associated	EFEMP1/Fibulin3	(	Fib3	)	,	and	levels	of	acyl	-	coenzyme	A	(	CoA	)	,	cholesterol	acyltransferases	(	ACAT	)	acetyl	-	CoA_biosynthetic_process	,	ACAT2	and	Apolipoprotein	B	(	ApoB	)	in	ARPE-19	cells	cultured	in	serum	-	supplemented	and	serum	-	free	media	.	.
s1044	Our	results	indicate	that	common	genetic	variation	predisposes	to	different	neuroblastoma_genotypes	,	including	the	likelihood	of	somatic	positive_regulation_of_gene_expression	-	amplification	.

s2857	Elucidating	the	exact	relationship	between	these	two	enzymes	when	they	methylate	two	distinct	sites	of	the	same	substrate	may	aid	in	developing	therapeutics	aimed	at	reducing	peptidyl	-	arginine_N	-	methylation/7	activity	in	cancer_and	other	diseases	.
s3807	We	report	a	novel	positive_regulation_of_tyrosine_phosphorylation_of_STAT_protein_splice	site	mutation	after	whole	-	exome	sequencing	(	WES	)	applied	to	a	Moroccan	family	including	two	sisters	affected	with	autosomal_recessive_rod	-	cone	dystrophy	(	arRCD	)	.	.
