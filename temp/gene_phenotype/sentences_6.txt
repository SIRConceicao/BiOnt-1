s3109	For	the	site	-	specific	delivery	of	the	anticancer_drug	into	TNBC	,	anti	-	negative_regulation_of_epithelial_cell_migration_antibody	-	conjugated	nanoparticles	(	ST	-	NPs	)	were	prepared	as	the	potential	nanocarrier	,	composed	of	carboxymethyl	dextran	(	CMD	)	derivatives	with	bioreducible	disulfide	bonds	.	.
s2193	Furthermore	,	the	Gene	Set	Enrichment	Analysis	results	demonstrated	that	regulation_of_inflammatory_response_may	be	negatively	associated	with	apoptosis	in	patients	with	breast	cancer	.	.
s3372	Our	patient	had	all	the	major	characteristic	features	consistent	with	Ellis	-	glycoprotein_biosynthetic_process_Creveld	syndrome	including	post	-	axial_polydactyly	,	teeth	and	nail	abnormalities	,	congenital	heart	defect	and	skeletal	dysplasia	.	.
s342	In	the	remaining	cases	,	next	generation	sequencing	was	carried	out	revealing	variants	in	a	number	of	other	known	complex	spastic_paraplegia_genes	,	including	five	in	SPG7	(	5/97	)	,	four	in	FA2H	(	also	known	as	SPG35	)	(	4/97	)	and	two	in	ZFYVE26/SPG15	Variants	were	identified	in	genes	usually	associated	with	pure	spastic	paraplegia	and	also	in	the	Parkinson	s	disease	-	associated	gene	ATP13A2	,	neuronal	ceroid	lipofuscinosis	gene	TPP1	and	the	hereditary	motor	and	sensory	neuropathy	maintenance_of_DNA_methylation_gene	,	highlighting	the	genetic	heterogeneity	of	spastic	paraplegia	.	.

s94	A	bioinformatic	analysis	of	protein_polyubiquitinationNA	array	and	metabolite	-	profiling	data	from	NCI-60	cancer_cell	panel	revealed	thiamine	as	a	metabolite	positively	correlated	with	the	miR-155	expression	level	.	.
s3478	The	present	study	demonstrated	that	definitive_hemopoiesis_was	up	-	regulated	in	breast	cancers	compared	with	that	in	normal	breast	tissues	,	and	further	increased	in	breast	cancer	bone	metastasis	.	.
s3235	Expression	of	MET	-	signaling	genes	in	human	lymphoblastoid	cells	of	individuals	homozygous	for	p	.	Gly116Glu	GPI_anchor_biosynthetic_process_revealed	dysregulation	of	HGF	,	MET	,	SHP2	,	and	SPRY2	,	all	of	which	have	reported	variants	associated	with	deafness	.	.
s3362	Spinocerebellar	ataxia_type	3	(	SCA3	)	is	a	neurodegenerative	disorder	caused	by	a	CAG	expansion	in	the	protein_K63-linked_deubiquitination_gene	leading	to	a	polyglutamine	expansion	in	the	ataxin-3	protein	.	.
s2384	hyaluronan_catabolic_process_was	expressed	on	the	surface	of	poorly	differentiated	tumour_cells	,	and	within	the	The	Cancer	Genome	Atlas	-	Head	and	Neck	Squamous	Cell	Carcinoma	samples	,	its	messenger	RNA	levels	were	higher	in	tumours	compared	to	normal	.	.
s1168	Results	,	We	identified	one	independent	SNP	,	rs2394882	,	in	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_that	was	associated	with	prostate	cancer_recurrence	(	hazard	ratio	0.32	,	95	%	confidence	interval	0.14	-	0.71	,	P	=	0.005	)	after	adjustment	for	known	clinical	predictors	.	.
s1963	It	was	our	aim	to	investigate	behavioral	and	obesity_effects	evoked	by	treatment	with	probiotics	via	neuroinflammatory	factors	and	namely	IL-1b	,	NLRP3	,	Caspase-1	and	peripheral_nervous_system_development	-	kB	levels	in	the	Syrian	golden	hamster	.	.
s232	Somatic	mutations	in	four	genes	(	potassium_ion_import_across_plasma_membrane	,	ATP1A1	,	ATP2B3	and	CACNA1D	)	,	differently	implicated	in	intracellular	ion	homeostasis	,	have	been	identified	in	nearly	60	%	of	the	sporadic_APAs	.	.
s3902	Furthermore	,	using	in	silico	pathogenicity	prediction	of	missense	variants	among	18	genes	associated	with	breast	/	ovarian	cancer_and	/	or	Lynch	syndrome	,	followed	by	KASP	genotyping	in	710	healthy	controls	,	we	identified	AAAAAAlikely	pathogenicAAAAAA	missense	variants	in	protein_phosphorylation	,	BRIP1	,	CHEK2	and	TP53	.	.
s1187	Another	polymorphism	in	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	-	RASA2	has	been	observed	to	be	associated	with	the	susceptibility	of	sporadic_Creutzfeldt	-	Jacob	disease	(	sCJD	)	in	UK	.	.
s1928	Although	cellular_amino_acid_metabolic_process_FKO	mice	had	no	apparent	defects	in	adipose	tissue	development	,	these	mice	ameliorated	glucose	intolerance	upon	diet	-	induced	obesity	.	.
s2628	Reporting	in	this	issue	of	Developmental	Cell	,	Kanie	et	al	.	(	2017	)	shed	light	on	the	mechanism	of	transport	by	implicating	microtubule_anchoring_at_centrosome	,	which	is	associated	with	an	autosomal	-	recessive	obesity_syndrome	when	mutated	,	in	the	triggering	of	intraflagellar	transport	.
s3059	By	targeted	sequencing	,	we	identified	novel	adenosine_to_inosine_editing_and	RNASEH2B	variants	,	and	a	3-	to	17-fold	frequency	increase	of	the	AGS	mutations	ADAR	,	c.577CAAAAG	,	p.(P193A	)	and	RNASEH2B	,	c.529GAAAAA	,	p.(A177	T	)	in	the	germline	of	familial	glioma_patients	as	well	as	in	test	and	validation	cohorts	of	glioblastomas	and	prostate	carcinomas	versus	ethnicity	-	matched	controls	,	whereby	rare	RNASEH2B	variants	were	significantly	more	frequent	in	familial	glioma	patients	.	.
s3899	We	found	monoallelic	truncating	/	functionally	deleterious	mutations	in	seven	genes	,	including	ATM	and	CHEK2	,	which	have	previously	been	associated	with	PrCa	predisposition	,	and	five	new	candidate	PrCa	associated	genes	involved	in	cancer_predisposing	recessive	disorders	,	namely	RAD51C	,	FANCD2	,	positive_regulation_of_protein_ubiquitination	,	CEP57	and	RECQL4	.	.
s3903	Furthermore	,	using	in	silico	pathogenicity	prediction	of	missense	variants	among	18	genes	associated	with	breast	/	ovarian	cancer_and	/	or	Lynch	syndrome	,	followed	by	KASP	genotyping	in	710	healthy	controls	,	we	identified	AAAAAAlikely	pathogenicAAAAAA	missense	variants	in	ATM	,	BRIP1	,	regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_and	TP53	.	.
s2849	Herein	,	we	describe	the	clinical	and	genetic	characterization	of	79	patients	with	inherited	thiamine	defects	causing	encephalopathy_in	childhood	,	identifying	outcome	predictors	in	patients	with	pathogenic	thiamine_transmembrane_transport_variants	,	the	most	common	genetic	etiology	.	.
s3714	Preoperative	lymph	node	(	melanosome_transport	)	status	is	important	for	the	treatment	of	bladder	cancer_(BCa	)	.	.
s3688	Pathogenic	variants	in	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_were	recently	described	in	three	back	-	to	-	back	publications	in	association	with	a	novel	neurodevelopmental	disorder	characterized	by	intellectual	disability	,	speech	delay	,	ataxia	,	and	facial	dysmorphisms	.	.
s297	Bardet	Biedl	syndrome	(	visual_perception	)	is	a	multisystem	genetically	heterogeneous	ciliopathy	that	most	commonly	leads	to	obesity	,	photoreceptor	degeneration	,	digit	anomalies	,	genito	-	urinary	abnormalities	,	as	well	as	cognitive	impairment	with	autism	,	among	other	features	.	.
s3115	Breakthrough	discoveries	include	the	role	of	somatic	variants	in	the	KCNJ5	,	CACNA1D	,	cellular_sodium_ion_homeostasis	,	and	ATP2B3	genes	as	causes	of	aldosterone	-	producing	adenomas	(	APAs	)	,	and	the	recognition	of	three	novel	hyperaldosteronism_syndromes	with	germline	variants	in	the	KCNJ5	,	CACNA1D	,	and	CACNA1H	genes	.	.
s4008	Complex	recessive	spastic_paraplegias	have	in	the	past	been	frequently	associated	with	mutations	in	chemical_synaptic_transmission_(spatacsin	)	,	ZFYVE26/SPG15	,	SPG7	(	paraplegin	)	and	a	handful	of	other	rare	genes	,	but	many	cases	remain	genetically	undefined	.	.
s1075	Five	of	the	PHPT	syndromes	reflect	overgrowth	of	parathyroid	tissue	,	in	contrast	,	familial	hypocalciuric	hypercalcemia_reflects	dysregulation	of	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_secretion	with	little	or	no	parathyroid	overgrowth	.	.
s1438	However	,	clinical	and	preclinical	studies	have	prompted	concerns	that	defense_response_to_bacterium_and	the	presence	of	its	receptor	,	EpoR	,	in	tumor_cells	may	be	responsible	for	adverse	effects	and	,	eventually	,	death	.	.
s3521	Kleefstra	syndrome	,	a	disease	with	intellectual_disability	,	autism	spectrum	disorders	and	other	developmental	defects	is	caused	in	humans	by	haploinsufficiency	of	chromatin_organization	.	.
s507	blood_coagulation	-	associated	severe	congenital	neutropenia_(SCN	)	is	a	rare	disorder	characterized	by	life	-	threating	infections	,	neutropenia	,	neutrophil	and	platelet	dysfunction	,	poor	response	to	filgrastim	,	and	myelofibrosis	with	extramedullary	hematopoiesis	.	.
s558	Recent	GWAS	completed	for	three	types	of	common	adult	-	onset	glaucoma_have	identified	novel	loci	for	POAG	(	primary	-	open	-	angle	glaucoma	)	(	ABCA1	,	AFAP1	,	GMDS	,	PMM2	,	TGFBR3	,	FNDC3B	,	ARHGEF12	,	GAS7	,	FOXC1	,	ATXN2	,	cell_redox_homeostasis	)	,	PACG	(	primary	angle	-	closure	glaucoma	(	EPDR1	,	CHAT	,	GLIS3	,	FERMT2	,	DPM2-FAM102	)	,	and	exfoliation	syndrome	(	XFS	)	glaucoma	(	CACNA1A	)	.	.
s4020	Whole	-	exome	sequencing	analysis	identified	a	novel	homozygous	c.100	G	AAAA	A	change	in	intraciliary_retrograde_transport_segregating	with	retinal_degeneration_and	not	present	in	ethnicity	-	matched	controls	.	.
s3378	This	indicates	that	dopamine	-	mediated	synaptic	remodeling	and	plasticity	is	independent	of	dopamine	innervation	during	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_development	and	that	Pitx3-/-	mice	are	a	good	model	because	they	develop	the	same	pathology	described	in	the	toxins	-	based	models	and	in	human	postmortem	studies	of	advanced	PD.SIGNIFICANCE	STATEMENT	As	the	only	genetic	model	of	Parkinson	s	disease	(	PD	)	that	develops	dyskinesia	,	Pitx3-/-	mice	reproduce	the	behavioral	effects	seen	in	humans	and	are	a	good	system	for	studying	dopamine	-	induced	synaptic	remodeling	.	.
s659	Our	data	,	therefore	,	highlight	heterotypic_cell	-	cell_adhesion_as	a	glioblastoma_biomarker	and	candidate	therapeutic	target	.
s2537	Before	and	after	eight	weeks	daily	treatment	with	six	capsules	of	FAAAAAamp	,	V	juice	concentrate	or	placebo	,	peripheral	blood	gene	expression	(	microarray	,	quantitative	polymerase	chain	reaction	(	qPCR	)	)	,	plasma	tumour_necrosis	factor	(	protein_import_into_nucleus,_translocation)a	(	enzyme	-	linked	immunosorbent	assay	(	ELISA	)	)	,	body	composition	(	Dual	-	energy	X	-	ray	absorptiometry	(	DEXA	)	)	and	lipid	profiles	were	assessed	.	.
s801	PTEN	,	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_and	PIK3R1	were	the	most	frequently	mutated	canonical	cancer	-	related	genes	.	.
s2295	Inactivation	of	signal_transduction_in	mice	compromised	the	cold	-	induced	thermogenic	response	selectively	in	subcutaneous	fat	and	exacerbated	high	-	fat	diet	-	induced	obesity_and	associated	metabolic	disorders	,	indicating	that	even	partial	loss	of	beige	fat	regulation	in	vivo	had	detrimental	consequences	.	.
s3427	Interestingly	,	the	naturally	occurring	microcephaly	-	associated	mutant	,	centriole_replication_(A578P	)	,	shows	a	low	affinity	for	STIL	binding	and	blocks	centriole	assembly	.	.
s4022	Our	data	indicate	that	TNFSF15	,	a	cytokine	mainly	produced	by	blood	endothelial	cells	,	facilitates	tumor_lymphangiogenesis	by	upregulating	vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_receptor_signaling_pathway_expression	in	A549	cells	,	contributing	to	lymphatic	metastasis	in	tumor	-	bearing	mice	.	.
s3284	Furthermore	,	these	in	vitro	findings	were	validated	in	vivo	and	the	ERK1/2	and	phosphorylation	/	AKT	signaling	pathways	were	involved	in	PSMB8-triggered	migration	and	proliferation	of	glioma_cells	.	.
s775	Moreover	,	adoptively	transferred	human	naive	CD4	+	T	cells	infiltrate	human	breast	cancer_orthotopic	xenografts	in	a	monocyte_chemotaxis	-	dependent	manner	.	.
s2323	The	combination	of	low	CD151	expression	and	high	mismatch_repair_expression	resulted	in	impaired	proliferation	in	four	kidney	cancer_cell	lines	,	suggesting	potential	synthetic	dosage	lethality	(	SDL	)	interactions	between	the	two	genes	.	.
s2013	This	was	confirmed	by	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_immunoreactivity	in	tumor_cells	of	metastases	with	ongoing	bone	formation	,	as	determined	by	histological	evaluation	of	van	Gieson	-	stained	sections	.	.
s673	Amyotrophic	lateral	sclerosis	(	signal_transduction	)	is	a	neurodegenerative_disease_with	strong	genetic	components	.	.
s2169	Genomics	of	tumors	identified	several	new	genes	;	including	ZNRF3	in	adrenocortical	carcinomas	,	PRKACA	in	cortisol	-	producing	adrenal	adenomas	,	ARMC5	in	primary	macronodular	adrenal_hyperplasia_and	protein_K63-linked_deubiquitination_in	pituitary	corticotroph	adenomas	.	.
s1940	The	purpose	of	this	study	was	to	conduct	a	systematic	review	and	meta	-	analysis	of	studies	investigating	the	relationship	between	dietary	fiber	intake	and	subsite	-	specific	colon	cancer	.	The	PubMed	database	was	searched	to	identify	relevant	cohort	studies	published	from	inception	to	August	2016	in	order	to	examine	individually	the	association	between	dietary	fiber	intake	and	the	risk	of	proximal	colon	cancer	(	PCC	)	,	and	that	between	dietary	fiber	intake	and	the	risk	of	distal	colon	cancer	(	regulation_of_neuron_death	)	.	.
s1473	In	the	present	study	,	the	results	obtained	from	our	previously	published	methylation	array	were	analyzed	and	10	candidate	genes	involved	in	DNA	repair	[	protein	phosphatase	4	catalytic	subunit	(	PPP4C	)	]	,	apoptosis	[	runt	related	transcription	factor	3	(	RUNX3	)	,	interferon	regulatory	factor	4	(	IRF4	)	,	ubiquitin	C	-	terminal	hydrolase	L1	(	UCHL1	)	and	tumor_protein	p53	inducible	protein	3	(	TP53I3	)	]	,	cell	proliferation	[	cyclin	D2	(	CCND2	)	and	Ras	association	domain	family	member	1	(	RASSF1	)	]	,	drug	metabolism	[	aldehyde	dehydrogenase	1	family	member	A3	(	retinoic_acid_biosynthetic_process	)	and	solute	carrier	family	29	member	1	(	SLC29A1	)	]	and	angiogenesis	[	human	immunodeficiency	virus-1	tat	interactive	protein	2	(	HTATIP2	)	]	were	selected	for	quantification	of	their	methylation	levels	in	54	CCA	and	19	adjacent	normal	tissues	using	methylation	-	sensitive	high	-	resolution	melting	.	.
s531	Protein	kinase	A	(	PKA	)	signaling	pathway	including	adenylate_cyclase	-	inhibiting_G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway	,	RDX	,	and	RAB13	genes	were	identified	as	potential	mechanisms	for	the	activity	of	garlic	extract	in	cancer_prevention	.	.
s305	Although	there	are	nearly	100	different	causative	genes	identified	for	nonsyndromic	hearing_loss_(NSHL	)	,	Sanger	sequencing	-	based	DNA	diagnostics	usually	only	analyses	three	,	namely	,	GJB2	,	regulation_of_pH	,	and	OTOF	.	.
s1954	The	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_is	a	tumor_suppressor	gene	and	found	to	interact	with	p53	,	the	trigger	for	apoptosis	through	BCl2	family	genes	and	a	regulator	of	Notch	signaling	pathway	for	the	self	-	renewal	of	stem	cells	.	.
s328	Here	,	we	have	performed	a	prospective	nationwide	genetic	association	study	using	the	Human	Exome	BeadChip	and	identified	gene	variants	in	encoding	dynactin	4	(	DCTN4	)	,	retinoic	acid	early	transcript	1E	(	natural_killer_cell_mediated_cytotoxicity	)	,	and	V	-	akt	murine	thymoma	viral	oncogene	homolog	3	(	AKT3	)	to	be	associated	with	unfavourable	outcome	in	patients	with	pneumococcal	meningitis	.	.
s464	The	present	study	further	revealed	that	cancer_cell	death	was	primarily	caused	by	ATP	exhaustion	in	excessive	DNA	repair	with	high	protein_ADP	-	ribosylation-1	activity	.	.
s224	Leber	s	hereditary	optic	neuropathy_(biological_process	)	is	the	most	common	mitochondrial	disorder	.	.
s2525	protein_phosphorylation_knockout	phenocopied	Zyxin	knockdown	in	colon	cancer	cells	,	while	ectopic	expression	of	CDK8	substantially	restored	the	tumorigenic	defects	of	Zyxin	-	depletion	cells	.	.
s1789	Although	some	recent	studies	suggest	that	the	obesity	-	related	SNPs	in	DNA_dealkylation_involved_in_DNA_repair_influence	obesity	susceptibility	likely	through	altering	the	expression	of	the	adjacent	genes	such	as	IRX3	and	RrelationIP1L	,	rather	than	FTO	itself	,	a	solid	link	between	the	SNP	risk	genotype	and	the	increased	FTO	expression	in	both	human	blood	cells	and	fibroblasts	has	been	reported	.	.
s2480	Accordingly	,	women	with	high	expression	of	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_in	tumor_tissue	displayed	worse	survival	,	which	was	not	observed	in	men	.	.
s3033	A	bioinformatic	analysis	of	the	open	RNA	-	Seq	database	from	The	Cancer	Genome	Atlas	(	TCGA	)	liver	hepatocellular_carcinoma_(LIHC	)	cohort	revealed	a	significant	negative	correlation	between	negative_regulation_of_translation_and	CLN1	expression	.	.
s3680	Cisplatin	(	Cnervous_system_development	)	is	used	in	the	treatment	of	non	-	small	cell	lung	cancer_(NSCLC	)	,	but	due	to	the	development	of	resistance	,	the	benefit	has	been	limited	.	.
s1756	Furthermore	,	pyruvate_metabolic_process	-	M	silencing	abrogated	cancer_growth	in	a	lung	cancer	cell	xenograft	model	.	.
s677	Alterations	of	von	Hippel	-	Lindau	(	VHL	)	,	succinate	dehydrogenase	(	SDHX	)	,	and	negative_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_have	been	associated	with	the	development	of	pheochromocytomas	(	PCs	)	and	paragangliomas_(PGLs	)	and	are	also	associated	with	the	development	of	renal	neoplasms	.	.
s517	Independently	,	the	same	approach	identified	a	second	homozygous	truncating	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_variant	in	another	multiplex	consanguineous	family	affected	by	severe	myopia	,	retinal	detachment	,	and	milder	skeletal	involvement	.	.
s832	Bartter	syndrome	type	3	is	a	clinically	heterogeneous_hereditary	salt	-	losing	tubulopathy	caused	by	mutations	of	the	chloride	voltage	-	gated	channel	Kb	gene	(	excretion	)	,	which	encodes	the	ClC	-	Kb	chloride	channel	involved	in	NaCl	reabsorption	in	the	renal	tubule	.	.
s1441	Since	the	protein	expression	of	both	defense_response_to_bacterium_and	EpoR	is	induced	by	hypoxia	,	which	is	frequently	present	in	lung	cancer	,	the	cells	were	treated	with	Epo	under	both	normoxic	and	hypoxic	conditions	(	1	%	O2	)	.	.
s3297	Targeting	negative_regulation_of_kinase_activity_may	be	a	promising	strategy	for	anticancer_therapeutics	.
s216	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal	recessive	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy_(SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	ion_transport	)	.	.
s3415	Altogether	,	these	data	suggest	that	Polyphyllin	I	can	inhibit	the	proliferation	of	gastric	cancer_cells	by	downregulating	the	expression	of	FAP	and	neutrophil_apoptotic_process_in	CAFs	in	vivo	.
s2376	However	autosomal_recessive_inheritance_with	mutation	in	the	phosphate_ion_transport_gene	is	suspected	.
s3247	These	results	increase	our	knowledge	about	the	DNA_repair_and	RAD51D	mutation	spectrum	and	support	the	notion	that	these	genes	should	be	included	in	the	gene	panel	testing	performed	on	patients	with	hereditary	breast	and	ovarian	cancer_syndrome	.
s2115	The	expression	level	of	lncRNA	FEZF	-	AS1	and	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_was	determined	by	the	quantitative	Real	-	time	PCR	in	160	cases	of	NSCLC	tissues	and	their	adjacent	non	-	tumour_tissues	.	.
s67	The	created	databases	include	ACAD8	(	isobutyryl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	deficiency	(	IBD	)	)	,	ACADSB	(	short	-	chain	acyl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	(	SCAD	)	deficiency	)	,	AUH	(	3-methylglutaconic	aciduria	(	3-MGCA	)	)	,	DHCR7	(	Smith	-	Lemli	-	Opitz	syndrome	)	,	acetyl	-	CoA_metabolic_process_(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl	-	CoA	synthase	2	deficiency	)	,	HSD17B10	(	17-beta	-	hydroxysteroid	dehydrogenase	X	deficiency	)	,	FKBP14	(	Ehlers	-	Danlos	syndrome	with	progressive	kyphoscoliosis	,	myopathy	,	and	hearing_loss	,	EDSKMH	)	and	ROGDI	(	Kohlschutter	-	Tonz	syndrome	)	.	.
s2578	A	decreased	gene	expression	(	RQ	AAAA	0.7	)	was	observed	for	DLEC1	in	60.9	%	of	tumour_samples	,	for	mismatch_repair_in	50.7	%	and	for	TUSC4	in	26	%	of	NSCLC	samples	.	.
s3632	We	found	that	multiple	oncogenic	tyrosine	kinases	directly	phosphorylated	peptidyl	-	threonine_dephosphorylation_at	Tyr-94	,	and	Tyr-94	phosphorylation	of	PDP1	was	common	in	diverse	human	cancer_cells	and	primary	leukemia	cells	from	patients	.	.
s384	Marden	-	Walker	syndrome	is	challenging	to	diagnose	,	as	there	is	significant	overlap	with	other	multi	-	system	congenital	contracture_syndromes	including	Beals	congenital	contractural	arachnodactyly	,	dermatan_sulfate_proteoglycan_metabolic_process	-	Deficient	Ehlers	-	Danlos	syndrome	(	adducted	thumb	-	clubfoot	syndrome	)	,	Schwartz	-	Jampel	syndrome	,	Freeman	-	Sheldon	syndrome	,	Cerebro	-	oculo	-	facio	-	skeletal	syndrome	,	and	Van	den	Ende	-	Gupta	syndrome	.	.
s1632	Existing	research	points	to	the	potential	use	of	various	positive_regulation_of_cell	-	matrix_adhesion	/	ephrin	members	as	biomarkers	for	assessing	prognosis	and	selecting	the	most	suitable	therapeutic	strategies	in	variable	clinical	scenarios	,	also	for	overcoming	drug	resistance	,	in	the	era	of	breast	cancer_heterogeneity	.
s3611	Zinc	finger	MYND	-	type	-	containing	10	(	outer_dynein_arm_assembly	)	,	a	cytoplasmic	protein	expressed	in	ciliated	cells	,	causes	primary	ciliary_dyskinesia_(PCD	)	when	mutated	,	however	,	its	function	is	poorly	understood	.	.
s2883	We	identified	biological_process_homozygous	null	variants	(	c.187AAAAAT	,	p	.	K63	_	and	c.79	-	2AAAAAG	,	p	.	V27Wfs	14	)	in	two	kindreds	with	early	-	onset	parkinsonism	.	.
s2004	Patients	with	non	-	oxidation	-	reduction_process_driven	metastases	may	,	however	,	benefit	from	therapies	targeting	the	tumor_microenvironment	.	.
s905	Finally	,	in	vivo	experiments	confirmed	that	eye_development_acted	as	a	tumor_suppressor	gene	in	suppressing	tumor	growth	and	metastasis	.
s811	We	found	that	hypermethylation	of	mitotic_cytokinesis_and	reduced	gene	expression	was	prevalent	in	several	types	of	human	cancers	.	.
s727	Recently	mutations	in	the	central_nervous_system_myelination	/	CNTN1	complex	have	been	associated	with	similar	severe	phenotypes	and	CNTNAP1	gene	mutations	,	causing	loss	of	the	CASPR	protein	,	were	shown	to	cause	severe	,	prenatal	onset	arthrogryposis_multiplex	congenita	in	four	unrelated	families	.	.
s3195	Non	-	invasive	follicular	thyroid	neoplasm	with	papillary	-	like	nuclear	features	(	NIFTP	)	is	an	indolent	thyroid	tumor_characterized	by	frequent	RAS	mutations	and	an	absence	of	the	protein_phosphorylation_V600E	mutation	commonly	seen	in	classical	papillary	thyroid	carcinoma	(	cPTC	)	.	.
s2631	To	further	understand	why	S	-	adenosylmethionine_cycle_inhibitors	decreased	prostate	cancer_cell	growth	,	we	performed	microRNA	expression	profiling	with	LNCaP	-	hr	cells	.	.
s2666	cytoskeletal_anchoring_at_plasma_membrane	-	related	disorders	are	classified	as	spondylocarpotarsal	synostosis	(	SCT	)	,	Larsen	syndrome	(	LS	)	,	atelosteogenesis	(	AO	)	,	boomerang	dysplasia	(	BD	)	,	and	isolated	congenital	talipes	equinovarus	,	presenting	with	scoliosis	,	short	-	limbed	dwarfism	,	clubfoot	,	joint	dislocation	and	other	unique	skeletal	abnormalities	.	.
s370	Previous	studies	have	implicated	biological_processed	-	coil	domain	-	containing	protein	8	(	CCDC8	)	as	a	tumor	suppressor	in	several	types	of	cancer	,	such	as	breast	and	prostate	cancers	.	.
s2457	positive_regulation_of_cytokine	-	mediated_signaling_pathway_has	been	defined	as	a	novel	target	for	cancer_therapeutics	.	.
s2880	Biallelic	biological_process_mutations	were	described	in	children	with	hyperphenylalaninemia	,	neurodevelopmental	delay	,	and	dystonia	.	.
s3442	Germline	mutations	in	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination_are	associated	with	increased	risk	of	breast	and	ovarian	cancer	and	BRCA1	deficient	tumors	are	exquisitely	sensitive	to	poly	(	ADP	-	ribose	)	polymerase	(	PARP	)	inhibitors	.	.
s3011	This	led	to	the	identification	of	compound	heterozygous	mutations	in	negative_regulation_of_phosphatase_activity	,	a	gene	previously	associated	with	cerebellar	ataxia	,	intellectual_disability_and	quadrupedal	locomotion	.	.
s2569	The	aim	of	this	study	was	to	assess	the	relationship	between	the	negative_regulation_of_cell_proliferation	,	TUSC4	and	MLH1	mRNA	expression	,	and	clinical	features	of	NSCLC	patients	,	tobacco	addiction	,	and	tumour_histopathological	characteristics	.	.
s3667	In	the	PPI	network	,	2	clusters	of	VTE	genes	,	including	ribosomal	protein	family	genes	and	NADH	family	-	ubiquinol	-	cytochrome	genes	,	were	identified	,	such	as	ribosomal	protein	L9	(	RPL9	)	,	RPL5	,	nuclear	-	transcribed_mRNA_catabolic_process,_nonsense	-	mediated_decay	,	RPL23	,	and	tumor_protein	p53	(	TP53).The	nod	-	like	receptor	signaling	pathway	,	ribosomal	protein	family	genes	,	such	as	RPL9	,	RPL5	,	RPS20	,	and	RPL23	,	and	DEG	of	TP53	may	have	the	potential	to	be	used	as	targets	for	diagnosis	and	treatment	of	VTE	.
s1996	Conversely	,	regulation_of_translation_loss	led	to	the	early	-	onset	death	of	cochlear	hair	cells	and	consequently	accelerated	hearing_loss	.	.
s2727	However	,	certain	chromatin	remodeling	genes	(	MLL1	,	MLL2	,	MLL3	,	BAP1	,	negative_regulation_of_cell_proliferation	,	EED	,	and	ATRX	)	were	found	to	be	mutated	in	7/22	(	32	%	)	of	intraductal	tubulopapillary	neoplasms	and	27	%	harbored	phosphatidylinositol	3-kinase	(	PI3	K	)	pathway	(	PIK3CA	,	PIK3CB	,	INPP4A	,	and	PTEN	)	mutations	.	.
s2430	The	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_transcription	factor	and	its	target	genes	have	been	implicated	in	developmental	brain	diseases	with	a	prominent	language	component	,	such	as	developmental	verbal_dyspraxia_and	specific	language	impairment	.	.
s3709	Our	results	suggest	that	peptidyl	-	threonine_dephosphorylation_plays	a	negative	role	in	the	activation	of	the	p38-RB1-E2F1	pathway	and	that	targeting	PPM1B	could	be	useful	in	certain	types	of	cancer_by	stimulating	chemotherapy	-	induced	cell	death	.
s2244	We	have	already	reported	that	protein_polyubiquitination_mRNA	levels	are	higher	in	breast	cancer_samples	compared	to	adjacent	non	-	tumor	tissue	.	.
s3577	With	a	feature	selection	algorithm	,	we	selected	a	panel	of	five	urinary	biomarkers	(	intracellular_sequestering_of_iron_ion	,	Ferritin	light	chain	,	MAPK1IP1L	,	Mitogen	-	Activated	Protein	Kinase	1	Interacting	Protein	1	Like	,	FGB	,	Fibrinogen	Beta	Chain	,	RAB33B	,	RAB33B	,	Member	RAS	Oncogene	Family	,	RAB15	,	RAB15	,	Member	RAS	Oncogene	Family	)	and	established	a	combinatorial	model	that	can	correctly	classify	the	majority	of	lung	cancer_cases	both	in	the	training	set	(	n=46	)	and	the	test	sets	(	n=14	-	47	per	set	)	with	an	AUC	ranging	from	0.8747	to	0.9853	.	.
s117	Subsequent	Sanger	sequencing	was	performed	on	a	panel	of	individuals	from	12	French	families	affected	by	microcephaly_and	ophthalmic	manifestations	,	and	one	other	individual	was	identified	with	compound	-	heterozygous	mutations	in	mitotic_cell_cycle	.	.
s115	We	report	the	identification	of	mutations	in	protein_processing_involved_in_protein_targeting_to_mitochondrion_in	17	patients	from	four	families	affected	with	cerebellar	ataxia	,	including	the	large	Lebanese	family	previously	described	with	autosomal	recessive	cerebellar	ataxia	and	short_stature_of	Norman	type	and	localized	to	chromosome	9q34	(	OMIM	#	213200	)	.	.
s1306	Furthermore	,	the	inhibition	of	mitochondrial_pyruvate_transmembrane_transport_expression	induced	EMT	in	cancer_cells	,	and	the	overexpression	of	MPC1	suppressed	the	migration	of	tumor	cells	.	.
s2854	TBXAS1	mutations	result	in	Ghosal	hematodiaphyseal	dysplasia	(	OMIM	231095	)	,	the	autosomal	recessive	syndrome	associated	with	abnormal_bone_structure_and	negative_regulation_of_autophagy	.	.
s606	Genes	with	DMRs	were	involved	in	inflammatory	response	(	IRAK4	and	ESM1	)	,	cancer_(double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination_and	LASP1	)	,	endocrine	function	(	CNPY1	)	,	and	male	fertility	(	IFT140	,	TESC	,	and	PRDM8	)	.	.
s1284	This	first	study	addressing	effects	of	deiodinase	re	-	expression	on	proteome	of	cancer_cells	demonstrates	that	induced	transcription,_DNA	-	templated_re	-	expression	in	renal	cancer	robustly	downregulates	oncoproteins	,	affects	key	metabolic	pathways	,	and	triggers	proteins	involved	in	anti	-	oxidative	protection	.	.
s2743	Previously	reported	patients	with	UDP	-	N	-	acetylglucosamine_transmembrane_transport	-	CDG	have	been	described	with	syndromic	autism	,	epilepsy	,	and	arthrogryposis	.
s1349	The	use	of	low	fidelity	DNA	polymerases	in	the	translesional	synthesis	(	TLS	)	DNA	damage	response	pathway	that	repairs	lesions	caused	by	cisplatin	also	presents	a	mutational	carcinogenic	burden	on	cells	that	needs	to	be	regulated	by	the	tumor_suppressor	protein	DNA_strand_renaturation	.	.
s3883	We	performed	whole	-	exome	sequencing	on	a	12-year	-	old	Japanese	male	with	severe	intellectual	disability	,	congenital	bilateral	cataracts	,	spasticity	,	hypotonia	with	motor	regression	and	progressive	cerebellar_atrophy_with	hyperintensity	of	the	cerebellar	cortex	on	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation	-	weighted	images	.	.
s3779	Bardet	-	Biedl	syndrome	(	visual_perception	)	is	an	autosomal	recessive	disorder	that	is	both	genetically	and	clinically	heterogeneous	.	.
s2948	Loss	-	of	-	function	mutations	in	protein_dephosphorylation_cause	the	severe	congenital	myopathy	called	myotubular	myopathy	(	or	X	-	linked	centronuclear	myopathy	)	while	mutations	in	the	MTM1-related	protein	MTMR2	cause	a	recessive	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	peripheral_neuropathy	.	.
s4068	Thus	,	our	data	indicate	that	in	pancreatic	cancer_cells	,	the	expression	of	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_may	be	controlled	by	a	pathway	mediated	by	SMAD4	.	.
s1703	Lately	,	ARMC5	was	linked	to	the	cyclic	AMP	signaling	pathway	,	which	could	be	implicated	in	all	of	mechanisms	of	cortisol	-	secreting	by	macronodules	adrenal_hyperplasia_and	the	molecular	defects	in	,	G	protein	aberrant	receptors	,	MC2R	,	adenylate_cyclase	-	activating_G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway	,	PRKAR1A	,	PDE11A	,	PDE8B.	.
s3164	Prominent	examples	include	mutations	in	the	transporters	for	dopamine	(	DAT	,	SLC6A3	)	,	for	creatine	(	CT1	,	creatine_transmembrane_transport	)	,	and	for	glycine	(	GlyT2	,	SLC6A5	)	,	which	result	in	infantile	dystonia	,	mental	retardation	,	and	hyperekplexia	,	respectively	.	.
s170	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal_recessive_Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/positive_regulation_of_cell_aging	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy	(	SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s3743	Our	work	confirms	that	the	phenotype	and	the	mode_of_inheritance_associated	with	phototransduction,_visible_light_variants	can	vary	from	autosomal	dominant	,	autosomal	recessive	congenital	stationary	night	blindness	to	autosomal	recessive	rod	-	cone	dystrophy	.
s1124	Testicular	germ	cell	hippo_signalingncer	(	TGCC	)	is	derived	from	germ	cell	neoplasia	in	situ	(	GCNIS	)	,	which	arises	due	to	niche	disturbances	affecting	the	Sertoli	cells	.	.
s3856	Intriguingly	,	five	CPGs	showed	concordance	between	CNL	and	down	-	regulation	in	50	or	more	tumor_samples	,	MTAP	(	216	samples	)	,	PTEN	(	143	)	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_(86	)	,	SMAD4	(	63	)	,	and	MINPP1	(	51	)	,	which	may	represent	the	recurrent	driving	force	for	gene	expression	change	during	oncogenesis	.	.
s2724	All	intraductal	tubulopapillary	neoplasms	revealed	the	characteristic	histologic	(	cellular	intraductal	nodules	of	back	-	to	-	back	tubular	glands	lined	by	predominantly	cuboidal	cells	with	atypical	nuclei	and	no	obvious	intracellular	mucin	)	and	immunohistochemical	(	immunolabeled	with	MUC1	and	MUC6	but	were	negative	for	maintenance_of_gastrointestinal_epithelium_and	MUC5AC	)	features	.	.
s1528	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	desmosome_assembly	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s1631	positive_regulation_of_cell	-	matrix_adhesionA2	,	EphB4	and	EphB6	are	the	members	most	extensively	studied	in	breast	cancer	.	.
s1355	Based	upon	the	development	-	dependent	onsets	of	these	psychotomimetic	effects	,	by	using	a	DNA	microarray	technique	,	we	identified	the	WD	repeat	domain	3	(	WDR3	)	and	chitobiosyldiphosphodolichol	beta	-	mannosyltransferase	(	protein_glycosylation	)	genes	as	novel	candidates	for	schizophrenia	-	related	molecules	,	whose	mRNAs	were	up	-	regulated	in	the	adult	(	postnatal	week	seven	)	,	but	not	in	the	infant	(	postnatal	week	one	)	rats	by	an	indirect	dopamine	agonist	,	and	phencyclidine	,	an	antagonist	of	the	NMDA	receptor	.	.
s2742	Congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	,	including	UDP	-	N	-	acetylglucosamine_transmembrane_transport	-	CDG	,	can	present	as	a	wide	phenotypic	spectrum	,	including	skeletal_dysplasia	.	.
s1275	Purpose	To	determine	whether	the	rates	and	tumor_characteristics	of	screening	-	detected	and	interval	cancers	differ	for	two	-	dimensional	digital	mammography	(	DM	)	versus	digital	breast	tomosynthesis	(	biological_process	)	mammography	.	.
s3866	Allelic	heterogeneity_was	observed	at	LRRK2	while	European	risk	SNPs	at	6	other	loci	including	microtubule_cytoskeleton_organization_and	GBA	-	SYT11	were	non	-	polymorphic	or	very	rare	in	our	cohort	.	.
s3785	This	study	establishes	cellular_response_to_oxidative_stress_variants	as	a	cause	of	early	-	onset	myopathy_and	uses	biospecimens	and	cell	lines	,	yeast	,	and	zebrafish	models	to	elucidate	the	fundamental	role	of	PYROXD1	in	skeletal	muscle	.	.
s3321	Clinical	studies	have	also	revealed	that	brain_development_gain	of	function	mutations	contribute	to	coronal	craniosynostosis	,	a	rare	skull	malformation	.	.
s1142	Using	this	gene	panel	,	we	were	able	to	identify	disease	-	causing	variants	in	17	out	of	87	(	19.5	%	)	analyzed	patients	,	all	found	in	known	epilepsy	-	associated	genes	(	KCNQ2	,	CDKL5	,	STXBP1	,	SCN1A	,	PCDH19	,	POLG	,	SLC2A1	,	ARX	,	dolichol	-	linked_oligosaccharide_biosynthetic_process	,	CHD2	,	SYNGAP1	,	and	GRIN1	)	.	.
s1050	Furthermore	,	mutations	in	ion_transmembrane_transport_have	been	identified	as	a	rare	cause	of	both	familial	and	idiopathic	pulmonary_arterial_hypertension	.	.
s2507	Moreover	,	comparison	of	the	porcine	results	to	those	reported	by	human	melanoma_GWAS	indicated	shared	association	signals	notably	at	tRNA_methylthiolation_and	TERT	loci	but	also	nearby	CCND1	,	FTO	,	PLA2G6	and	TMEM38B	-	RAD23B	loci	.	.
s533	We	extended	our	findings	to	protein_phosphorylation_WT	tumor_cell	lines	that	are	intrinsically	resistant	to	vemurafenib	and	dabrafenib	.	.
s2795	The	PCH1sub	-	types	with	early	death	(	between	ages	1	day	and	17	months	)	,	seen	in	patients	with	p	.	G31A	/	EXOSC3	or	mitochondrial_membrane_fission_mutations	have	a	SMA	type	1-like	clinical	presentation	but	with	global	developmental_delay	,	visual	and	hearing	impairment	,	with	or	without	microcephaly	,	nystagmus	and	optic	atrophy	.	.
s2819	Collagen	type	4	alpha	1	(	branching_involved_in_blood_vessel_morphogenesis	)	and	collagen	type	13	alpha	1	(	COL13A1	)	produced	by	urothelial	cancer	cells	support	the	vital	oncogenic	property	of	tumor_invasion	.	.
s3629	These	findings	suggest	that	the	Warburg	pathway	enzyme	PFKFB4	acts	as	a	molecular	fulcrum	that	couples	sugar	metabolism	to	transcriptional	activation	by	stimulating	peptidyl	-	tyrosine_phosphorylation-3	to	promote	aggressive	metastatic	tumours	.
s3706	To	test	if	peptidyl	-	threonine_dephosphorylation_can	be	a	drug	target	in	the	cellular	proliferation	and	death	pathway	,	the	lentiviral	PPM1B	shRNA	was	stably	expressed	in	cancer_cell	lines	and	its	regulatory	function	in	the	RB1-E2F1	pathway	was	examined	.	.
s2651	Purposeregulation_of_synaptic_vesicle_exocytosis_deficiency	causes	neonatal	hypotonia	,	ptosis	,	neonatal	feeding	difficulties	,	childhood	obesity	,	xerostomia	,	and	growth	hormone	deficiency	.	.
s2930	Whole	exome	sequencing	of	the	patient	and	his	parents	ruled	out	mutations	in	11	known	hypodontia	-	associated	genes	including	WNT10A	,	cell_morphogenesis	,	EDA	,	EDAR	,	EDARADD	,	PAX9	,	AXIN2	,	GREM2	,	NEMO	,	KRT17	,	and	TFAP2B.	.
s1855	We	found	that	LGR5	expression	in	the	epithelium	and	stroma	was	associated	with	tumor_stage	,	and	by	integrating	functional	experiments	with	LGR5-sorted	cell	RNA	sequencing	data	from	adenoma	and	normal	organoids	,	we	found	correlations	between	LGR5	and	CRC	-	specific	genes	,	including	dickkopf	WNT	signaling	pathway	inhibitor	4	(	DKK4	)	and	negative_regulation_of_endothelial_cell_proliferation	-	related	modular	calcium	binding	2	(	SMOC2	)	.	.
s735	Mutations	in	L	-	glutamate_transmembrane_transport_are	known	to	cause	neonatal	epileptic	encephalopathy_and	migrating	partial	seizures	in	infancy	.	.
s671	Although	three	patients	with	male_gonad_development_mutations	were	reported	to	have	hypergonadotropic	hypogonadism_in	their	teens	,	the	functional	significance	of	MAMLD1	in	the	postnatal	testis	remains	unclear	.	.
s34	Exome	sequencing	revealed	an	insertion	mutation	in	sensory_perception_of_sound_as	the	cause	of	moderate	-	to	-	severe	and	likely	progressive	hearing_loss_in	the	affected	individuals	of	the	family	.	.
s792	Peroxisome	biogenesis	factor	10	(	peroxisome_organization	)	is	involved	in	the	import	of	peroxisomal	matrix	proteins	,	and	the	mutation	of	this	gene	causes	3	subtypes	of	peroxisome	biogenesis	disorders	,	namely	Zellweger	syndrome	(	severe	)	,	neonatal	adrenoleukodystrophy	(	moderate	)	and	an	ataxic	form	(	mild	)	.	.
s1023	Biallelic	mutations	in	these	genes	cause	Fanconi	anemia	(	FA	)	,	characterized	by	malformations	,	bone	marrow	failure	,	chromosome	fragility	,	and	cancer_predisposition	(	BRCA2/FANCD1	and	PALB2/FANCN	)	,	or	an	FA	-	like	disease	presenting	a	phenotype	similar	to	FA	but	without	bone	marrow	failure	(	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination	/	FANCS	)	.	.
s904	Furthermore	,	we	observed	the	hypermethylation	of	the	eye_development_promoter	in	gastric	cancer	,	which	induced	low	expression	of	CHRDL1	and	decreased	its	secretion	to	the	supernatant	.	.
s0	The	SNP	rs11102001	,	which	encodes	a	nonsynonymous	amino	acid	change	P356S	in	regulation_of_hair_cycle	,	is	a	potential	candidate	modifier	of	the	effect	of	HCAs	on	prostate	cancer_risk	.	.
s3639	The	aim	the	present	study	was	to	clarify	the	role	of	fatty_acid_metabolic_process_in	liver	cancer	.	.
s1593	In	cancer	biology	,	miRNAs	play	functional	roles	in	tumor_protein_glycosylationeding	,	drug	sensitivity	,	and	metastasis	.	.
s1742	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	ubiquitin	-	dependent_protein_catabolic_process	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s2027	Silencing	FBP1	expression	attenuated	the	decrease	in	glycolytic	capacity	that	caused	by	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_knockdown	in	pancreatic	cancer_cells	.	.
s2446	Ras	-	association	domain	family	6	(	RASSF6	)	is	a	tumor_suppressor	that	interacts	with	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_and	stabilizes	p53	.	.
s2144	The	second	most	frequently	mutated	gene	,	histone	methyltransferase	regulation_of_double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination	,	has	known	roles	in	multiple	cancers	,	but	has	not	previously	been	strongly	implicated	in	osteosarcoma	.	.
s1140	Using	this	gene	panel	,	we	were	able	to	identify	disease	-	causing	variants	in	17	out	of	87	(	19.5	%	)	analyzed	patients	,	all	found	in	known	epilepsy	-	associated	genes	(	KCNQ2	,	CDKL5	,	STXBP1	,	SCN1A	,	PCDH19	,	POLG	,	protein	-	containing_complex_assembly	,	ARX	,	ALG13	,	CHD2	,	SYNGAP1	,	and	GRIN1	)	.	.
s1343	MATERIAL	AND	METHODS	A	total	of	63	paired	gastric	cancer_tissues	and	matched	adjacent	mucosa	were	used	to	measure	the	response_to_calcium_ion_levels	and	its	correlation	with	clinical	characteristics	.	.
s678	Alterations	of	von	Hippel	-	Lindau	(	VHL	)	,	succinate	dehydrogenase	(	SDHX	)	,	and	TMEM127	have	been	associated	with	the	development	of	pheochromocytomas	(	PCs	)	and	paragangliomas_(pentose	-	phosphate_shunt	)	and	are	also	associated	with	the	development	of	renal	neoplasms	.	.
s3318	Models	evaluated	include	a	neuroblastoma_cell	line	(	SK	-	N	-	AS	)	and	immortalized	keratinocytes	(	HaCaT	)	as	a	control	of	high	skeletal_system_development_production	.	.
s2310	Hermansky	-	Pudlak	syndrome	(	melanosome_assembly	)	,	first	described	in	1959	,	is	a	rare	form	of	syndromic	oculocutaneous	albinism_associated	with	bleeding	diathesis	and	in	some	cases	pulmonary	fibrosis	and	granulomatous	colitis	.	.
s2945	Hence	,	we	focus	on	the	relationship	between	YAP	/	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_and	serine	metabolism	to	control	methylation	of	DNA	or	histone	in	breast	cancer_with	LKB1	deficiency	.	.
s1683	Seventy	resected	tumours	were	dissociated	into	single	cells	and	stained	with	antibodies	to	hyaluronan_catabolic_process_as	well	as	CD45	and	CD31	(	together	referred	as	Lineage	/	Lin	)	.	.
s2693	We	sequenced	GATM	,	GAMT	and	creatine_transmembrane_transport_genes	in	166	patients	with	autism_(coding	sequence	,	introns	and	adjacent	untranslated	regions	)	.	.
s1670	Mutations	in	anterograde_neuronal_dense_core_vesicle_transport_are	responsible	for	autosomal_recessive_spastic	paraplegia	type	58	(	SPG58	)	and	spastic	ataxia	2	(	SPAX2	)	.	.
s3477	But	the	role	of	definitive_hemopoiesis_in	breast	cancer_remains	unclear	.	.
s3178	In	addition	,	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_was	found	to	be	related	to	the	spheroid	-	forming	ability	of	cells	and	to	be	involved	in	the	invasive	capacity	of	pancreatic	cancer_cells	.
s1527	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	establishment_of_skin_barrier	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s2241	BACKGROUND	This	study	aimed	to	investigate	the	mechanism	of	regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_gene	dysfunction	in	drug	resistance	of	triple	negative	breast	cancer_(TNBC	)	cells	.	.
s746	Hyper	-	methylated	CpG	loci	included	the	known	the	tumor_suppressor	gene	RET	(	p	=	5.72	x	10	-	10	)	,	as	well	as	loci	in	differentially	methylated	regions	for	GSG1L	,	MIR4493	,	NTNG1	,	MCIDAS	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	and	RERG	.	.
s1520	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	chemotaxis	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s2212	The	triggering	receptor	expressed	on	myeloid	cells	2	(	positive_regulation_of_antigen_processing_and_presentation_of_peptide_antigen_via_MHC_class_II	)	is	a	microglial	innate	immune	receptor	associated	with	a	lethal	form	of	early	,	progressive_dementia	,	Nasu	-	Hakola	disease	,	and	with	an	increased	risk	of	Alzheimer	s	disease	.	.
s1283	Expression	of	transcription,_DNA	-	templated	-	affected	genes	strongly	correlated	with	DIO1	transcript	levels	in	tissue	samples	from	renal	cancer_patients	as	well	as	with	their	poor	survival	.	.
s3668	In	the	PPI	network	,	2	clusters	of	VTE	genes	,	including	ribosomal	protein	family	genes	and	NADH	family	-	ubiquinol	-	cytochrome	genes	,	were	identified	,	such	as	ribosomal	protein	L9	(	RPL9	)	,	RPL5	,	RPS20	,	protein	-	DNA_complex_disassembly	,	and	tumor_protein	p53	(	TP53).The	nod	-	like	receptor	signaling	pathway	,	ribosomal	protein	family	genes	,	such	as	RPL9	,	RPL5	,	RPS20	,	and	RPL23	,	and	DEG	of	TP53	may	have	the	potential	to	be	used	as	targets	for	diagnosis	and	treatment	of	VTE	.
s1332	We	summarize	the	phenotypic	extent	of	smoothened_signaling_pathway/3	syndromes	in	the	literature	and	determine	that	these	2	syndromes	manifest	opposite	features	to	a	certain	extent	,	such	as	midface_hypoplasia_or	macrocephaly	,	and	anterior	or	posterior	side	of	polydactyly	.	.
s758	This	study	showed	that	AMP_biosynthetic_process_myopathy	was	not	rare	among	distal_myopathy	patients	of	Korean	origin	,	and	expanded	the	clinical	and	genetic	spectrum	.	.
s900	Thus	,	therapeutic	inhibition	of	one	GOF	DNA_strand_renaturation	-	induced	pathway	would	be	insufficient	to	prevent	tumor_growth	as	the	oncoprotein	activates	a	multitude	of	parallel	pathways	.	.
s196	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal	recessive	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/neurofilament_bundle_assembly	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy_(SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s3386	Prolyl	endopeptidase	-	like	(	regulation_of_synaptic_vesicle_exocytosis	)	deficiency	(	MIM	#	616224	)	is	a	rare	autosomal	recessive	inherited	congenital	myasthenic	syndrome	characterized	by	neonatal	hypotonia	,	feeding_problems	,	mild	dysmorphism	,	and	neuromuscular	symptoms	,	followed	by	hyperphagia	and	obesity	in	later	childhood	.	.
s2044	Pathogenic	or	likely	pathogenic	cancer_susceptibility	gene	alterations	were	found	in	7	of	the	87	(	8	%	)	CS	/	CS	-	like	and	BRRS	patients	and	included	DNA_repair	,	RET	,	TSC2	,	BRCA1	,	BRCA2	,	ERCC2	and	HRAS	.	.
s2069	This	review	summarizes	the	current	knowledge	of	tumorigenesis	and	tumor	progression	in	early	lung	adenocarcinoma	,	with	special	focus	on	its	clinicopathological	characteristics	and	their	associations	with	driver	mutations	(	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	,	KRAS	,	and	BRAF	)	as	well	as	on	its	molecular	pathogenesis	and	progression	.
s3351	PCP	signalling	disruption	caused	by	Vangl2	(	Vangl2Lp/+	)	or	establishment_of_planar_polarity_(Celsr1Crsh/+	)	mutations	significantly	reduced	trabecular	bone	mass	and	distal_tibial	cortical	thickness	.	.
s3238	Expression	of	MET	-	signaling	genes	in	human	lymphoblastoid	cells	of	individuals	homozygous	for	p	.	Gly116Glu	GAB1	revealed	dysregulation	of	HGF	,	MET	,	SHP2	,	and	negative_regulation_of_peptidyl	-	threonine_phosphorylation	,	all	of	which	have	reported	variants	associated	with	deafness	.	.
s585	Gene	-	based	tests	highlighted	20	additional	genes	of	which	5	had	previously	been	associated	to	schizophrenia_and	/	or	bipolar	disorder	,	CSMD1	,	biological_process	,	SLC1A2	,	CACNA1C	,	and	SNAP25	.	.
s37	Our	results	indicate	that	sensory_perception_of_sound_should	be	considered	in	differential	genetic	diagnosis	for	individuals	with	early	onset	,	moderate	-	to	-	severe	and	progressive	hearing_loss	.	.
s1545	Mechanistically	,	lncSHGL	recruited	heterogeneous_nuclear	ribonucleoprotein	A1	(	hnRNPA1	)	to	enhance	the	translation	efficiency	of	CALM	mRNAs	to	increase	calmodulin	(	CaM	)	protein	level	without	affecting	their	transcription	,	leading	to	the	activation	of	the	phosphatidyl	inositol	3-kinase	(	PI3K)/Akt	pathway	and	repression	of	the	mTOR	/	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_pathway	independent	of	insulin	and	calcium	in	hepatocytes	.	.
s52	The	created	databases	include	ACAD8	(	isobutyryl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	deficiency	(	IBD	)	)	,	ACADSB	(	short	-	chain	acyl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	(	SCAD	)	deficiency	)	,	AUH	(	3-methylglutaconic	aciduria	(	3-MGCA	)	)	,	cholesterol_biosynthetic_process_(Smith	-	Lemli	-	Opitz	syndrome	)	,	HMGCS2	(	3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl	-	CoA	synthase	2	deficiency	)	,	HSD17B10	(	17-beta	-	hydroxysteroid	dehydrogenase	X	deficiency	)	,	FKBP14	(	Ehlers	-	Danlos	syndrome	with	progressive	kyphoscoliosis	,	myopathy	,	and	hearing	loss	,	EDSKMH	)	and	ROGDI	(	Kohlschutter	-	Tonz	syndrome	)	.	.
s2077	Carboxyl	terminus	of	protein_glycosylation-70-interacting	protein	(	CHIP	)	is	an	E3	ubiquitin	ligase	that	induces	the	ubiquitination	and	degradation	of	numerous	tumor	-	associated	proteins	and	serves	as	a	suppressor	or	promoter	in	tumor	progression	.	.
s836	In	neonatal	seizures	,	defects	in	cellular_aldehyde_metabolic_process_and	PNPO	explain	a	major	fraction	of	cases	.	.
s3079	Result	,	Three	mutant	genes	(	PTPN11	gene	in	chromosome	12	,	Ras_protein_signal_transduction_gene	in	chromosome	1	and	RAF1	gene	in	chromosome	3	)	in	five	cases	all	had	been	reported	to	be	related	to	hypertrophic	cardiomyopathy	.	.
s3441	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination_is	a	tumor_suppressor	that	regulates	DNA	repair	by	homologous	recombination	.	.
s1626	In	this	review	,	we	focus	on	the	association	of	gene	and	protein	of	triglyceride_metabolic_process_with	obesity_and	metabolic	syndrome	,	and	provide	new	insights	into	the	physiological	role	of	apoA5	in	humans	,	giving	a	potential	therapeutic	target	for	obesity	and	associated	disorders	.
s107	We	validated	ZBTB20	,	mRNA_splice_site_selection	,	PARD3	,	AKAP13	and	WAC	,	which	were	identified	by	our	screens	in	multiple	cancer	types	,	as	new	tumor_suppressor	genes	in	prostate	cancer	.	.
s776	In	human	breast	cancer	xenografts	in	humanized	mice	,	blocking	the	recruitment	of	naive	CD4	+	T	cells	into	tumor_by	knocking	down	the	expression	of	PITPNM3	,	a	monocyte_chemotaxis_receptor	,	significantly	reduces	intratumoral	Tregs	and	inhibits	tumor	progression	.	.
s2030	Taken	together	,	these	data	reveal	that	CBX3	serves	as	a	positive	regulator	of	aerobic	glycolysis	via	suppressing	of	the	fructose_6-phosphate_metabolic_process_in	pancreatic	cancer_cells	.	.
s3687	Pathogenic	variants	in	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_were	recently	described	in	three	back	-	to	-	back	publications	in	association	with	a	novel	neurodevelopmental	disorder	characterized	by	intellectual	disability	,	speech_delay	,	ataxia	,	and	facial	dysmorphisms	.	.
s1691	Exome	analysis	of	APA	has	allowed	the	identification	of	recurrent	somatic	mutations	in	potassium_ion_import_across_plasma_membrane	,	CACNA1D	,	ATP1A1	,	and	ATP2B3	in	more	than	50	%	of	sporadic_cases	.	.
s3916	This	similarity	was	revealed	by	the	same	number	of	passages	,	the	same	germ	cell	clusters	formation	and	similar	level	of	genes	expression	of	spermatogonial	markers	including	ubiquitin	carboxyl	-	terminal	esterase	L1	(	UCHL1	)	,	zinc	finger	and	BTB	domain	containing	16	(	ZBTB16	)	and	glial	cell	line	-	derived	neurotrophic	factor	family	receptor	alpha	1	(	GFRA1	)	,	as	well	as	germ	cell	differentiation	markers	including	signal	transducer	and	activator	of	transcription	3	(	STAT3	)	,	spermatogenesis	and	oogenesis	specific	basic	helix	-	loophelix	2	(	SOHLH2	)	,	v	-	kit	Hardy	-	Zuckerman	4	feline	sarcoma_viral	oncogene	homolog	(	KIT	)	and	synaptonemal	complex	protein	3	(	spermatogenesis,_exchange_of_chromosomal_proteins	)	.	.
s818	Mutations	in	skeletal_muscle_tissue_regeneration_are	associated	with	autosomal_recessive_retinitis	pigmentosa	(	arRP	)	and	autosomal	recessive	cone	-	rod	dystrophy	(	arCRD	)	however	,	the	function	of	EYS	and	the	molecular	mechanisms	of	how	these	mutations	cause	retinal	degeneration	are	still	unclear	.	.
s482	In	this	study	,	we	report	a	family	with	X	-	linked	recessive	syndrome	caused	by	mutated	biological_process_and	characterized	by	elliptocytosis	with	or	without	anemia	,	midface	hypoplasia	,	proportionate	short_stature_and	hearing	loss	.	.
s3600	We	previously	demonstrated	that	transforming	growth	factor	-	protein_localization_to_cilium_(TGF	-	b1	)	promotes	the	epithelial	-	mesenchymal	transition	(	EMT	)	of	human	oral	squamous_cell_carcinoma_(hOSCC	)	cells	,	however	,	it	remains	to	be	clarified	whether	the	TGF	-	b	superfamily	member	bone	morphogenetic	protein	(	BMP	)	affects	this	process	in	hOSCC	cells	.	.
s2403	We	screened	95	sporadic_patients	diagnosed	as	MBS	or	HCFP	for	mutations	in	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	.	.
s2285	Idiopathic	hypogonadotropic	hypogonadism_(smoothened_signaling_pathway	)	is	characterized	by	low	levels	of	gonadotropins	and	delayed	or	absent	sexual	development	.	.
s2189	The	tumor	suppressor	protein_polyubiquitination-145	has	been	reported	to	be	lowly	expressed	in	numerous	types	of	human	cancer	,	in	the	present	study	,	the	expression	levels	of	miR-145	were	decreased	in	patients	with	NSCLC	.	.
s710	We	report	a	sibling	pair	with	FTHS	caused	by	a	homozygous	,	novel	mutation	pLys133Glnfs	13	in	the	superoxide_metabolic_process_gene	,	one	sibling	had	bilateral	ocular	hypertension	and	unilateral	colobomas	of	iris	,	choroid	and	retina	,	the	other	,	unilateral	myelinated	nerve	fiber	layer	of	the	optic	disk	and	papilledema	due	to	idiopathic	intracranial_hypertension	.	.
s1860	Accumulated	evidence	has	suggested	that	microRNAs	(	protein_polyubiquitinationNAs	)	have	an	important	role	in	tumor_development	and	progression	by	regulating	diverse	signaling	pathways	.	.
s3031	Specific	inhibition	of	mitoribosomal	translation	by	doxycycline	,	chloramphenicol	,	or	siRNA	-	mediated	negative_regulation_of_translation_knockdown	decreased	mitochondrial	protein	expression	,	reduced	oxygen	consumption	rate	,	and	increased	CLN1-mediated	tumor_cell	invasiveness	in	SNU387	cells	,	which	have	active	mitochondria	.	.
s3759	Here	we	provide	structural	and	biochemical	data	that	biological_process_contains	a	tubulin	-	binding	TOG	(	tumor_overexpressed	gene	)	domain	and	a	novel	C2HC	zinc	finger	array	.	.
s2560	Expectedly	,	the	analysis	of	the	DEGs	common	to	all	three	alterations	highlighted	a	group	of	BioFunctions	that	included	Cell	Proliferation	of	tumor	cell	lines	(	14	DEGs	)	,	Invasion	of	cells	(	10	DEGs	)	and	Migration	of	tumour_cell	lines	(	10	DEGs	)	,	with	a	common	core	of	5	genes	(	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	CDKN1A	,	GDF15	,	HBEGF	and	LCN2	)	that	likely	represent	downstream	effectors	of	the	pro	-	oncogenic	activities	of	PI3K	/	AKT	signalling	.	.
s586	Gene	-	based	tests	highlighted	20	additional	genes	of	which	5	had	previously	been	associated	to	schizophrenia_and	/	or	bipolar	disorder	,	CSMD1	,	CCDC141	,	L	-	glutamate_transmembrane_transport	,	CACNA1C	,	and	SNAP25	.	.
s3920	To	evaluate	whether	germline	variants	in	genes	encoding	pancreatic	secretory	enzymes	contribute	to	pancreatic	cancer_susceptibility	,	we	sequenced	the	coding	regions	of	CPB1	and	other	genes	encoding	pancreatic	secretory	enzymes	and	known	pancreatitis	susceptibility	genes	(	PRSS1	,	CPA1	,	cobalamin_metabolic_process	,	and	SPINK1	)	in	a	hospital	series	of	pancreatic	cancer	cases	and	controls	.	.
s2641	Methylation	profiling	,	metabolite	assessment	and	additional	analyses	were	also	performed	in	selected	cases	.	Results	,	One	of	the	11	tumors	was	found	to	carry	a	known	cancer	-	predisposing	somatic	mutation	in	IDH1	A	variant	in	aspartate_catabolic_process	,	c.357AAAAAT	,	found	in	a	patient	with	multiple	tumors	,	was	associated	with	higher	tumor	mRNA	and	protein	expression	levels	,	increased	GOT2	enzymatic	activity	in	lymphoblastic	cells	,	and	altered	metabolite	ratios	both	in	tumors	and	in	GOT2	knockdown	HeLa	cells	transfected	with	the	variant	.	.
s1726	miR-142	-	3p	overexpression	resulted	in	a	strong	decline	in	breast	cancer_stem	cell	characteristics	with	a	decrease	in	CD44	,	CD133	,	ALDH1	,	negative_regulation_of_phosphoprotein_phosphatase_activity	,	BRCA2	,	and	mammosphere	formation	as	well	as	reduced	survival	after	irradiation	.	.
s172	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal_recessive_Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/neurofilament_bundle_assembly	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy	(	SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s2284	Variants	of	WNK1	(	lysine	deficient	protein	kinase	1	)	,	ADRB2	(	b2	adrenergic	receptor	)	,	NEDD4L	(	ubiquitin	-	protein	ligase	NEDD4-like	)	,	KLK1	(	kallikrein	1	)	contribute	to	hypertension	,	and	protein_import_into_nucleus,_translocation_(aldo	-	keto	reductase	family1	member	C3	)	,	is	associated	with	preeclampsia	.	.
s1663	The	action	of	the	collagen	binding	receptor	tyrosine	kinase	(	RTK	)	discoidin	domain	receptor	2	(	peptidyl	-	tyrosine_phosphorylation	)	in	both	tumor_and	tumor	stromal	cells	has	been	established	as	critical	for	breast	cancer	metastasis	.	.
s1229	However	,	the	role	of	pyridoxal_phosphate_biosynthetic_process_and	its	regulatory	mechanism	in	epithelial	ovarian	cancer_(EOC	)	are	unknown	.	.
s886	Furthermore	,	SCAR	markers	apoptotic_nuclear_changes-1	and	BC13	-	4	might	be	useful	diagnostic	markers	for	breast	cancer_carcinomas	.
s2438	The	diagnosis	is	based	on	genetic	criteria	,	by	the	identification	of	inactivating	pathogenic	mutation	of	tumor_suppressor	genes	TSC1	and	positive_regulation_of_macroautophagy	,	and	clinical	criteria	,	including	cutaneous	,	renal	,	pulmonary	,	cardiac	and	neurological	manifestations	.	.
s3066	Missense	mutations	of	the	human	mitochondrial	citrate	carrier	,	encoded	by	the	mitochondrial_citrate_transmembrane_transport_gene	,	lead	to	an	autosomal	recessive	neurometabolic	disorder	characterised	by	neonatal	-	onset	encephalopathy_with	severe	muscular	weakness	,	intractable	seizures	,	respiratory	distress	,	and	lack	of	psychomotor	development	,	often	resulting	in	early	death	.	.
s79	In	Mfrprd6	eyes	,	a	significant	1.5-	to	2.0-fold	decrease	was	observed	among	transcripts	of	genes	linked	to	retinal_degeneration	,	including	those	involved	in	visual	cycle	(	zeaxanthin_biosynthetic_process	,	Lrat	,	Rgr	)	,	phototransduction	(	Pde6a	,	Guca1b	,	Rgs9	)	,	and	photoreceptor	disc	morphogenesis	(	Rrelationip1	and	Fscn2	)	.	.
s2265	Here	,	we	disrupt	the	peroxiredoxin	1	(	natural_killer_cell_activation	)	and	7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine	triphosphatase	(	MTH1	)	genes	in	cancer_cells	and	demonstrate	that	PRDX1	and	MTH1	cooperate	to	prevent	accumulation	of	oxidized	guanine	in	the	genome	.	.
s3381	Mutations	in	the	KVS	subunit	,	potassium_ion_transmembrane_transport_(KCNV2	)	,	lead	to	severe	visual_impairment_in	humans	,	but	the	basis	of	these	deficits	remains	unclear	.	.
s3003	Our	findings	designate	NR0B1	as	a	druggable	transcriptional	regulator	that	supports	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	-	dependent	lung	cancers	.
s1826	In	addition	,	reduced	hair	follicles	(	HFs	)	while	the	enlarged	and	increased	number	of	sebaceous	glands	(	SGs	)	were	also	found	in	the	anatomical_structure_morphogenesis-/-	rabbits	,	showing	that	the	disrupted	balance	between	HFs	and	SGs	may	respond	to	hypotrichosis_of	ECTD-9	in	an	animal	model	and	clinically	.	.
s150	The	expression	assays	did	not	detect	protein_palmitoylation_gene	expression	in	the	patient	,	thus	questioning	its	involvement	in	intellectual_disability	.	.
s1751	PEPCK	-	M	(	pyruvate_metabolic_process	)	,	the	mitochondrial	isoform	of	phosphoenolpyruvate	carboxykinase	(	PEPCK	)	,	has	been	shown	by	us	and	others	to	be	functionally	expressed	and	to	mediate	gluconeogenesis	,	the	reverse	pathway	of	glycolysis	,	in	different	cancer_cells	.	.
s3414	Altogether	,	these	data	suggest	that	Polyphyllin	I	can	inhibit	the	proliferation	of	gastric	cancer_cells	by	downregulating	the	expression	of	proteolysis_and	HGF	in	CAFs	in	vivo	.
s2006	Importantly	,	bone	cell	activity	was	inversely	correlated	to	tumor_cell	oxidation	-	reduction_process_activity	(	measured	as	AR	,	FOXA1	,	HOXB13	,	KLK2	,	KLK3	,	NKX3	-	1	,	STEAP2	,	and	TMPRSS2	expression	)	and	to	patient	serum	prostate	-	specific	antigen	(	PSA	)	levels	.	.
s896	By	comparing	the	clinical	and	genetic	features	of	our	patients	with	those	previously	reported	,	we	show	that	the	severity	of	the	neurological	phenotype	and	the	frequency	of	congenital_heart_defects_characterize	the	deletions	that	,	besides	ANKRD11	,	contain	ZFPM1	,	CDH15	and	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_as	well	.	.
s1236	Integration	of	the	differentially	expressed	protein_polyubiquitinationNAs	with	matched	mRNA	expression	profiles	identified	highly	anti	-	correlated	,	putative	targets	,	which	were	significantly	enriched	in	cancer	-	associated	pathways	,	including	phosphatidylinositol	(	PI	)	)	,	mitogen	-	activated	protein	kinase	(	MAPK	)	,	and	B	-	cell	receptor	(	BCR	)	signaling	.	.
s893	By	comparing	the	clinical	and	genetic	features	of	our	patients	with	those	previously	reported	,	we	show	that	the	severity	of	the	neurological	phenotype	and	the	frequency	of	congenital_heart_defects_characterize	the	deletions	that	,	besides	odontogenesis_of_dentin	-	containing_tooth	,	contain	ZFPM1	,	CDH15	and	ZNF778	as	well	.	.
s991	RT	-	PCR	analysis	showed	that	the	overall	transcriptional	activity	of	the	main	HS	biosynthesis	-	involved	genes	(	EXT1	,	EXT2	,	NDST1	,	NDST2	,	GLCE	,	HS2ST1	,	HS3ST1	,	HS3ST2	,	HS6ST1	,	HS6ST2	,	SULF1	,	SULF2	,	cell	-	matrix_adhesion	)	was	decreased	by	1.5	-	2-fold	in	Grade	II	-	III	glioma	(	p	AAAA	0.01	)	and	by	3-fold	in	Grade	IV	glioma	(	glioblastoma	multiforme	,	GBM	)	(	p	AAAA	0.05	)	,	as	compared	with	the	para	-	tumourous	tissue	.	.
s1659	Immunostaining	showed	that	the	colon	cancer_was	positive	for	CDX2	,	SATB2	,	had	a	loss	of	PMS2	and	intact	expression	of	MLH1	,	MSH2	and	DNA_repair	,	negative	for	AMACR	,	while	the	prostate	cancer	was	positive	for	AMACR	,	had	intact	expression	of	PMS2	,	MLH1	,	MSH2	and	MSH6	,	and	negative	for	CDX2	and	SATB2	.	.
s848	Metabolic	cutis	laxa	results	from	Menkes	syndrome	,	caused	by	a	defect	in	the	ATPase	copper	transporting	alpha	(	ATP7A	)	gene	,	congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	due	to	mutations	in	subunit	7	of	the	component	of	oligomeric	Golgi	(	COG7)-congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	(	CDG	)	complex	,	combined	disorder	of	N-	and	O	-	linked	glycosylation	,	due	to	mutations	in	ATPase	H+	transporting	V0	subunit	a2	(	ATP6VOA2	)	gene	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	reductase	1	deficiency	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	synthase	deficiency	,	macrocephaly	,	alopecia	,	cutis	laxa	,	and	scoliosis	(	MACS	)	syndrome	,	due	to	Ras	and	Rab	interactor	2	(	RIN2	)	mutations	,	transaldolase	deficiency	caused	by	mutations	in	the	transaldolase	1	(	pentose	-	phosphate_shunt,_non	-	oxidative_branch	)	gene	,	Gerodermia	osteodysplastica	due	to	mutations	in	the	golgin	,	RAB6-interacting	(	GORAB	or	SCYL1BP1	)	gene	,	and	mitogen	-	activated	pathway	(	MAP	)	kinase	defects	,	caused	by	mutations	in	several	genes	[	protein	tyrosine	phosphatase	,	non	-	receptor	-	type	11	(	PTPN11	)	,	RAF	,	NF	,	HRas	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	HRAS	)	,	B	-	Raf	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	BRAF	)	,	MEK1/2	,	KRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	KRAS	)	,	SOS	Ras	/	Rho	guanine	nucleotide	exchange	factor	2	(	SOS2	)	,	leucine	rich	repeat	scaffold	protein	(	SHOC2	)	,	NRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	NRAS	)	,	and	Raf-1	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	RAF1	)	]	,	which	regulate	the	Ras	-	MAPK	cascade	.	.
s3462	Gene	set	enrichment	analysis	was	conducted	to	study	the	relevant	mechanisms	.	Bladder	cancer_patients	in	COL5A2	low	expression	group	were	associated	with	better	invasiveness	(	P	AAAA	.0001	)	,	tumor	grade	(	P	=	.001	)	,	T	staging	(	P	AAAA	.0001	)	,	N	staging	(	P	=	.002	)	,	cancer	specific	survival	(	P	AAAA	.0001	)	,	overall	survival	(	P	AAAA	.0001	)	,	and	a	trend	of	better	M	staging	(	P	=	.053	)	than	those	in	COL5A2	high	expression	group	.

s2870	Post	-	infectious	glomerulonephritis_(GPI_anchor_biosynthetic_process	)	is	one	of	the	most	common	causes	of	acute	glomerulonephritis	in	children	.	.
s213	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal	recessive	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy_(SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/bile_acid_metabolic_process	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s104	We	validated	ZBTB20	,	CELF2	,	protein_targeting_to_membrane	,	AKAP13	and	WAC	,	which	were	identified	by	our	screens	in	multiple	cancer_types	,	as	new	tumor	suppressor	genes	in	prostate	cancer	.	.
s1953	The	tumor	-	cell	activated	phenotype	of	EPC	was	associated	with	increased	migration	and	elevated	expression	of	ephrin	-	B2	,	and	Delta	-	like	4	ligand	(	positive_regulation_of_gene_expression	)	.	.
s1226	The	aim	of	this	work	is	to	provide	supplementary	information	about	cholesterol_biosynthetic_process_variability	useful	in	the	molecular	diagnosis	of	MKD	,	as	well	as	to	unravel	the	presence	of	novel	genes	potentially	involved	as	involved	in	the	clinical	heterogeneity_of	MKD	phenotype	.	.
s1734	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	desmosome_assembly	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s1444	By	using	quantitative	(	real	-	time	)	PCR	,	western	blot	analysis	,	and	immunocytochemical	staining	,	three	non	-	small	cell	lung	cancer_(NSCLC	)	cell	lines	(	A427	,	A549	and	NCI	-	H358	)	were	analyzed	for	the	expression	of	EpoR	and	its	specific	downstream	signaling	pathways	[	Janus	kinase	2	(	Jak2)-signal	transducer	and	activator	of	transcription	5	(	STAT5	)	,	phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase	(	PI3K)-positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	,	mitogen	-	activated	protein	(	MAP	)	kinase	]	.	.
s1421	Higher	expression	of	positive_regulation_of_lipid_kinase_activity	,	EEF1B2	,	EEF1	G	,	EEF1D	,	EEF1E1	and	EEF2	was	observed	in	most	of	the	cancer_types	,	whereas	reverse	trend	was	observed	for	EEF1A1	.	.
s2986	WTX	/	positive_regulation_of_protein_ubiquitination_is	an	important	developmental	regulator	,	mutations	in	which	have	been	identified	in	a	proportion	of	patients	suffering	from	the	renal_neoplasm_Wilms	_	tumor	and	in	the	bone	malformation	syndrome	Osteopathia	Striata	with	Cranial	Sclerosis	(	OSCS	)	.	.
s1825	Here	,	the	homozygous	anatomical_structure_morphogenesis-/-	rabbits	showed	complete	loss	of	hair	on	the	head	and	dorsum	,	whereas	hypotrichosis_in	the	limbs	and	tail	were	determined	in	the	Hoxc13-/-	rabbits	.	.
s248	Finally	,	by	immunohistochemical	staining	of	primary	breast	tissue	microarrays	we	find	that	DNA_repair	/	KDM5A	/	SIN3B	complex	subunits	are	frequently	overexpressed	in	primary	breast	cancer_cases	in	a	correlative	manner	.	.
s1453	Somatic	mutations	in	four	genes	(	KCNJ5	,	ATP1A1	,	ATP2B3	and	calcium_ion_transport	)	,	differently	implicated	in	intracellular	ion	homeostasis	,	have	been	identified	in	nearly	60	%	of	the	sporadic_APAs	.	.
s1197	In	particular	,	MYH9	mutations	result	in	congenital	macrothrombocytopenia_and	predispose	to	kidney	failure	,	hearing	loss	,	and	cataracts	,	MPL	and	MECOM	mutations	cause	congenital	thrombocytopenia	evolving	into	bone	marrow	failure	,	whereas	thrombocytopenias	caused	by	RUNX1	,	negative_regulation_of_fat_cell_differentiation	,	and	ETV6	mutations	are	characterized	by	predisposition	to	hematological	malignancies	.	.
s1931	Our	results	showed	that	treatment	with	MEHP	enriched	the	population	of	cancer	-	stem	-	cell	(	CSC)-like	cells	and	upregulated	IL-8	expression	by	inducing	the	AKT	-	b	-	catenin	-	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_signaling	pathway	.	.
s1684	hyaluronan_catabolic_process_was	expressed	on	the	surface	of	poorly	differentiated	tumour_cells	,	and	within	the	The	Cancer	Genome	Atlas	-	Head	and	Neck	Squamous	Cell	Carcinoma	samples	,	its	messenger	RNA	levels	were	higher	in	tumours	compared	to	normal	.	.
s4035	To	gain	insight	into	the	molecular	basis	of	the	heterogeneous_phenotype	observed	in	men	with	the	deletion	we	defined	the	type	of	DAZ	and	spermatogenesis_genes	deleted	.	.
s1458	Pre	-	citrate_transport_core	needle	biopsies	and	postoperative	tumor_samples	were	immunohistochemically	stained	for	nuclear	factor	erythroid	2-related	factor	2	(	Nrf2	)	,	Kelch	-	like	ECH	-	associated	protein	1	(	Keap1	)	,	thioredoxin	(	Trx	)	,	and	peroxiredoxin	I	(	Prx	I	)	.	.
s2871	Although	post	-	streptococcal	glomerulonephritis_(PSGN	)	is	still	common	,	there	is	a	wide	spectrum	of	causative	agents	of	GPI_anchor_biosynthetic_process	.	.

s789	Many	cancer_cell	lines	derived	from	hematopoietic	and	lymphoid	lineages	are	sensitive	to	indisulam	,	and	their	sensitivity	correlates	with	protein_ubiquitination_expression	levels	.	.
s3585	The	canonical	Hippo	tumor_suppressor	pathway	in	mammalian	cells	is	primarily	composed	of	the	MST1/2-SAV1-LATS1/2-MOB1-YAP	/	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_cascade	.	.
s2296	Mutations	in	protein_phosphorylation	,	BMPR2	,	or	ENG	are	associated	with	hereditary	hemorrhagic	telangiectasia	and	pulmonary_arterial_hypertension_in	humans	[	1	,	2	]	.	.
s1113	We	expand	the	knowledge	about	protein_localization_to_plasma_membrane_deficiency	,	describing	a	patient	with	the	mild	phenotype	of	TTC7A	deficiency	but	presenting	overlapping	features	of	SD	/	THE	and	MIA	-	CID	,	intestinal_atresia_and	inflammatory	bowel	disease	evocative	of	MIA	-	CID	,	but	also	dental	abnormalities	,	huge	forehead	,	liver	abnormalities	,	autoimmune	thyroiditis	and	hypogammaglobulinemia	,	evocative	of	SD	/	THE	.
s3018	Patients	also	present	a	variable	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_of	poorly	explained	additional	clinical	features	,	including	ichthyosis	,	impaired	intelligence	,	developmental_delay_and	anemia	.	.
s3224	Lentivirus	-	mediated	knockdown	of	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_represses	in	vitro	proliferation	and	colony	formation	and	in	vivo	growth	of	breast	cancer_cells	,	whereas	STX3	overexpression	promotes	the	growth	of	breast	cancer	cells	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	.	.
s484	In	this	study	,	we	report	a	family	with	X	-	linked	recessive	syndrome	caused	by	mutated	biological_process_and	characterized	by	elliptocytosis_with	or	without	anemia	,	midface	hypoplasia	,	proportionate	short	stature	and	hearing	loss	.	.
s1468	These	changes	were	accompanied	by	cortical_atrophy_as	well	as	increased	expression	of	angiogenesis	-	related	genes	such	as	Vegfa	,	Serpine1	,	and	Plau	in	phagocytosis	-	positive	endothelial	cells	.	.
s3037	Results	on	CcO	composition	in	tissues	from	adult	animals	and	the	review	of	data	from	recent	literature	strongly	suggest	that	mitochondrial_electron_transport,_NADH_to_ubiquinone_is	not	a	14th	subunit	of	CcO	but	may	represent	an	assembly	factor	for	CcO	or	supercomplexes	(	respirasomes	)	in	mitochondria	of	growing	cells	and	cancer_tissues	.
s2814	We	also	emphasized	that	the	ERK	and	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_signaling	pathways	were	the	mechanisms	underlying	the	inhibitory	effect	of	HCRP1	on	glioma_cells	.	.
s290	The	expression	levels	of	the	up	-	regulated	genes	(	regulation_of_translational_initiation	,	BBS1	and	PH-4	)	were	also	found	to	be	correlated	to	epithelial	to	mesenchymal	transition	status	of	the	tumour	.	.
s3843	A	founder	mutation	in	positive_regulation_of_GTPase_activity_(KIAA1432	)	was	identified	in	patients	with	cataract	,	brain	atrophy	,	microcephaly	with	or	without	cleft_lip_and	palate	.	.
s3472	Overall	,	our	findings	identify	camera	-	type_eye_development_as	a	potential	therapeutic	target	for	modulating	ocular	growth	aimed	at	preventing	or	slowing	down	myopia	,	which	is	reaching	epidemic	proportions	.
s1794	As	the	first	identified	messenger	RNA	N6-methyladenosine	(	cellular_response_to_DNA_damage_stimulus	)	demethylase	,	FTO	has	been	shown	recently	to	play	m6A	-	dependent	roles	in	adipogenesis	and	tumorigenesis	(	especially	in	the	development	of	leukemia	and	glioblastoma	)	.	.
s2286	From	a	GeneMatcher	-	enabled	international	collaboration	,	we	identified	ten	individuals	affected	by	intellectual_disability	,	speech	delay	,	ataxia	,	and	facial	dysmorphism	and	carrying	a	deleterious	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_variant	detected	by	whole	-	exome	sequencing	.	.
s2400	Here	we	describe	4	families	with	autosomal	recessive	inherited	macrothrombocytopenia_with	focal	myelofibrosis	due	to	germ	line	loss	-	of	-	function	mutations	in	the	megakaryocyte	-	specific	immunoreceptor	tyrosine	-	based	inhibitory	motif	(	ITIM)-containing	receptor	G6b	-	B	(	G6b	,	C6orf25	,	or	negative_regulation_of_signal_transduction	)	.	.
s3270	The	Kinesin	family	member	2a	(	mitotic_spindle_organization	)	,	that	belongs	to	the	Kinesin-13	microtubule	depolymerases	,	plays	an	important	role	in	cancer_cell	proliferation	,	migration	and	apoptosis	in	various	types	of	cancer	such	as	gastric	cancer	,	breast	cancer	,	and	squamous	cell	carcinoma	of	the	oral	tongue	,	but	,	its	role	and	mechanism	in	lung	adenocarcinoma	(	LUAD	)	is	largely	unknown	.	.
s1716	MED1	mediates	induction	of	cell	proliferation	and	migration	and	the	genes	associated	with	it	(	transforming_growth_factor_beta_receptor_signaling_pathway	,	FOS	,	EGFR	,	VEGF	,	MMP1	,	and	ERBB4	)	in	breast	cancer	,	which	is	abrogated	when	used	together	with	miR-191-inhibition	.	.
s3536	Mechanistic	studies	showed	that	intrinsic_apoptotic_signaling_pathway_in_response_to_oxidative_stress_can	inhibit	the	expression	of	Survivin	,	promote	cell	apoptosis	of	drug	-	resistant	ovarian	cancer_cells	and	reverse	the	drug	resistance	.
s2178	This	result	suggests	that	activation_of_cysteine	-	type_endopeptidase_activity_involved_in_apoptotic_process_and	COL4A4	digenic	mutations	in	cis	mimicking	an	autosomal	dominant	inheritance_should	be	considered	as	a	novel	inheritance	pattern	of	benign	familial	hematuria	,	although	the	disease	-	causing	mechanism	remains	unknown	.
s241	We	show	that	the	meiosis	-	related	EECTG	(	resolution_of_meiotic_recombination_intermediates	)	and	its	nearby	CT	-	ncRNA	have	a	role	in	tumorigenesis	in	lung_adenocarcinoma	.	.
s1557	Among	those	with	peripheral	tumors	,	the	median	tumor	number	was	4	in	the	LZTR1	group	(	median	total	body	tumor	volume	30	cc	)	and	10	in	the	nucleosome_disassembly_group	(	median	volume	85cc	)	,	(	P=.2915	for	tumor	number	and	P	=	.2289	for	volume	)	.	.
s2124	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s38	Our	results	indicate	that	sensory_perception_of_sound_should	be	considered	in	differential	genetic	diagnosis	for	individuals	with	early	onset	,	moderate	-	to	-	severe	and	progressive_hearing	loss	.	.
s2540	Although	univariate	analysis	showed	that	tumor_size	(	P	=	.012	)	,	grade	(	Z	=	-2.114	,	P	=	.034	)	,	and	peritumoral	enhancement	(	x	=	4.464	,	P	=	.035	)	were	associated	with	MVI	,	multiple	logistic	regression	analysis	showed	that	capsular	invasion	(	odds	ratio	[	OR	]	=	23.469	,	P	AAAA	.001	)	,	margins	(	OR	=	6.751	,	P	AAAA	.001	)	,	and	serum	post	-	translational_protein_modification_level	(	OR	=	1.001	,	P	=	.038	)	were	associated	with	MVI	in	HCC	(	P	AAAA	.05	)	.	.
s3082	The	reported	hypertrophic	cardiomyopathy_relevant	genes	MYPN	,	regulation_of_the_force_of_heart_contraction_and	MYBP3	had	also	been	found	in	case	1	and	2	.	.
s35	Exome	sequencing	revealed	an	insertion	mutation	in	sensory_perception_of_sound_as	the	cause	of	moderate	-	to	-	severe	and	likely	progressive_hearing	loss	in	the	affected	individuals	of	the	family	.	.
s3159	We	report	here	two	new	nonsense	mutations	(	pGln12	_	and	pTyr110	)	in	positive_regulation_of_cytosolic_calcium_ion_concentration_patients	displaying	nonsyndromic	profound_hearing	loss	,	with	no	evidence	of	vestibular	or	retinal	dysfunction	.	.
s3420	Functional	assays	indicate	that	negative_regulation_of_cell	-	cell_adhesion_reactivation	ameliorates	the	malignant	phenotype	,	specifically	reducing	cell	viability	,	migration	and	invasion	in	diverse	cancer_cell	lines	.	.
s2829	We	detected	11	novel	mutations	in	GJA3	,	GJA8	,	CRYAA	,	CRYBB2	,	CRYGS	,	visual_perception	,	GCNT2	,	CRYGA	,	and	MIP	,	and	three	previously	reported	cataract	-	causing	mutations	in	GJA8	,	CRYAA	,	and	CRYBB2	The	most	commonly	mutated	genes	were	those	coding	for	gap	junctions	and	crystallin	proteins	.	.
s3282	Furthermore	,	these	in	vitro	findings	were	validated	in	vivo	and	the	ERK1/2	and	PI3k	/	AKT	signaling	pathways	were	involved	in	fat_cell_differentiation	-	triggered	migration	and	proliferation	of	glioma_cells	.	.
s2156	apoptotic_process_was	significantly	up	-	regulated	in	HCC	tissues	and	cell	lines	,	and	correlated	with	AFP	,	poor	tumor_histology	and	T	stage	.	.
s1481	Missense	mutations	that	disrupt	the	RING	domain	of	the	tumor_suppressor	gene	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination_lead	to	increased	risk	of	breast	and	ovarian	cancer	.	.
s2440	ETV1/4/5	factors	are	often	overexpressed	in	prostate	cancer_and	genome	-	wide	studies	in	a	prostate	cancer	cell	line	indicate	that	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_and	MED25	occupy	enhancers	that	are	enriched	for	ETS	-	binding	sequences	and	are	both	functionally	important	for	the	transcription	of	genes	regulated	by	these	enhancers	.	.
s3806	Moreover	,	we	show	that	over	-	expression	of	prostaglandin_biosynthetic_process_dramatically	decreases	hepatic	steatosis_through	increased	autophagy	in	hepatocytes	of	HFD	-	fed	mice	.	.
s2288	From	a	GeneMatcher	-	enabled	international	collaboration	,	we	identified	ten	individuals	affected	by	intellectual	disability	,	speech	delay	,	ataxia	,	and	facial_dysmorphism_and	carrying	a	deleterious	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_variant	detected	by	whole	-	exome	sequencing	.	.
s1239	We	found	a	significant	association	between	ubiquitin	-	dependent_protein_catabolic_process_rs9404576	polymorphism	and	decreased	Wilms	_	tumor_risk	.	.
s3142	At	the	suggestive	threshold	(	P	AAAA	.001	)	,	6	genes	were	enriched	for	rare	damaging	variants	(	UHMK1	,	AP1G2	,	DNTA	,	N	-	acetylglucosamine_metabolic_process	,	FGFR3	,	and	EPHA1	)	and	7	genes	had	associations	with	pancreatic	cancer_risk	,	based	on	the	sequence	-	kernel	association	test	.	.
s1625	Furthermore	,	since	adipocytes	provide	the	largest	storage	depot	for	thyroid_gland_development_and	play	a	crucial	role	in	the	development	of	obesity	,	we	could	infer	that	apoA5	also	acts	as	a	novel	regulator	to	modulate	TG	storage	in	adipocytes	.	.
s3597	ion_transmembrane_transport-3	potassium	channels	are	believed	to	promote	proliferation	and	survival	of	cancer_cells	,	in	part	,	by	augmenting	their	resistance	to	both	hypoxia	and	serum	deprivation	.	.
s2227	We	previously	demonstrated	that	phospho	-	mTOR	expression	is	associated	with	tumor	aggressiveness	,	therapy	resistance	,	and	lower	mRNA	expression	of	SLC5A5	in	papillary	thyroid	carcinoma	(	PTC	)	,	while	phospho	-	positive_regulation_of_RNA_polymerase_II_transcriptional_preinitiation_complex_assembly_(mTORC1	effector	)	expression	was	associated	with	less	aggressive	clinicopathological	features	.	.
s4076	She	manifested	macrocephaly	,	preaxial	polysyndactyly	,	psychomotor	developmental	delay	,	cerebral	cavernous	malformations	,	and	glucose	intolerance	due	to	a	6.2-Mb	deletion	of	7p14.1p12.3	which	included	GLI3	,	protein_phosphorylation	,	and	CCM2	.	.
s693	We	show	that	morpholino	-	mediated	negative_regulation_of_protein_kinase_activity_loss	of	function	in	the	zebrafish	results	in	shortened	body	axis	,	microphthalmia	with	disorganized	lens	,	microcephaly	,	reduced	touch	-	evoked	motility	,	and	highly	disorganized	myofibers	.	.
s2444	We	demonstrated	that	linc	-	ADAL	interacts	with	heterogeneous_nuclear	ribonucleoprotein	U	(	hnRNPU	)	and	insulin	-	like	growth	factor	2	mRNA	binding	protein	2	(	negative_regulation_of_translation	)	at	distinct	subcellular	locations	to	regulate	adipocyte	differentiation	and	lipogenesis	.
s2358	Conclusions	,	Two	stable	multidrug	resistant	cell	lines	of	pancreatic	cancer	,	JF305/CDDP	and	PANC-1/negative_regulation_of_DNA_replication	,	were	successfully	established	.	.
s3262	However	,	in	HaCaT	and	HEK293	T	cells	that	display	transformed	phenotypes	,	but	do	not	originate	from	patient	-	derived	tumors	,	the	ER	stress	-	inducing	treatments	resulted	in	an	upregulation	of	FAM129A	and	HKDC1	,	but	not	KRT16	transcripts	,	By	a	luciferase	reporter	approach	we	identified	a	highly	active	response_to_endoplasmic_reticulum_stress	-	responsive	element	within	the	upstream	region	of	the	KRT16	gene	.	.
s707	We	report	a	sibling	pair	with	FTHS	caused	by	a	homozygous	,	novel	mutation	pLys133Glnfs	13	in	the	superoxide_metabolic_process_gene	,	one	sibling	had	bilateral_ocular	hypertension	and	unilateral	colobomas	of	iris	,	choroid	and	retina	,	the	other	,	unilateral	myelinated	nerve	fiber	layer	of	the	optic	disk	and	papilledema	due	to	idiopathic	intracranial	hypertension	.	.
s2692	We	sequenced	GATM	,	creatine_biosynthetic_process_and	SLC6A8	genes	in	166	patients	with	autism_(coding	sequence	,	introns	and	adjacent	untranslated	regions	)	.	.
s480	By	contrast	,	loss	of	sensory_perception_of_sound_in	adult	OHCs	causes	a	slowly	progressive	hearing_loss_associated	with	OHC	degeneration	and	delayed	loss	of	inner	hair	cells	(	IHCs	)	,	indicating	a	primary	role	for	pejvakin	in	regulating	OHC	function	and	survival	.	.
s1372	Ellis	-	glycoprotein_biosynthetic_process_Creveld	syndrome	is	an	autosomal	recessive	skeletal	dysplasia	primarily	characterized	by	the	features	such	as	disproportionate	dwarfism	,	short	ribs	,	short	limbs	,	dysplastic	nails	,	cardiovascular	malformations	,	post	-	axial	polydactyly_(PAP	)	(	bilateral	)	of	hands	and	feet	.	.
s3665	In	the	PPI	network	,	2	clusters	of	VTE	genes	,	including	ribosomal	protein	family	genes	and	NADH	family	-	ubiquinol	-	cytochrome	genes	,	were	identified	,	such	as	ribosomal	protein	L9	(	cytoplasmic_translation	)	,	RPL5	,	RPS20	,	RPL23	,	and	tumor_protein	p53	(	TP53).The	nod	-	like	receptor	signaling	pathway	,	ribosomal	protein	family	genes	,	such	as	RPL9	,	RPL5	,	RPS20	,	and	RPL23	,	and	DEG	of	TP53	may	have	the	potential	to	be	used	as	targets	for	diagnosis	and	treatment	of	VTE	.
s3308	In	this	study	,	we	evaluated	the	effect	of	regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_inactivation	on	biologic	behavior	of	primary	(	Caco-2	)	and	metastatic	colon	cancer	cells	(	LoVo	and	SNU407	)	and	the	relation	of	p	-	STAT3	expression	with	the	invasion	of	colon	tumor	.	.
s3869	Here	,	we	describe	three	individuals	who	are	affected	by	global	developmental_delay	,	intellectual	disability	,	and	expressive	speech	disorder	and	carry	de	novo	variants	in	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	.	.
s1999	We	documented	17	malignancies	,	which	amounts	to	a	cancer_prevalence	of	12.9	%	in	affected	negative_regulation_of_regulatory_T_cell_differentiation_mutation	carriers	.	.
s4066	In	human	breast	cancer_xenografts	in	humanized	mice	,	blocking	the	recruitment	of	naive	CD4	+	T	cells	into	tumor	by	knocking	down	the	expression	of	ER_to_Golgi_vesicle	-	mediated_transport	,	a	CCL18	receptor	,	significantly	reduces	intratumoral	Tregs	and	inhibits	tumor	progression	.	.
s2070	Objective	,	To	investigate	the	expression	of	succinate	dehydrogenase	complex	subunit	protein	in	succinate	dehydrogenase	-	deficient	gastrointestinal	stromal	tumors	(	sarcosine_catabolic_process	-	deficient	GISTs	)	.	.
s573	programmed_cell_death2	deletion	accelerated	tumor	formation	in	medulloblastoma	-	prone	ND2,SmoA1	mice	,	indicating	the	disrupting	PKM	releases	CGNPs	from	a	tumor	-	suppressive	effect	.	.
s3085	Codeletion	of	Adrb2	and	heme_a_biosynthetic_process	,	a	gene	encoding	a	cytochrome	IV	oxidase	assembly	factor	,	prevented	the	metabolic	shift	induced	by	Adrb2	deletion	and	rescued	prostate	cancer_progression	.	.
s2518	Extensive	search	of	the	literature	revealed	a	potential	key	role	of	genes	at	the	identified	porcine	loci	in	tumor_invasion	(	DST	,	PLEKHA5	,	CBY1	,	LIMK2	and	ETV5	)	and	immune	response	modulation	(	ETV5	,	protein_ubiquitination_and	DICER1	)	of	the	progression	phenotypes	.	.
s21	Interestingly	,	FIGNL1	is	recruited	to	sites	of	DNA	damage	in	a	manner	that	is	independent	of	breast	cancer_2	,	early	onset	,	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination	,	and	probably	,	RAD51	paralogs	.	.
s1736	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	cilium_assembly	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s2994	The	anti	-	protein_polyubiquitination-663	reduced	OXPHOS	complex	activity	and	increased	in	vitro	cellular	proliferation	and	promoted	tumor_development	in	vivo	in	mice	.	.
s559	Recent	GWAS	completed	for	three	types	of	common	adult	-	onset	glaucoma_have	identified	novel	loci	for	POAG	(	primary	-	open	-	angle	glaucoma	)	(	ABCA1	,	AFAP1	,	GMDS	,	PMM2	,	TGFBR3	,	FNDC3B	,	ARHGEF12	,	GAS7	,	FOXC1	,	ATXN2	,	TXNRD2	)	,	PACG	(	primary	angle	-	closure	glaucoma	(	cell	-	matrix_adhesion	,	CHAT	,	GLIS3	,	FERMT2	,	DPM2-FAM102	)	,	and	exfoliation	syndrome	(	XFS	)	glaucoma	(	CACNA1A	)	.	.
s1432	Overexpression	of	many	factors	predicted	poor	prognosis	in	breast	(	EEF1D	,	EEF1E1	,	positive_regulation_of_translation	)	and	lung	cancer_(EEF1A2	,	EEF1B2	,	EEF1	G	,	EEF1E1	)	.	.
s3872	Our	findings	indicate	that	mutations	in	EBF3	cause	a	genetic	neurodevelopmental	syndrome	and	suggest	that	loss	of	EBF3	function	might	mediate	a	subset	of	neurologic	phenotypes	shared	by	protein_sumoylation	-	related	disorders	,	including	intellectual_disability	,	abnormal	genitalia	,	and	structural	CNS	malformations	.
s2913	Several	putative	genes	associated	with	hallmarks	of	malignancy	that	may	have	an	important	role	in	predicting	the	progression	of	leukoplakia	and	erythroleukoplakia	to	squamous_cell_carcinoma	,	namely	gains	in	BNIPL	,	MCL1	,	STAG2	,	positive_regulation_of_cytokinesis_and	ZNRF3	genes	were	also	identified	.
s1457	In	total	,	53	women	with	primarily	inoperable	or	inflammatory	breast	cancer_who	were	treated	with	citrate_transport_were	included	in	the	study	.	.
s1730	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	positive_regulation_of_interleukin-12_biosynthetic_process	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s481	In	this	study	,	we	report	a	family	with	X	-	linked	recessive	syndrome	caused	by	mutated	biological_process_and	characterized	by	elliptocytosis	with	or	without	anemia	,	midface_hypoplasia	,	proportionate	short	stature	and	hearing	loss	.	.
s11	Furthermore	,	we	demonstrated	that	in	three	different	experimental	models	characterised	by	an	upregulation	of	rRNA	synthesis	,	cancer_cells	treated	with	insulin	or	exposed	to	the	insulin	-	like	growth	factor	1	,	rat	liver	stimulated	by	cortisol	and	regenerating	rat	liver	after	partial	hepatectomy	,	the	DNA_strand_renaturation_protein	level	was	reduced	due	to	a	lowered	ribosomal	protein	availability	for	MDM2	binding	.	.
s2032	Disrupting	the	CBX3-fructose_6-phosphate_metabolic_process_signaling	axis	would	be	effective	to	treat	pancreatic	cancer_and	prevent	aerobic	glycolysis	.

s520	To	date	variants	in	four	genes	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	ZNF141	,	MIPOL1	and	PITX1	have	been	implicated	in	developing	non	-	syndromic	form	of	polydactyly	.	.
s2951	Loss	-	of	-	function	mutations	in	MTM1	cause	the	severe	congenital	myopathy	called	myotubular	myopathy	(	or	X	-	linked	centronuclear	myopathy	)	while	mutations	in	the	MTM1-related	protein	phosphatidylinositol_dephosphorylation_cause	a	recessive	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	peripheral	neuropathy	.	.
s2219	Atypical	Rett	syndrome	is	a	child	neurodevelopmental	disorder	induced	by	mutations	in	regulation_of_postsynapse_organization_gene	and	characterized	by	a	progressive	regression	in	development	with	loss	of	purposeful	use	of	the	hands	,	slowed	brain	and	head	growth	,	problems	with	walking	,	seizures	,	and	intellectual	disability	.	.

s3657	Western	blot	analysis	,	real	-	time	PCR	,	MTT	assay	and	flow	cytometric	analysis	were	performed	and	the	results	demonstrated	that	compared	with	the	gastric	cancer_SGC-7901	cells	,	the	expression	of	NIBP	,	NF	-	kB	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	NF	-	kB	p	-	p65	and	mesenchymal	marker	vimentin	were	significantly	increased	in	gastric	cancer	multidrug	-	resistant	SGC-7901/CDDP	cells	,	and	the	epithelial	cell	marker	ZO-1	was	significantly	decreased	.	.
s1539	Here	,	we	show	that	deletion	of	Arl13b	reduced	Shh	signaling	levels	in	the	presence	of	oncogenic	polyamine_catabolic_processA1	,	suggesting	Arl13b	acts	downstream	of	known	tumor_resistance	mechanisms	.	.
s2345	We	present	detailed	clinical	assessment	and	functional	studies	on	a	de	novo	variant	in	a	female	with	an	epileptic	encephalopathy_and	discuss	an	additional	four	families	with	rare	variants	in	mRNA_export_from_nucleus_with	supportive	evidence	for	pathogenicity	.	.

s2290	Our	findings	demonstrate	that	variants	disrupting	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	-	mediated	transcriptional	regulation	cause	intellectual	disability	and	developmental_delay_and	are	present	in	a0.1	%	of	individuals	with	unexplained	neurodevelopmental	disorders	.
s2858	Almost	all	gonadoblastomas	occur	in	patients	who	have	a	Y	chromosome	or	part	thereof	,	testis	-	specific	protein	Y	-	encoded	1	(	sex_differentiation	)	is	the	putative	gene	.	.
s1180	CCBE1	and	cell	-	matrix_adhesion_expression	was	assessed	in	samples	from	normal	and	tumor_tissue	using	polymerase	chain	reaction	,	western	blot	analysis	and	immunohistochemistry	.	.
s3292	In	the	present	study	,	we	demonstrated	that	CDKN1C	was	dramatically	downregulated	in	breast	cancer_compared	with	normal	tissues	by	using	real	-	time	quantitative	polymerase	chain	reaction	,	western	blot	and	two	public	data	portals	,	The	Cancer	Genome	Atlas	(	TCGA	)	and	Oncomine	datanegative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templateds	.	.
s447	There	was	a	statistically	significant	difference	in	Ras_protein_signal_transduction_gene	methylation	between	SMARCB1/INI1-deficient	and	SMARCB1/INI1-positive	tumors	(	p=0.0095	)	.	.
s1778	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	biological_process	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s418	In	this	study	,	we	found	that	photoreceptor_cell_maintenance_mRNA	expression	was	a	prognostic	marker	in	three	independent	glioma_patient	cohorts	,	corroborating	a	putative	role	for	CD133	in	glioma	progression	.	.
s1322	Fourteen	different	(	half	of	them	novel	)	non	-	GJB2	variants	causing	HL	were	found	in	10	genes	(	CHD7	,	HDAC8	,	MITF	,	NEFL	,	OTOF	,	SF3B4	,	SLC26A4	,	cell	-	matrix_adhesion	,	TMPRSS3	,	USH2A	)	among	13	probands	,	confirming	the	genetic	heterogeneity_of	hereditary	HL	.	.
s1704	Lately	,	biological_process_was	linked	to	the	cyclic	AMP	signaling	pathway	,	which	could	be	implicated	in	all	of	mechanisms	of	cortisol	-	secreting	by	macronodules	adrenal_hyperplasia_and	the	molecular	defects	in	,	G	protein	aberrant	receptors	,	MC2R	,	GNAS	,	PRKAR1A	,	PDE11A	,	PDE8B.	.
s3984	cytoskeletal_anchoring_at_plasma_membrane	-	related	disorders	are	classified	as	spondylocarpotarsal	synostosis	(	SCT	)	,	Larsen	syndrome	(	LS	)	,	atelosteogenesis	(	AO	)	,	boomerang	dysplasia	(	BD	)	,	and	isolated	congenital	talipes	equinovarus	,	presenting	with	scoliosis	,	short	-	limbed	dwarfism	,	clubfoot	,	joint	dislocation	and	other	unique	skeletal_abnormalities	.	.
s3561	Eight	of	the	genes	,	APC	,	TP53	,	ATM	,	CSMD3	,	receptor	-	mediated_endocytosis	,	RYR2	,	BIRC6	,	and	MUC17	,	contained	mutations	in	AAAA20	%	of	the	carcinomas	.	.
s1897	Heterozygous	de	novo	sodium_ion_transmembrane_transport_missense	variants	in	the	S5/S6	pore	-	forming	segments	lead	to	congenital	contractures	of	the	limbs	and	face	,	hypotonia	,	and	developmental_delay_(CLIFAHDD	,	OMIM	616266	)	with	some	clinical	overlap	.	.

s322	Inhibition	of	protein_secretion_action	may	result	in	the	alleviation	of	insulin	resistance	associated	with	obesity_and	diabetes	.
s3341	This	review	highlights	recent	advances	in	understanding	how	the	epidermal_cell_differentiation	-	OVOL2	axis	modulates	cell	differentiation	and	proliferation	in	human	keratinocytes	,	hair	follicles	,	and	benign	or	malignant	skin	tumors	including	squamous_cell_carcinoma_and	malignant	melanoma	.	.
s2555	Expectedly	,	the	analysis	of	the	DEGs	common	to	all	three	alterations	highlighted	a	group	of	BioFunctions	that	included	Cell	Proliferation	of	tumor_cell	lines	(	14	DEGs	)	,	Invasion	of	cells	(	10	DEGs	)	and	Migration	of	tumour	cell	lines	(	10	DEGs	)	,	with	a	common	core	of	5	genes	(	ATF3	,	G1/S_transition_of_mitotic_cell_cycle	,	GDF15	,	HBEGF	and	LCN2	)	that	likely	represent	downstream	effectors	of	the	pro	-	oncogenic	activities	of	PI3K	/	AKT	signalling	.	.
s2969	A	plethora	of	human	diseases	are	associated	with	mutations	in	the	genes	encoding	human	SLC26	transporters	,	including	chondrodysplasias	with	varying	severity	in	SLC26A2	(	~50	mutations	,	27	point	mutations	)	,	congenital	chloride	-	losing	diarrhea	in	SLC26A3	(	~70	mutations	,	31	point	mutations	)	and	Pendred	Syndrome	or	deafness	autosomal_recessive_type	4	in	regulation_of_pH_(~500	mutations	,	203	point	mutations	)	.	.
s601	The	purpose	of	this	review	is	to	present	a	comprehensive	picture	of	the	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_of	FTO	on	obesity_susceptibility	and	to	illuminate	these	new	studies	of	FTO	function	in	adipose	tissue	.
s629	In	addition	,	we	found	that	FOXC1	regulation	of	RAB3GAP1	,	RAB3GAP2	and	exocytosis_affects	secretion	of	Myocilin	(	MYOC	)	,	a	protein	associated	with	juvenile_onset_glaucoma	and	steroid	-	induced	glaucoma	.	.
s3399	In	the	pathway	analysis	,	targets	of	protein_polyubiquitination-23b-3p	were	primarily	enriched	in	the	signaling	pathways	of	renal	cell	carcinoma	,	hepatitis	B	and	pancreatic	cancer_(corrected	P	-	value	AAAA0.05	)	.	.
s3467	We	have	previously	identified	a	role	for	the	secreted	serine	protease	camera	-	type_eye_development_in	ocular	size	determination	and	PRSS56	variants	have	been	implicated	in	the	etiology	of	both	hyperopia_and	myopia	,	highlighting	its	importance	in	refractive	development	.	.

s181	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal_recessive_Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	protein_ubiquitination	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy	(	SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s1319	Fourteen	different	(	half	of	them	novel	)	non	-	GJB2	variants	causing	HL	were	found	in	10	genes	(	CHD7	,	HDAC8	,	positive_regulation_of_gene_expression	,	NEFL	,	OTOF	,	SF3B4	,	SLC26A4	,	TECTA	,	TMPRSS3	,	USH2A	)	among	13	probands	,	confirming	the	genetic	heterogeneity_of	hereditary	HL	.	.
s2772	In	human	plasma	,	osmotic	shock	increased	cT	-	tubule_organization_detection	by	enzyme	-	linked	immunosorbent	assay	(	ELISA	)	,	and	cBIN1	level	decreased	in	humans	with	heart_failure	,	a	condition	with	reduced	cardiac	muscle	cBIN1	,	both	of	which	support	cBIN1	release	in	MPs	from	human	hearts	.	.
s3825	We	find	that	lung	squamous	cell	carcinoma	(	SQCC	)	,	which	accounts	for	~20	%	of	lung	cancer	,	exhibits	increased	expression	of	the	PI3	K	subunit	phosphatidylinositol_3-kinase_signaling	,	which	is	at	low	expression	levels	in	normal	tissues	.	.
s2928	Al	-	Awadi	-	Raas	-	Rothschild	syndrome	(	AARRS	,	OMIM	276820	)	is	a	very	rare	autosomal_recessive_limb	malformation	syndrome	caused	by	regulation_of_presynapse_assembly_mutations	.	.
s763	We	here	review	the	current	knowledge	and	recent	findings	in	the	known	genes	for	isolated	dystonia_TOR1A	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	and	GNAL	as	well	as	for	the	combined	dystonias	due	to	mutations	in	GCH1	,	ATP1A3	,	and	SGCE	.	.
s652	IL17RD	expression	was	increased	in	ulcerative	colitis	cancers	,	and	miR-193a-3p	treatment	decreased	growth	and	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_signaling	of	HCT116	cells	in	xenografts	expressing	both	IL17RD	with	WT	3	UTR	compared	with	cells	expressing	IL17RD	with	mutant	3	UTR.Conclusions	,	miR-193a-3p	is	downregulated	in	ulcerative	colitis	neoplasia	,	and	its	loss	promotes	carcinogenesis	through	upregulation	of	IL17RD	.	.
s3934	cytoskeletal_anchoring_at_plasma_membrane	-	related	disorders	are	classified	as	spondylocarpotarsal	synostosis	(	SCT	)	,	Larsen	syndrome	(	LS	)	,	atelosteogenesis	(	AO	)	,	boomerang	dysplasia	(	BD	)	,	and	isolated	congenital	talipes	equinovarus	,	presenting	with	scoliosis	,	short	-	limbed	dwarfism	,	clubfoot	,	joint	dislocation	and	other	unique	skeletal_abnormalities	.	.
s995	Although	disruption	of	the	G1/S_transition_of_mitotic_cell_cycle_(INK4A	/	ARF	)	locus	has	been	reported	in	end	-	stage	disease	,	information	is	lacking	on	the	status	of	this	key	tumor_suppressor	gene	in	pleural	lesions	preceding	mesothelioma	.	.
s2051	Our	data	suggest	that	only	a	small	subset	of	negative_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	-	wildtype	CS	/	CS	-	like	and	BRRS	patients	could	be	accounted	for	by	germline	variants	in	some	of	the	known	cancer	-	related	genes	.	.
s3261	This	study	systematically	reviewed	previous	literatures	and	analyzed	the	genotype	-	phenotype	relationship	between	the	multiple	endocrine	neoplasia_type	2A	(	MEN	2A)-cutaneous	lichen	amyloidosis	(	CLA	)	and	RET	/	OSMR	/	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_mutations	.	.
s1173	To	test	the	hypothesis	that	cell_volume_homeostasis_overexpression	causes	obesity	,	we	created	bacterial	artificial	chromosome	(	BAC	)	transgenic	mice	that	carry	an	extra	copy	of	the	human	GNB3	risk	allele	.	.
s2058	We	also	found	that	miRNA_catabolic_process_is	able	to	bind	a	conserved	GGAG	motif	of	pre	-	miR-125a	and	to	inhibit	its	maturation	in	hepatocellular_carcinoma_cells	.	.
s2236	These	results	suggest	that	negative_regulation_of_erythrocyte_differentiation_and	MAFF	play	critical	roles	in	the	antitumor_effects	of	retinoids	by	regulating	the	expression	of	retinoid	target	genes	such	as	TFPI2	and	can	be	promising	for	developing	therapies	to	combat	HCC	invasion	.
s1915	4B	,	P	=	.000).Hyper	expression	of	protein_localization_to_kinetochore_maybe	an	adverse	event	for	the	survival	of	some	cancer	patients	,	especially	in	glioblastoma	,	kidney	cancer	,	and	lung	cancer	patients	,	which	has	been	verified	in	112	lung	cancer	patients	with	MTBP	status	.
s2007	Importantly	,	bone	cell	activity	was	inversely	correlated	to	tumor_cell	AR	activity	(	measured	as	AR	,	response_to_estradiol	,	HOXB13	,	KLK2	,	KLK3	,	NKX3	-	1	,	STEAP2	,	and	TMPRSS2	expression	)	and	to	patient	serum	prostate	-	specific	antigen	(	PSA	)	levels	.	.
s2127	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	biological_process	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s1353	These	results	demonstrate	a	previously	unrecognized	relationship	between	p53	and	error	-	prone_translesion_synthesis_in	cancer_cell	metabolism	and	may	lead	to	improvements	in	chemotherapy	treatment	plans	that	reduce	cisplatin	resistance	in	lung	cancer	.
s1559	Pain	scores	correlated	with	total	body	tumor	volume	(	rho	=	0.32471	,	P	=	.0499	)	,	but	not	with	number	of	tumors	(	rho	=	0.23065	,	P	=	.1696).We	found	no	significant	difference	in	quantitative	tumor	burden	between	mutational	groups	,	but	spinal	schwannomas_were	more	common	in	anatomical_structure_morphogenesis	-	mutant	patients	.	.
s2490	Humans	who	carry	kidney_development_mutations	develop	heterogeneous	renal	abnormalities	,	including	multicystic	dysplastic	kidneys	,	glomerulocystic	kidney	disease	,	renal	agenesis	,	renal	hypoplasia	,	and	renal_interstitial_fibrosis	.	.
s2690	Five	genes	,	including	OTOGL	,	PLCB4	,	SCEL	,	THSD4	,	and	WWOX	,	have	CNVs	in	the	six	patients	with	sporadic_HBs	,	and	three	genes	,	including	ABCA6	,	CWC27	,	and	muscle_organ_development	,	have	CNVs	in	the	five	patients	with	familial	HBs	.	.
s2766	Disorders	in	the	ISC	machinery	affect	numerous	transcriptional_open_complex_formation_at_RNA_polymerase_II_promoter	-	S	proteins	and	lead	to	a	heterogeneous_group	of	diseases	with	a	wide	variety	of	clinical	symptoms	and	combined	enzymatic	defects	.	.
s3290	However	,	the	current	knowledge	of	negative_regulation_of_kinase_activity_in	breast	cancer_remains	obscure	.	.
s979	Mutations	in	the	cyclin	F	gene	(	negative_regulation_of_centrosome_duplication	)	have	been	recently	identified	in	a	small	number	of	patients	with	amyotrophic	lateral	sclerosis	(	ALS	)	and/or	frontotemporal_dementia	,	and	their	role	in	patients	with	ALS	in	Taiwan	remains	elusive	.	.
s3887	Mutations	in	cognition_were	suspected	in	this	non	-	syndromic	ID	case	with	mutism	.	.
s3571	Methods	,	Quantitative	real	-	time	polymerase	chain	reaction	(	qRT	-	PCR	)	was	applied	to	detect	the	expression	level	of	skeletal_system_development	-	AS	in	cell	lines	HET-1A	,	EC9706	,	EC109	,	and	in	tumor_tissue	and	paired	adjacent	tissue	samples	from	73	ESCC	patients	who	received	surgical	resection	.	The	correlations	of	the	expression	level	of	HOXA11-AS	with	clinicopathological	features	and	prognosis	were	also	analyzed	.	.
s1838	This	review	discusses	recurrent	aberrations	in	NKTCL	detected	by	NGS	,	which	can	be	categorized	into	three	main	groups	,	specifically	,	tumor_suppressors	(	TP53	,	DDX3X	,	and	starch_catabolic_process	)	,	the	JAK	/	STAT	cascade	,	and	epigenetic	modifiers	(	KMT2D	,	BCOR	,	ARID1A	,	and	EP300	)	.	.
s3487	In	the	present	study	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_variants	were	screened	in	a	large	series	of	Japanese	hearing_loss_(HL	)	patients	to	clarify	the	prevalence	and	clinical	characteristics	of	DFNA6/14/38	and	Wolfram	-	like	syndrome	.	.
s2599	In	addition	,	silencing	of	CtBP2	markedly	increased	the	apoptosis	of	PCa	cells	in	vitro	,	and	decreased	the	expression	of	IL-8	,	AT2R	,	CCND1	and	proteolysis_which	are	associated	with	cancer_progression	.	.
s3025	We	observed	that	the	alternatively	spliced	transcripts	of	a	subset	of	these	genes	,	involved	in	proliferation	and	tumor_cell	migration	like	REPIN1/AP4	,	ST3GAL6	,	selenocysteine_incorporation_and	PFKM	are	degraded	upon	loss	of	PRMT5	.	.
s3699	Furthermore	,	negative_regulation_of_peptidase_activity_expression	was	observed	in	all	22	lymph	node	metastases	analyzed	.	Relatively	high	levels	of	CSTA	expression	in	tumors	were	correlated	with	tumor	progression	and	advanced	cancer_stage	,	including	lymph	node	metastasis	.
s285	As	the	striking	syndactyly_observed	in	the	present	case	is	typical	for	FLPIS	,	we	suggest	CREBBP	analysis	in	saliva	samples	for	FLPIS	syndrome	cases	in	which	no	causal	biological_process_variant	is	detected	.
s1188	Another	polymorphism	in	ZBTB38-MAPK_cascade_has	been	observed	to	be	associated	with	the	susceptibility	of	sporadic_Creutzfeldt	-	Jacob	disease	(	sCJD	)	in	UK	.	.
s2996	We	also	found	that	increased	protein_polyubiquitination-663	expression	in	breast	tumors	consistently	correlates	with	increased	patient	survival	.	.
s3453	The	tumor	suppressor	characteristics	of	cyclin	-	dependent	kinase	10	(	peptidyl	-	threonine_phosphorylation	)	in	nasopharyngeal	carcinoma	and	breast	cancer_have	been	previously	demonstrated	.	.
s523	To	date	variants	in	four	genes	GLI3	,	ZNF141	,	MIPOL1	and	anatomical_structure_morphogenesis_have	been	implicated	in	developing	non	-	syndromic	form	of	polydactyly	.	.
s3517	In	parallel	,	we	recently	reported	that	positive_regulation_of_I	-	kappaB_kinase	/	NF	-	kappaB_signaling	-	deficient	mice	present	with	cognitive	and	social	deficits	,	hyperactivity_and	anxiety	.	.
s1410	As	a	result	,	regulation_of_autophagy_depletion	using	CRISPR	/	Cas9	nuclease	system	inhibits	tumor_growth	in	xenografted	nude	mice	.	.
s1942	However	,	in	HaCaT	and	HEK293	T	cells	that	display	transformed	phenotypes	,	but	do	not	originate	from	patient	-	derived	tumors	,	the	ER	stress	-	inducing	treatments	resulted	in	an	upregulation	of	FAM129A	and	HKDC1	,	but	not	KRT16	transcripts	,	By	a	luciferase	reporter	approach	we	identified	a	highly	active	response_to_endoplasmic_reticulum_stress	-	responsive	element	within	the	upstream	region	of	the	KRT16	gene	.	.
s2845	Knockdown	of	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_in	colorectal	cancer_cells	reset	the	altered	metabolism	and	suppressed	cell	growth	.	.
s3992	Defects	of	positive_regulation_of_cytosolic_calcium_ion_concentration	,	calcium-	and	integrin	-	binding	protein	2	,	have	been	reported	to	cause	isolated	deafness	,	DFNB48	and	Usher	syndrome	type	-	IJ	,	characterized	by	congenital	profound	deafness	,	balance	defects	and	blindness	.	.
s16	Mutations	in	the	superoxide_metabolic_process_gene	coding	for	the	Tks4	protein	are	responsible	for	the	autosomal_recessive_Frank	-	ter	Haar	syndrome	.	.
s3145	We	confirmed	variants	in	mitotic_cytokinesis_as	the	most	common	high	-	penetrant	genetic	factor	associated	with	pancreatic	cancer_and	we	also	identified	candidate	pancreatic	cancer	genes	.	.
s700	Various	genes	(	eg	,	SPG7	,	SYNE1	,	glycerophospholipid_catabolic_process	)	traditionally	rooted	in	either	the	ataxia_or	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	classification	system	have	now	been	shown	to	cause	ataxia	on	the	one	end	of	the	disease	continuum	and	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	on	the	other	.	.
s219	Autosomal	-	recessive	optic	neuropathies	are	rare	blinding	conditions	related	to	retinal	ganglion	cell	(	RGC	)	and	optic	-	nerve_degeneration	,	for	which	only	mutations	in	TMEM126A	and	tricarboxylic_acid_cycle_are	known	.	.
s1026	Biallelic	mutations	in	these	genes	cause	Fanconi	anemia	(	FA	)	,	characterized	by	malformations	,	bone	marrow	failure	,	chromosome	fragility	,	and	cancer_predisposition	(	BRCA2/mitotic_cytokinesis_and	PALB2/FANCN	)	,	or	an	FA	-	like	disease	presenting	a	phenotype	similar	to	FA	but	without	bone	marrow	failure	(	BRCA1/FANCS	)	.	.
s2188	BACKGROUND	This	case	-	control	study	aimed	to	analyze	the	association	of	strand_invasion_polymorphisms	(	rs3218408	and	rs3218384	)	with	colorectal	cancer_(CRC	)	risk	.	.
s2177	Mutations	in	the	extracellular_matrix_organization_gene	result	in	X	-	linked	Alport	syndrome	,	homozygous	or	compound	heterozygous	mutations	in	COL4A3	or	COL4A4	are	responsible	for	autosomal_recessive_Alport	syndrome	,	and	heterozygous	mutations	in	COL4A3	or	COL4A4	cause	autosomal	dominant	Alport	syndrome	or	benign	familial	hematuria	.	.
s2688	Five	genes	,	including	OTOGL	,	PLCB4	,	SCEL	,	THSD4	,	and	negative_regulation_of_Wnt_signaling_pathway	,	have	CNVs	in	the	six	patients	with	sporadic_HBs	,	and	three	genes	,	including	ABCA6	,	CWC27	,	and	LAMA2	,	have	CNVs	in	the	five	patients	with	familial	HBs	.	.
s2348	To	identify	novel	susceptibility	genes	and	gene	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templateds	for	obesity	,	we	conducted	a	genomewide	expression	association	analysis	of	obesity	via	integrating	genomewide	association	study	(	GWAS	)	and	expression	quantitative	trait	loci	(	eQTLs	)	data	.	.
s3572	Methods	,	Quantitative	real	-	time	polymerase	chain	reaction	(	qRT	-	PCR	)	was	applied	to	detect	the	expression	level	of	HOXA11-positive_regulation_of_T_cell_mediated_cytotoxicity_in	cell	lines	HET-1A	,	EC9706	,	EC109	,	and	in	tumor_tissue	and	paired	adjacent	tissue	samples	from	73	ESCC	patients	who	received	surgical	resection	.	The	correlations	of	the	expression	level	of	HOXA11-AS	with	clinicopathological	features	and	prognosis	were	also	analyzed	.	.
s4072	Here	,	we	examined	the	possibility	that	positive_regulation_of_integrin_activation_is	involved	in	the	regulation	of	synovial	sarcoma_cell	-	viability	.	.
s2111	MDR	rectal	colonization	occurs	in	6.5	%	of	haematological	inpatients	and	predicts	a	16	%	probability	of	MDRrel	BSI	,	particularly	during	neutropenia	,	as	well	as	a	higher	probability	of	unfavourable	outcomes	in	positive_regulation_of_cytosolic_calcium_ion_concentration	-	rel	BSIs	.	.
s794	Segregation	analysis	of	heterozygous	variants	,	related	to	hearing_loss	,	identified	by	whole	exome	sequencing	in	the	child	(	ILDR1	,	c.1159TAAAAC	,	establishment_of_epithelial_cell_apical	/	basal_polarity	,	c.313GAAAAC	,	and	GPR98	,	c.18746TAAAAG	)	excluded	them	from	being	responsible	for	the	hearing	loss	in	the	proposita	.	.
s379	negative_regulation_of_phosphatase_activity_expression	was	closely	related	to	tumor_differentiation	(	P=.039	)	,	tumor	-	node	-	metastasis	stage	(	P=.009	)	,	lymph	node	metastasis	(	P=.038	)	,	and	prognosis	(	P=.043	)	of	lung	cancer	.	.
s582	Knockdown	of	proteasomal_protein_catabolic_process_in	gastric	cancer_cells	suppressed	cell	proliferation	,	caused	G1	arrest	and	inhibited	cell	invasion	.	.
s1836	homophilic_cell_adhesion_via_plasma_membrane_adhesion_molecules	-	knockout	mice	may	provide	a	valuable	rodent	model	for	research	on	autism_spectrum	diseases	and	neurodevelopmental	disorders	.
s1342	Third	,	the	retinal_degeneration_associated	with	the	disruption	of	the	visual	cycle	in	positive_regulation_of_gene_expression	-	deficient	mice	can	be	partially	corrected	both	structurally	and	functionally	by	an	exogenous	supply	of	9-cis	-	retinal	.	.
s1463	Higher	pre	-	NACT	nuclear	Prx	I	expression	predicted	smaller	size	of	a	resected	tumor_(p	=	0.00052	,	r	=	-0.550	)	,	and	higher	pre	-	NACT	cytoplasmic	Prx	I	expression	predicted	a	lower	amount	of	evacuated	positive_regulation_of_cysteine	-	type_endopeptidase_activity_involved_in_apoptotic_process_metastasis	(	p	=	0.0024	,	r	=	-0.472	)	.	.
s3555	Of	the	2	204	genes	that	were	mutated	,	APC	,	TTN	,	TP53	,	KRAS	,	OBSCN	,	SOX9	,	PCDH17	,	SIGLEC10	,	regulation_of_the_force_of_heart_contraction	,	and	BRD9	were	consistent	with	genes	being	an	early	driver	of	carcinogenesis	,	in	that	they	were	mutated	in	multiple	adenomas	and	multiple	carcinomas	.	.
s283	The	best	candidate	causal	variants	for	ER(-	)	tumors	lie	in	four	separate	enhancer	elements	,	and	their	risk	alleles	reduce	expression	of	ESR1	,	positive_regulation_of_mitochondrial_translation_and	CCDC170	,	whereas	the	risk	alleles	of	the	strongest	candidates	for	the	remaining	independent	causal	variant	disrupt	a	silencer	element	and	putatively	increase	ESR1	and	RMND1	expression	.	.
s314	Like	USP22	,	protein_deubiquitination_and	USP27X	are	required	for	normal	cell	proliferation	,	and	their	depletion	suppresses	tumor_growth	.	.
s2792	Biallelic	loss	-	of	-	function	mutations	affecting	growth_plate_cartilage_chondrocyte_development_cause	SOFT	syndrome	,	an	ultra	-	rare	condition	characterized	by	short	stature	,	onychodysplasia	,	facial_dysmorphism_and	hypotrichosis	.	.
s3279	The	data	showed	that	interfering	fat_cell_differentiation_may	inhibit	the	migration	and	proliferation	of	glioma_cells	by	reducing	expression	of	cyclin	A	,	cyclin	B1	,	cyclin	D1	,	Vimentin	,	and	N	-	cadherin	,	and	by	increasing	expression	of	E	-	cadherin	.	.
s3298	LncRNA	protein_phosphorylation_antisense	RNA	1	(	MLK7-AS1	)	has	been	identified	as	one	of	gastric	cancer	-	specific	lncRNAs	.	.
