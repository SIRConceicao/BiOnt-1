s3307	However	,	the	clinical	implication	of	p	-	regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_expression	in	colon	cancer_is	still	controversial	.	.
s1105	Several	tumor_suppressor	genes	and	proto	-	oncogenes	have	been	implicated	in	BCC	pathogenesis	,	including	the	key	components	of	the	Hedgehog	pathway	,	PTCH1	and	polyamine_catabolic_process	,	the	TP53	tumor	suppressor	,	and	members	of	the	RAS	proto	-	oncogene	family	.	.
s1564	Our	data	unveiled	a	previously	unknown	mechanism	in	the	regulation	of	adipocyte	insulin	signaling	by	regulation_of_small_GTPase_mediated_signal_transduction_and	identified	its	significant	role	in	systemic	metabolic	homeostasis	,	shedding	light	on	Fam13a	as	a	pharmacotherapeutic	target	to	treat	obesity	-	related	metabolic	disorders	.
s3721	Our	results	provide	further	support	that	toxin_metabolic_process	,	CNNM2	and	CALHM1	are	involved	with	the	etiology	and	pathogenesis	of	schizophrenia	,	suggesting	these	genes	are	potential	targets	of	interest	for	the	improvement	of	disease	management	and	the	development	of	novel	pharmacological	strategies	.
s3398	In	the	pathway	analysis	,	targets	of	protein_polyubiquitination-23b-3p	were	primarily	enriched	in	the	signaling	pathways	of	renal_cell_carcinoma	,	hepatitis	B	and	pancreatic	cancer	(	corrected	P	-	value	AAAA0.05	)	.	.
s422	Importantly	,	we	found	that	CD133	expression	in	glioma_was	highly	correlated	with	the	expression	of	HOX	gene	stem	cell	factors	(	HOXA5	,	HOXA7	,	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	HOXC4	and	HOXC6	)	.	.
s250	Taken	together	,	these	data	open	venues	for	exploring	the	possibility	that	sporadic	breast	cancer_patients	with	EMSY	amplification	might	benefit	from	epigenetic	combination	therapy	targeting	both	the	histone_H3-K9_demethylation_demethylase	and	histone	deacetylases	.	.
s3379	lens_development_in_camera	-	type_eye-/-	mice	reproduced	the	alterations	described	in	patients	with	advanced	PD	and	in	well	accepted	toxin	-	based	models	of	PD	and	dyskinesia	.	.
s2110	MDR	rectal	colonization	occurs	in	6.5	%	of	haematological	inpatients	and	predicts	a	16	%	probability	of	MDRnegative_regulation_of_gene_expression_BSI	,	particularly	during	neutropenia	,	as	well	as	a	higher	probability	of	unfavourable	outcomes	in	CR	-	rel	BSIs	.	.
s854	Metabolic	cutis	laxa	results	from	Menkes	syndrome	,	caused	by	a	defect	in	the	ATPase	copper	transporting	alpha	(	ATP7A	)	gene	,	congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	due	to	mutations	in	subunit	7	of	the	component	of	oligomeric	Golgi	(	COG7)-congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	(	CDG	)	complex	,	combined	disorder	of	N-	and	O	-	linked	glycosylation	,	due	to	mutations	in	ATPase	H+	transporting	V0	subunit	a2	(	ATP6VOA2	)	gene	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	reductase	1	deficiency	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	synthase	deficiency	,	macrocephaly	,	alopecia	,	cutis	laxa	,	and	scoliosis	(	MACS	)	syndrome	,	due	to	Ras	and	Rab	interactor	2	(	RIN2	)	mutations	,	transaldolase	deficiency	caused	by	mutations	in	the	transaldolase	1	(	TALDO1	)	gene	,	Gerodermia	osteodysplastica	due	to	mutations	in	the	golgin	,	RAB6-interacting	(	GORAB	or	SCYL1BP1	)	gene	,	and	mitogen	-	activated	pathway	(	MAP	)	kinase	defects	,	caused	by	mutations	in	several	genes	[	protein	tyrosine	phosphatase	,	non	-	receptor	-	type	11	(	PTPN11	)	,	RAF	,	NF	,	HRas	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	HRAS	)	,	B	-	Raf	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	protein_phosphorylation	)	,	MEK1/2	,	KRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	KRAS	)	,	SOS	Ras	/	Rho	guanine	nucleotide	exchange	factor	2	(	SOS2	)	,	leucine	rich	repeat	scaffold	protein	(	SHOC2	)	,	NRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	NRAS	)	,	and	Raf-1	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	RAF1	)	]	,	which	regulate	the	Ras	-	MAPK	cascade	.	.
s2671	FLNB	-	related	disorders	are	classified	as	spondylocarpotarsal	synostosis	(	brain_development	)	,	Larsen	syndrome	(	LS	)	,	atelosteogenesis	(	AO	)	,	boomerang	dysplasia	(	BD	)	,	and	isolated	congenital	talipes	equinovarus	,	presenting	with	scoliosis	,	short	-	limbed	dwarfism	,	clubfoot	,	joint	dislocation	and	other	unique	skeletal_abnormalities	.	.
s632	Here	we	show	that	the	X	-	linked	intellectual_disability_protein	interleukin-1	receptor	accessory	protein	like	1	(	regulation_of_postsynapse_organization	)	regulates	dendrite	morphology	of	mice	hippocampal	neurons	and	induced	pluripotent	stem	cell	-	derived	neurons	from	a	patient	carrying	a	null	mutation	of	IL1RAPL1	gene	.	.
s1251	In	contrast	,	LRIG2	appears	to	function	as	a	tumor_promoter	,	while	otolith_morphogenesis_appears	to	have	a	function	similar	to	that	of	LRIG1	.	.
s3628	These	findings	suggest	that	the	Warburg	pathway	enzyme	fructose_2,6-bisphosphate_metabolic_process_acts	as	a	molecular	fulcrum	that	couples	sugar	metabolism	to	transcriptional	activation	by	stimulating	SRC-3	to	promote	aggressive	metastatic	tumours	.
s1215	The	MKK1/2	kinase	tumour_progression	locus	2	(	signal_transduction_by_protein_phosphorylation	)	is	critical	for	the	production	of	tumour	necrosis	factor	alpha	(	TNFa	)	in	innate	immune	responses	and	a	potential	anti	-	inflammatory	drug	target	.	.
s2253	Collectively	,	our	findings	indicate	that	up	-	regulated	mRNA	expression	of	RNF31	,	RBCK1	and	regulation_of_tumor_necrosis_factor	-	mediated_signaling_pathway_could	potentially	be	diagnostic	biomarkers	of	breast	cancer_and	RNF31	might	be	a	drug	target	for	ERalpha	-	negative	breast	cancers	.
s925	Highlights	include	the	discoveries	of	(	i	)	a	new	genetic	etiology	,	autosomal_recessive_SPPL2a	deficiency	,	(	ii	)	TYK2-deficient	patients	with	a	clinical	phenotype	of	MSMD	,	(	iii	)	an	allelic	form	of	partial	recessive	IFN	-	yR2	deficiency	,	and	(	iv	)	two	forms	of	syndromic	MSMD	,	RORy	/	RORyT	and	interleukin-2-mediated_signaling_pathway_deficiencies	.	.
s3504	Analyses	of	microRNA	(	protein_polyubiquitinationNA	)	expression	signatures	obtained	by	RNA	sequencing	revealed	that	some	passenger	miRNAs	(	miR-144	-	5p	,	miR-145	-	3p	,	miR-149	-	3p	,	miR-150	-	3p	,	and	miR-199a-3p	)	acted	as	anti	-	tumor_miRNAs	in	several	types	of	cancer	cells	.	.
s2532	Smith	-	Magenis	syndrome	(	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	)	,	a	neurodevelopmental	disorder	characterized	by	dysmorphic	features	,	intellectual_disability_(ID	)	,	and	sleep	disturbances	,	results	from	a	17p11.2	microdeletion	or	a	mutation	in	the	RAI1	gene	.	.
s243	Here	we	used	Sanger	sequencing	to	detect	mutations	in	exons	of	biological_process_in	340	unrelated	probands	with	spinocerebellar	ataxia_for	whom	commonly	known	causative	mutations	have	been	excluded	(	96	probands	of	autosomal	dominant	spinocerebellar	ataxia	families	and	244	patients	with	sporadic	spinocerebellar	ataxia	)	.	.
s235	Germline	mutations	in	potassium_ion_import_across_plasma_membrane_and	CACNA1H	cause	FH	-	III	and	FH	-	IV	,	respectively	,	while	germline	mutations	in	CACNA1D	cause	the	rare	PASNA	syndrome	,	featuring	primary	aldosteronism	seizures_and	neurological	abnormalities	.	.
s2558	Expectedly	,	the	analysis	of	the	DEGs	common	to	all	three	alterations	highlighted	a	group	of	BioFunctions	that	included	Cell	Proliferation	of	tumor	cell	lines	(	14	DEGs	)	,	Invasion	of	cells	(	10	DEGs	)	and	Migration	of	tumour_cell	lines	(	10	DEGs	)	,	with	a	common	core	of	5	genes	(	ATF3	,	CDKN1A	,	GDF15	,	HBEGF	and	LCN2	)	that	likely	represent	downstream	effectors	of	the	pro	-	oncogenic	activities	of	PI3K	/	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_signalling	.	.
s1509	A	replicative	analysis	of	associations	of	15	SNPs	located	in	the	regions	of	11	genes	(	TCF4	,	VRK2	,	NOTCH4	,	ZNF804A	,	AGBL1	,	RELN	,	ZFP64P1	,	KCNB2	,	CSMD1	,	CPVL	,	NRIP1	)	and	three	intergenic	regions	(	SLCO6A1/LINCOO491	,	LOC105376248/LOC105376249	,	spermatogenesis	/	NRGN	)	with	schizophrenia_was	conducted	in	the	Russian	population	of	the	Siberian	region	.	.
s3157	Defects	of	CIB2	,	calcium-	and	integrin	-	binding	protein	2	,	have	been	reported	to	cause	isolated	deafness	,	DFNB48	and	Usher	syndrome	cardiac_muscle_tissue_development	-	IJ	,	characterized	by	congenital	profound_deafness	,	balance	defects	and	blindness	.	.
s3742	Our	work	confirms	that	the	phenotype	and	the	mode	of	inheritance	associated	with	phototransduction,_visible_light_variants	can	vary	from	autosomal	dominant	,	autosomal	recessive	congenital	stationary	night	blindness_to	autosomal	recessive	rod	-	cone	dystrophy	.
s3823	We	find	that	lung	squamous_cell_carcinoma_(SQCC	)	,	which	accounts	for	~20	%	of	lung	cancer	,	exhibits	increased	expression	of	the	PI3	K	subunit	phosphatidylinositol_3-kinase_signaling	,	which	is	at	low	expression	levels	in	normal	tissues	.	.
s497	While	polyglutamine	ataxias	,	linked	to	CAG	repeat	expansions	in	genes	such	as	ATXN1	,	ATXN2	,	protein_K63-linked_deubiquitination	,	ATXN7	,	CACNA1A	and	TBP	,	have	been	extensively	characterized	in	large	cohorts	,	there	is	a	need	for	comprehensive	assessment	of	frequency	and	phenotype	of	more	_	conventional	_	ataxias	.	.
s4082	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	cell	-	matrix_adhesion	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.

s2562	Expectedly	,	the	analysis	of	the	DEGs	common	to	all	three	alterations	highlighted	a	group	of	BioFunctions	that	included	Cell	Proliferation	of	tumor	cell	lines	(	14	DEGs	)	,	Invasion	of	cells	(	10	DEGs	)	and	Migration	of	tumour_cell	lines	(	10	DEGs	)	,	with	a	common	core	of	5	genes	(	ATF3	,	CDKN1A	,	GDF15	,	HBEGF	and	defense_response_to_bacterium	)	that	likely	represent	downstream	effectors	of	the	pro	-	oncogenic	activities	of	PI3K	/	AKT	signalling	.	.
s1676	Mutations	in	anterograde_neuronal_dense_core_vesicle_transport_are	responsible	for	autosomal	recessive	spastic	paraplegia	type	58	(	SPG58	)	and	spastic	ataxia_2	(	SPAX2	)	.	.
s1295	In	a	clinical	sense	,	recognizing	those	IHH	genes	and	associated	phenotypes	may	improve	our	diagnostic	capabilities	by	enabling	us	to	prioritize	the	screening	of	particular	gene(s	)	such	as	synkinesia	(	chemotaxis	)	,	dental_agenesis_(FGF8/FGFR1	)	and	hearing	loss	(	CHD7	)	.	.
s1130	In	conclusion	,	our	findings	firstly	revealed	that	negative_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_switches	chemotherapy	drug	-	induced	caspase-3	dependent	apoptosis	into	pyroptosis	in	gastric	cancer_cells	.
s4047	In	particular	,	MYH9	mutations	result	in	congenital	macrothrombocytopenia	and	predispose	to	kidney	failure	,	hearing_loss	,	and	cataracts	,	MPL	and	MECOM	mutations	cause	congenital	thrombocytopenia	evolving	into	bone	marrow	failure	,	whereas	thrombocytopenias	caused	by	RUNX1	,	ANKRD26	,	and	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_mutations	are	characterized	by	predisposition	to	hematological	malignancies	.	.
s732	Recently	mutations	in	the	CASPR	/	CNTN1	complex	have	been	associated	with	similar	severe	phenotypes	and	central_nervous_system_myelination_gene	mutations	,	causing	loss	of	the	CASPR	protein	,	were	shown	to	cause	severe	,	prenatal_onset_arthrogryposis	multiplex	congenita	in	four	unrelated	families	.	.
s3338	Corresponding	implicated	genes	,	such	as	TNNI3	K	,	ErbB3	,	MKL2	,	MTNR1B	and	protein_phosphorylation	,	may	explain	the	associations	between	reproductive	factors	and	heart_failure	.	.
s463	Furthermore	,	SLC6A9	-	5,2	overexpression	was	positively	correlated	with	protein_ADP	-	ribosylation-1	mRNA	and	protein	levels	,	which	restored	the	sensitivity	of	resistant	thyroid	cancer_cells	.	.
s2234	The	musculo	-	aponeurotic	fibrosarcoma_oncogene	homolog	B	(	MAFB	)	significantly	enhanced	the	activation	of	the	TFPI2	promoter	via	RARAAAAAalpha	,	while	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_inhibited	it	.	.
s1161	Here	,	we	investigated	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_mRNA	and	protein	expressions	in	colon	cancer_cells	or	surgically	resected	CRC	.	.
s1201	In	particular	,	MYH9	mutations	result	in	congenital	macrothrombocytopenia	and	predispose	to	kidney	failure	,	hearing_loss	,	and	cataracts	,	MPL	and	MECOM	mutations	cause	congenital	thrombocytopenia	evolving	into	bone	marrow	failure	,	whereas	thrombocytopenias	caused	by	hemopoiesis	,	ANKRD26	,	and	ETV6	mutations	are	characterized	by	predisposition	to	hematological	malignancies	.	.
s110	We	validated	ZBTB20	,	CELF2	,	PARD3	,	AKAP13	and	cellular_response_to_DNA_damage_stimulus	,	which	were	identified	by	our	screens	in	multiple	cancer	types	,	as	new	tumor_suppressor	genes	in	prostate	cancer	.	.
s881	The	PHKG2	and	histone_monoubiquitination_genes	are	either	overlapping	or	close	to	the	sequences	of	SCAR	marker	BC13	-	4	,	while	SCAR	marker	BC10	-	1	is	in	the	intron	and	overlap	the	DPEP1	gene	,	suggesting	that	alterations	in	the	expression	of	these	genes	could	contribute	to	cancer_progression	.	.
s1813	In	wild	type	(	WT	)	mice	,	we	found	that	ginsenoside	Rg3	treatment	significantly	mitigated	pathological	damages	and	reduced	myeloperoxidase	(	MPO	)	activity	as	well	as	the	production	of	pro	-	inflammatory	cytokines	tumor_necrosis	factor	-	a	(	TNF	-	a	)	,	interleukin-1b	(	IL-1b	)	and	interleukin-6	(	IL-6	)	,	furthermore	,	the	production	of	anti	-	inflammatory	mediators	interleukin-10	(	IL-10	)	and	transforming	growth	factor	-	b	(	TGF	-	b	)	,	polarization	of	M2	macrophages	and	expression	levels	of	the	phosphorylation	of	phosphatidylinositol	3-hydroxy	kinase	(	phosphorylation	)	,	protein	kinase	B	(	PKB	,	also	known	as	AKT	)	,	mammalian	target	of	rapamycin	(	mTOR	)	and	Mer	receptor	tyrosine	kinase	(	MerTK	)	were	promoted	.	.
s976	We	found	miR-4326	targets	tumor_suppressor	adenomatous	polyposis	coli	2	(	protein_K11-linked_ubiquitination	)	,	which	is	a	negative	regulator	of	Wnt	pathway	,	by	binding	to	the	3	UTR	of	APC2	.	.
s1378	The	contiguous	deletion	of	Wnt_signaling_pathway_and	its	neighbouring	genes	,	MAOA	/	B	and	EFHC2	,	reportedly	leads	to	syndromic	clinical	features	such	as	microcephaly	,	intellectual_disability	,	and	epilepsy	.	.
s2878	The	results	revealed	that	the	most	PR	-	specific	proteins	were	associated	with	events	involved	in	tumor_development	,	while	chemotherapy	in	the	biological_process_group	was	associated	with	side	effects	of	drugs	and/or	cancer	recurrence	.	.

s3194	Non	-	invasive	follicular	thyroid	neoplasm_with	papillary	-	like	nuclear	features	(	NIFTP	)	is	an	indolent	thyroid	tumor	characterized	by	frequent	RAS	mutations	and	an	absence	of	the	protein_phosphorylation_V600E	mutation	commonly	seen	in	classical	papillary	thyroid	carcinoma	(	cPTC	)	.	.
s2802	The	PCH1sub	-	types	with	early	death	(	between	ages	1	day	and	17	months	)	,	seen	in	patients	with	p	.	G31A	/	EXOSC3	or	SLC25A46	mutations	have	a	spliceosomal_snRNP_assembly_type	1-like	clinical	presentation	but	with	global	developmental	delay	,	visual	and	hearing	impairment	,	with	or	without	microcephaly	,	nystagmus	and	optic	atrophy	.	.
s2083	We	examined	differences	in	the	expression	levels	of	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_in	GC	and	adjacent	non	-	cancerous	tissues	.	.
s2544	Collectively	,	our	data	illustrate	that	persistent	Hh	signaling	in	the	palatal	epithelium	contributes	to	the	etiology	and	pathogenesis	of	submucous	cleft_palate_through	its	interaction	with	a	p63/cell_cycle_arrest	-	dependent	biological	regulatory	loop	and	through	a	p63-induced	cell	adhesion	network	.
s1205	In	particular	,	MYH9	mutations	result	in	congenital	macrothrombocytopenia	and	predispose	to	kidney	failure	,	hearing	loss	,	and	cataracts	,	MPL	and	MECOM	mutations	cause	congenital	thrombocytopenia	evolving	into	bone	marrow	failure	,	whereas	thrombocytopenias	caused	by	RUNX1	,	negative_regulation_of_fat_cell_differentiation	,	and	ETV6	mutations	are	characterized	by	predisposition	to	hematological	malignancies	.	.
s3425	Recent	studies	identified	a	close	association	between	the	c.14576GAAAAA	(	p	.	R4859	K	,	rs112735431	)	variant	of	the	ring	finger	protein	213	(	protein_ubiquitination	)	gene	and	sporadic	intracranial	arterial_stenosis_(ICAS	)	.	.
s3324	We	here	report	on	the	existence	of	Leber	s	hereditary	optic	neuropathy_(LHON	)	associated	with	peculiar	combinations	of	individually	non	-	pathogenic	missense	mitochondrial	DNA	(	mtDNA	)	variants	,	affecting	the	MT	-	biological_process	,	MT	-	ND4L	and	MT	-	ND6	subunit	genes	of	Complex	I.	.
s4041	The	created	databases	include	ACAD8	(	isobutyryl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	deficiency	(	IBD	)	)	,	ACADSB	(	short	-	chain	acyl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	(	SCAD	)	deficiency	)	,	AUH	(	3-methylglutaconic	aciduria	(	3-MGCA	)	)	,	DHCR7	(	Smith	-	Lemli	-	Opitz	syndrome	)	,	acetyl	-	CoA_metabolic_process_(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl	-	CoA	synthase	2	deficiency	)	,	HSD17B10	(	17-beta	-	hydroxysteroid	dehydrogenase	X	deficiency	)	,	FKBP14	(	Ehlers	-	Danlos	syndrome	with	progressive	kyphoscoliosis	,	myopathy	,	and	hearing	loss	,	EDSKMH	)	and	ROGDI	(	Kohlschutter	-	Tonz	syndrome	)	.	.
s3470	Finally	,	we	demonstrate	that	genetic	inactivation	of	camera	-	type_eye_development_rescues	axial	elongation	in	a	mouse	model	of	myopia_caused	by	a	null	mutation	in	Egr1	.	.
s1805	The	gene	expression	levels	of	Ki-67	,	BCL11A	,	FOXC1	,	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	PCDHGB7	and	her-2	were	used	as	an	auxiliary	diagnostic	index	for	patients	with	breast	cancer_in	the	early	stage	.	.
s2362	Western	blot	was	used	to	analyze	the	cell	cycle	-	related	proteins	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	ataxia_telangiectasia	mutant	(	ATM	)	,	ataxia	telangiectasia	and	Rad3-related	protein	(	ATR	)	and	cyclin	B1	(	positive_regulation_of_G2/M_transition_of_mitotic_cell_cycle	)	.	.

s2779	Here	the	authors	show	that	human	microcephaly_protein	RTTN	directly	interacts	with	centrosome_duplication_and	acts	downstream	of	STIL	-	mediated	centriole	assembly	,	contributing	to	building	full	-	length	centrioles	.
s1324	Fourteen	different	(	half	of	them	novel	)	non	-	GJB2	variants	causing	HL	were	found	in	10	genes	(	CHD7	,	HDAC8	,	MITF	,	NEFL	,	OTOF	,	SF3B4	,	SLC26A4	,	TECTA	,	TMPRSS3	,	sensory_perception_of_sound	)	among	13	probands	,	confirming	the	genetic	heterogeneity_of	hereditary	HL	.	.

s1598	Consistent	with	this	result	,	mutations	in	the	CNTNAP2	gene	coding	for	learning_in	human	have	been	identified	in	neurodevelopmental	disorders	such	as	autism	,	intellectual	disability	,	and	epilepsy	.	.
s3217	Dysfunction	of	the	cerebral	glucose	transporter	GLUT1	(	encoded	by	protein	-	containing_complex_assembly	)	is	known	to	result	in	epilepsy	,	intellectual_disability_(ID	)	,	and	movement	disorder	.	.
s583	These	results	indirectly	demonstrate	that	proteasomal_protein_catabolic_process_enhances	the	proliferation	and	invasion	abilities	of	gastric	cancer_cells	by	upregulating	the	constituent	factors	Wnt	and	b	-	catenin	,	as	well	as	by	negatively	regulating	the	mRNA	and	protein	expression	of	GSK-3b	,	caspase-3	and	cyclin	E.	.
s3544	In	these	5	families	,	we	detected	one	reported	and	six	novel	mutations	in	5	different	deafness_autosomal	recessive	(	DFNB	)	genes	(	TRIOBP	,	LHFPL5	,	calcium_ion_transport	,	PCDH15	,	and	MYO7A	)	.	.
s2281	Variants	of	WNK1	(	lysine	deficient	protein	kinase	1	)	,	desensitization_of_G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway_by_arrestin_(b2	adrenergic	receptor	)	,	NEDD4L	(	ubiquitin	-	protein	ligase	NEDD4-like	)	,	KLK1	(	kallikrein	1	)	contribute	to	hypertension	,	and	AKR1C3	(	aldo	-	keto	reductase	family1	member	C3	)	,	is	associated	with	preeclampsia	.	.
s879	Three	SCAR	markers	(	apoptotic_nuclear_changes-1	,	BC13	-	4	and	BC31	-	2	)	had	high	levels	of	genomic	DNA	amplification	in	breast	cancer	.	.
s1523	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	cilium_assembly	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s2713	She	developed	gastrointestinal	symptoms	,	dysarthria	,	dysphagia_and	weakness	,	and	MNGIE	was	considered	due	to	its	low	retina_homeostasis_levels	and	improvement	after	platelet	transfusions	.	.
s3650	In	the	present	study	,	the	results	of	immumohistochemisty	revealed	that	the	positive	staining	rates	of	NIBP	,	peripheral_nervous_system_development	-	kB	p65	and	NF	-	kB	p	-	p65	in	gastric	cancer_tissues	were	obviously	higher	than	those	in	normal	tissues	.	.
s3678	Depletion	of	positive_regulation_of_cell_death_and	GSALDH	in	humans	leads	to	hyperprolinemia	,	which	is	associated	with	mental	disorders	such	as	schizophrenia	.	.
s3113	Breakthrough	discoveries	include	the	role	of	somatic	variants	in	the	potassium_ion_import_across_plasma_membrane	,	CACNA1D	,	ATP1A1	,	and	ATP2B3	genes	as	causes	of	aldosterone	-	producing	adenomas	(	APAs	)	,	and	the	recognition	of	three	novel	hyperaldosteronism_syndromes	with	germline	variants	in	the	KCNJ5	,	CACNA1D	,	and	CACNA1H	genes	.	.
s1521	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	desmosome_assembly	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s1969	regulation_of_modification_of_postsynaptic_actin_cytoskeleton_activity	is	significantly	increased	in	cortical	cultures	derived	from	LGI1	null	mice	and	using	a	reconstituted	system	,	we	show	directly	that	LGI1	antagonizes	NgR1-tumor_necrosis	factor	receptor	orphan	Y	(	TROY	)	signaling	.	.
s1158	A	recurrent	de	novo	missense	variant	within	the	C	-	terminal	Sin3-like	domain	of	regulation_of_axon_guidance_was	previously	reported	to	cause	acromelic	frontonasal	dysostosis	(	AFND	)	,	an	autosomal	-	dominant	severe	frontonasal	and	limb	malformation	syndrome	,	associated	with	neurocognitive	and	motor_delay	,	via	a	proposed	gain	-	of	-	function	effect	.	.
s425	CD133	(	p	=	0.021	)	and	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_(p	=	0.001	)	were	independent	prognostic	markers	when	the	three	glioma_patient	cohorts	were	combined	(	n	=	231	)	.	.
s643	Moreover	,	ZNF131	and	HAUS5	kd	phenocopied	each	other	in	neural_crest_cell_fate_specifications	,	each	causing	,	mitotic	arrest	,	centrosome	fragmentation	,	loss	of	Augmin	/	HAUS	complex	on	the	mitotic	spindle	,	and	loss	of	GSC	self	-	renewal	and	tumor_formation	capacity	.	.
s2421	Finally	,	both	genetic	and	pharmacological	inactivation	of	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_in	muscle	progenitor	cells	afforded	substantial	protection	against	cancer	-	mediated	cachexia	,	which	translated	into	meaningful	survival	benefits	,	implicating	Twist1	as	a	possible	target	for	attenuating	muscle	cachexia	in	cancer	patients	.
s3506	Ectopic	expression	of	these	protein_polyubiquitinationNAs	showed	that	both	miR-223	-	3p	(	the	guide	strand	)	and	miR-223	-	5p	(	the	passenger	strand	)	inhibited	cancer_cell	migration	and	invasion	of	BC	cells	.	.
s2953	Loss	-	of	-	function	mutations	in	MTM1	cause	the	severe	congenital	myopathy_called	myotubular	myopathy	(	or	X	-	linked	centronuclear	myopathy	)	while	mutations	in	the	MTM1-related	protein	phosphatidylinositol_dephosphorylation_cause	a	recessive	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	peripheral	neuropathy	.	.
s1121	A	novel	hereditary	disorder	encompassing	high	blood	Mn	levels	,	dystonia	,	polycythemia	,	distinctive	T_cell_costimulation_hyperintense	signals	in	the	basal	ganglia	on	magnetic	resonance	imaging	(	MRI	)	brain	,	and	chronic	liver	disease	was	recently	described	.	.
s653	Two	of	these	genes	were	independently	mutated	in	more	than	one	family	with	similar	phenotypes	,	which	substantiates	their	link	to	human	disease	(	regulation_of_membrane_repolarization_in	intellectual_disability_and	UBR4	in	early	dementia	)	.	.
s795	Therefore	,	we	conclude	that	the	novel	splice	-	site	variant	identified	in	extracellular_matrix_organization_is	the	most	likely	cause	for	Steel	syndrome	in	this	family	and	that	the	hearing_loss_is	part	of	this	syndrome	s	phenotype	.
s2604	Oral	cancer_was	associated	with	two	new	regions	,	2p23.3	(	rs6547741	,	GPN1	)	and	9q34.12	(	rs928674	,	extracellular_matrix_organization	)	,	and	with	known	cancer	-	related	loci-9p21.3	(	rs8181047	,	CDKN2B	-	AS1	)	and	5p15.33	(	rs10462706	,	CLPTM1L	)	.	.
s3205	An	inverse	correlation	between	the	expression	levels	of	human	posttranscriptional_regulation_of_gene_expression_and	Nanos3	and	E	-	cadherin	was	observed	in	several	cancer_cell	lines	.	.
s2467	Moreover	,	we	show	that	most	SCLC	tumors	can	be	classified	into	one	of	three	lineages	based	on	the	expression	of	POU2F3	,	ASCL1	,	or	nitric_oxide_mediated_signal_transduction	.	.
s81	In	Mfrprd6	eyes	,	a	significant	1.5-	to	2.0-fold	decrease	was	observed	among	transcripts	of	genes	linked	to	retinal_degeneration	,	including	those	involved	in	visual	cycle	(	Rpe65	,	Lrat	,	G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway	)	,	phototransduction	(	Pde6a	,	Guca1b	,	Rgs9	)	,	and	photoreceptor	disc	morphogenesis	(	Rrelationip1	and	Fscn2	)	.	.
s3148	miR-25	-	3p	,	miR-30a-5p	,	miR-328	and	miR-363	-	3p	directly	targeted	adhesion	-	related	genes	,	including	COL5A1	,	visual_perception	,	ITGA5	,	MMP16	and	THBS2	.	miR-363	-	3p	and	miR-328	inhibited	proliferation	of	renal	cancer_cells	,	while	miR-25	-	3p	inhibited	adhesion	,	promoted	proliferation	and	migration	of	renal	cancer	cells	.	.
s57	The	created	databases	include	ACAD8	(	isobutyryl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	deficiency	(	IBD	)	)	,	ACADSB	(	short	-	chain	acyl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	(	SCAD	)	deficiency	)	,	fatty_acid_beta	-	oxidation_(3-methylglutaconic	aciduria	(	3-MGCA	)	)	,	DHCR7	(	Smith	-	Lemli	-	Opitz	syndrome	)	,	HMGCS2	(	3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl	-	CoA	synthase	2	deficiency	)	,	HSD17B10	(	17-beta	-	hydroxysteroid	dehydrogenase	X	deficiency	)	,	FKBP14	(	Ehlers	-	Danlos	syndrome	with	progressive	kyphoscoliosis	,	myopathy	,	and	hearing	loss	,	EDSKMH	)	and	ROGDI	(	Kohlschutter	-	Tonz	syndrome	)	.	.
s3501	Here	,	we	identify	tumor	-	associated	calcium	signal	transducer	2	(	TACSTD2	)	,	one	of	the	most	downregulated	genes	in	primary	HCC	tissue	,	as	a	host	factor	that	interacts	with	cell	-	cell_junction_organization_and	OCLN	and	regulates	their	cellular	localization	.	.
s4065	Only	overexpression	of	lipid_transport_induced	a	reduction	of	brain	proliferating	cells	and	concomitant	microcephaly	.	.
s1114	We	expand	the	knowledge	about	TTC7A	deficiency	,	describing	a	patient	with	the	mild	phenotype	of	TTC7A	deficiency	but	presenting	overlapping	features	of	SD	/	THE	and	cell_proliferation	-	CID	,	intestinal_atresia_and	inflammatory	bowel	disease	evocative	of	MIA	-	CID	,	but	also	dental	abnormalities	,	huge	forehead	,	liver	abnormalities	,	autoimmune	thyroiditis	and	hypogammaglobulinemia	,	evocative	of	SD	/	THE	.
s1828	Moreover	,	the	disrupted	balance	between	HFs	and	SGs	,	especially	in	the	anatomical_structure_morphogenesis-/-	rabbits	,	can	be	used	as	an	ideal	animal	model	for	dermatology	ailments	,	such	as	acne	and	hypotrichosis	,	in	preclinical	studies	.-	Deng	,	J.	,	Chen	,	M.	,	Liu	,	Z.	,	Song	,	Y.	,	Sui	,	T.	,	Lai	,	L.	,	Li	,	Z.	.
s3586	The	canonical	Hippo	tumor_suppressor	pathway	in	mammalian	cells	is	primarily	composed	of	the	MST1/2-SAV1-LATS1/2-MOB1-regulation_of_cell_cycle	/	TAZ	cascade	.	.
s2371	In	this	investigation	,	using	a	large	multiethnic	cohort	(	1738	subjects	)	,	we	aimed	to	determine	whether	the	magnitude	of	anti	-	cation_transport_antibody	responsiveness	was	significantly	different	in	patients	with	breast	cancer_from	that	in	matched	healthy	controls	.	.
s141	Treatment	with	DNA	methyltransferase	inhibitors	has	been	proposed	as	an	attractive	strategy	to	increase	the	expression	of	cancer	/	testis	antigens	in	tumors	before	immunotargeting	,	however	,	neither	binding_of_sperm_to_zona_pellucida	,	CALR3	nor	SAGE1	could	be	significantly	induced	in	lung	and	breast	cancer	cell	lines	using	this	strategy	.	.
s1720	Overall	,	the	results	show	that	response_to_radiation	/	ER	-	a	/	miR-191	axis	promotes	breast	cancer_cell	proliferation	and	migration	and	may	serve	as	a	novel	target	for	therapy	.
s569	glycoprotein_catabolic_process_patients	produce	little	or	no	N	-	glycanase	(	Ngly1	)	,	and	the	symptoms	include	global	developmental	delay	,	frequent	seizures	,	complex	hyperkinetic	movement_disorder	,	difficulty	in	swallowing	/	aspiration	,	liver	dysfunction	,	and	a	lack	of	tears	.	.
s3239	However	,	SPRY2	was	not	dysregulated	in	normal	-	hearing	humans	homozygous	for	both	the	GPI_anchor_biosynthetic_process_DFNB26	deafness_variant	and	the	dominant	METTL13	deafness	suppressor	,	indicating	a	plausible	mechanism	of	suppression	.	.
s2038	Therefore	,	it	seems	plausible	that	mutations	in	DMRT2	are	associated	with	a	different	(	novel	)	subtype	of	quaternary_ammonium_group_transport_mainly	characterized	by	severe	rib_anomalies_but	lacking	clear	segmentation	defects	of	the	vertebral	bodies	.
s1042	We	identified	a	novel	locus	at	3p21.31	indexed	by	the	single	nucleotide	polymorphism	(	SNP	)	rs80059929	(	odds	ratio	[	OR	]	=	2.95	,	95	%	confidence	interval	[	CI	]	=	2.17	to	4.02	,	Pmeta	=	6.47	x	10	-	12	)	associated	with	positive_regulation_of_gene_expression	-	amplified	neuroblastoma	,	which	was	replicated	in	127	MYCN	-	amplified	cases	and	254	non	-	high	-	risk	controls	(	OR	=	2.30	,	95	%	CI	=	1.12	to	4.69	,	Preplication	=	.02	)	.	.
s3888	cognition_alterations	affect	ELAV1	expression	and	result	in	reduction	in	the	commissural	axonal	growth	,	thus	affecting	peripheral	and	central_neuronal	function	.	.
s1926	Transcriptomic	analysis	revealed	significant	alterations	in	a	number	of	genes	associated	with	autism	,	such	as	adsl	,	nervous_system_development	,	shank3	,	and	tsc1b	.	.
s2306	To	our	knowledge	,	JU	-	negative_regulation_of_endopeptidase_activity_is	the	first	established	myxoinflammatory	fibroblastic	sarcoma_cell	line	.	.
s3053	Inactivation	of	ALX4/hair_follicle_development_causes	lacrimal_gland_aplasia_in	both	human	and	mouse	.	.
s3631	We	found	that	multiple	oncogenic	tyrosine	kinases	directly	phosphorylated	PDP1	at	melanin_biosynthetic_process-94	,	and	Tyr-94	phosphorylation	of	PDP1	was	common	in	diverse	human	cancer_cells	and	primary	leukemia	cells	from	patients	.	.
s503	In	conclusion	,	we	identified	relevant	genetic	variations	in	up	to	15	%	of	cases	after	exclusion	of	polyglutamine	expansion	spinocerebellar	ataxias	,	and	confirmed	positive_regulation_of_cytosolic_calcium_ion_concentration_and	SPG7	as	major	ataxia	genes	.	.
s2647	Biallelic	microvillus_organization_mutations	have	recently	been	identified	among	infants	with	lethal	congenital	contracture_syndrome	11	(	LCCS11	)	.	.
s454	The	individuals	with	PARS2	and	asparaginyl	-	tRNA_aminoacylation_mutations	,	we	have	reported	here	demonstrate	similar	neurological	features	as	those	previously	reported	,	with	diversity	in	clinical	presentation	such	as	hearing_loss_and	seizure	type	.	.
s2123	Some	genes	,	such	as	glutathione_metabolic_process	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s1033	The	increased	RhoA	-	GTP	results	from	AKT	phosphorylating	three	serines	(	S298	,	S329	,	and	S567	)	in	the	negative_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_tumor_suppressor	,	a	Rho	GTPase	-	activating	protein	(	RhoGAP	)	associated	with	focal	adhesions	.	.
s2774	Using	super	-	resolution	and	electron	microscopy	,	we	find	that	the	human	microcephaly_protein	,	centriole_replication	,	is	recruited	to	the	proximal	end	of	the	procentriole	at	early	S	phase	,	and	is	located	at	the	inner	luminal	walls	of	centrioles	.	.
s2648	Purposeregulation_of_synaptic_vesicle_exocytosis_deficiency	causes	neonatal	hypotonia	,	ptosis	,	neonatal	feeding	difficulties	,	childhood	obesity	,	xerostomia	,	and	growth	hormone	deficiency	.	.
s3006	Our	data	highlight	the	unexpected	X	-	linked	inheritance	of	retinal_degeneration_in	females	caused	by	variants	in	purine_nucleobase_metabolic_process_and	suggest	that	tissue	-	specific	skewed	X	-	inactivation	or	variable	levels	of	pyrophosphate	synthetase-1	deficiency	are	the	underlying	mechanism(s	)	.	.
s1153	CBG	concentration	and	affinity	are	affected	by	a	number	of	common	factors	including	oral	contraceptive	pills	(	OCPs	)	,	fever_and	infection	,	as	well	as	rare	mutations	in	the	serine	protease	inhibitor	A6	(	negative_regulation_of_endopeptidase_activity	)	gene	,	and	as	such	,	total	cortisol	levels	might	not	be	the	ideal	way	to	assess	adrenal	function	in	all	clinical	circumstances	.	.
s1318	Fourteen	different	(	half	of	them	novel	)	non	-	GJB2	variants	causing	HL	were	found	in	10	genes	(	CHD7	,	negative_regulation_of_protein_ubiquitination	,	MITF	,	NEFL	,	OTOF	,	SF3B4	,	SLC26A4	,	TECTA	,	TMPRSS3	,	USH2A	)	among	13	probands	,	confirming	the	genetic	heterogeneity_of	hereditary	HL	.	.
s3735	Mutations	with	milder	presentation	(	homozygous	p	.	D132A	/	rRNA_processing_or	VRK1	)	may	display	additionally	signs	of	upper	motor	neuron	impairment	,	dystonia	or	ataxia_and	die	at	age	between	5	and	18	years	.	.
s2294	In	humans	,	exons	5	-	10	in	CHRNA7	are	duplicated	and	fused	to	the	FAM7A	genetic	element	,	giving	rise	to	the	hybrid	gene	signal_transduction_Its	product	,	dupa7	,	is	a	truncated	subunit	lacking	part	of	the	N	-	terminal	extracellular	ligand	-	binding	domain	and	is	associated	with	neurological	disorders	,	including	schizophrenia	,	and	immunomodulation	.	.
s3560	Eight	of	the	genes	,	APC	,	TP53	,	ATM	,	regulation_of_dendrite_development	,	LRP1B	,	RYR2	,	BIRC6	,	and	MUC17	,	contained	mutations	in	AAAA20	%	of	the	carcinomas	.	.
s163	Here	,	we	identify	new	patients	with	dextrocardia_who	have	mutations	in	CFAP53	,	a	biological_processed	-	coil	domain	containing	protein	.	.
s3660	Altogether	,	these	data	indicate	that	the	NIBP	-	regulated	peripheral_nervous_system_development	-	kB	signaling	pathway	plays	a	pivotal	role	in	the	chemoresistance	of	gastric	cancer_by	promoting	CD133-induced	EMT	.
s931	The	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_of	NOX2	and	ROS	on	cancer_development	is	only	partly	explored	.	.
s2477	Expression	of	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_and	per2	was	significantly	downregulated	in	tumor_tissue	compared	to	adjacent	tissues	.	.
s575	programmed_cell_death2	deletion	accelerated	tumor_formation	in	medulloblastoma	-	prone	ND2,SmoA1	mice	,	indicating	the	disrupting	PKM	releases	CGNPs	from	a	tumor	-	suppressive	effect	.	.
s1315	Finally	,	in	colon	cancer_cells	,	we	prove	that	the	FZD4/phosphorylation_axis	elicited	by	FzM1.8	preserves	stemness	and	promotes	proliferation	of	undifferentiated	cells	.
s1640	Mutations	in	a	number	of	different	genes	causative	for	microcephaly_have	been	identified	,	e.g.	,	MCPH1	,	mitotic_spindle_organization	,	and	ASPM	.	.
s2517	Extensive	search	of	the	literature	revealed	a	potential	key	role	of	genes	at	the	identified	porcine	loci	in	tumor_invasion	(	DST	,	PLEKHA5	,	CBY1	,	LIMK2	and	cellular_response_to_oxidative_stress	)	and	immune	response	modulation	(	ETV5	,	HERC3	and	DICER1	)	of	the	progression	phenotypes	.	.
s3554	Of	the	2	204	genes	that	were	mutated	,	APC	,	TTN	,	TP53	,	KRAS	,	OBSCN	,	SOX9	,	PCDH17	,	negative_regulation_of_inflammatory_response_to_wounding	,	MYH6	,	and	BRD9	were	consistent	with	genes	being	an	early	driver	of	carcinogenesis	,	in	that	they	were	mutated	in	multiple	adenomas	and	multiple	carcinomas	.	.
s1685	Transcriptomics	revealed	that	102	genes	were	upregulated	and	85	genes	were	downregulated	in	hyaluronan_catabolic_process+Lin-	compared	to	CD44-Lin-	cells	in	at	least	3	of	the	5	tumours	sequenced	.	.
s1485	The	BARD1	mutations	also	caused	loss	of	transcriptional	repression	of	BRCA1-regulated	estrogen	metabolism	genes	lipid_hydroxylation_and	CYP3A4	,	breast	epithelial	cells	edited	to	create	heterozygous	loss	of	BARD1	showed	significantly	higher	expression	of	CYP1A1	and	CYP3A4	Reintroduction	of	wild	-	type	BARD1	into	these	cells	restored	CYP1A1	and	CYP3A4	transcription	to	normal	levels	,	but	introduction	of	the	cancer	-	predisposing	BARD1	RING	mutants	failed	to	do	so	.	.
s1875	In	vitro	analysis	revealed	that	knockdown	of	negative_regulation_of_Wnt_signaling_pathway_protein	in	neuroblastoma_cells	results	in	aggregation	of	TRAPPC6AD	,	TIAF1	,	amyloid	b	,	and	Tau	in	a	sequential	manner	.	.
s133	Surprisingly	,	we	detected	no	ADAM2	,	biological_process_and	SAGE1	in	the	67	lung	cancers	(	mainly	non	-	small	lung	cancer	)	and	189	breast	cancers	,	while	MAGE	-	A	proteins	were	present	in	15	%	and	7	-	16	%	of	these	tumor	types	,	respectively	.	.
s743	Hyper	-	methylated	CpG	loci	included	the	known	the	tumor_suppressor	gene	RET	(	p	=	5.72	x	10	-	10	)	,	as	well	as	loci	in	differentially	methylated	regions	for	regulation_of_AMPA_receptor_activity	,	MIR4493	,	NTNG1	,	MCIDAS	,	ZNF568	,	and	RERG	.	.
s2851	After	HDM	challenge	,	these	mice	also	had	fewer	airway	inflammatory	cells	,	reduced	interleukin	(	IL)-5	,	IL-13	,	IL-33	,	tumour_necrosis	factor	(	protein_import_into_nucleus,_translocation	)	and	CXCL1	levels	in	the	lungs	,	and	reduced	IL-5	,	IL-33	and	TNF	levels	in	lung	-	draining	lymph	nodes	.	.
s2626	Meesmann	epithelial	corneal_dystrophy_(MECD	)	is	a	rare	autosomal	dominant	disorder	caused	by	dominant	-	negative	mutations	within	the	KRT3	or	KRT12	genes	,	which	encode	the	cytoskeletal	protein	keratins	K3	and	visual_perception	,	respectively	.	.
s1403	Furthermore	,	we	found	that	tumor_necrosis	factor	(	TNF	)	receptor	-	associated	factor	5	(	positive_regulation_of_DNA	-	binding_transcription_factor_activity	)	and	TGF	-	b	activated	kinase	1	(	MAP3K7	)	binding	protein	1	(	TAB1	)	were	direct	targets	of	miR-873	in	CRC	cells	.	.
s2635	We	present	a	novel	pathogenic	retinoid_metabolic_process_gene	mutation	in	a	16-year	-	old	female	patient	with	symptoms	of	night	blindness	.	.
s1534	Medulloblastoma	(	MB	)	is	the	most	common	malignant	pediatric	brain	tumor	,	and	overactivation	of	the	Sonic	Hedgehog	(	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation	)	signaling	pathway	,	which	requires	the	primary	cilium	,	causes	30	%	of	MBs	.	.
s2161	Germline	and	somatic	Ras_protein_signal_transduction_mutations	have	been	identified	in	Noonan	syndrome	(	NS	)	and	cancer	,	respectively	.	.
s3844	For	non	-	syndromic	pediatric	cataract	,	we	map	a	novel	locus	in	a	multiplex	consanguineous	family	on	4p15.32	where	exome	sequencing	revealed	a	homozygous	truncating	mutation	in	positive_regulation_of_cilium_assembly	.	.
s2067	This	review	summarizes	the	current	knowledge	of	tumorigenesis	and	tumor	progression	in	early	lung	adenocarcinoma	,	with	special	focus	on	its	clinicopathological	characteristics	and	their	associations	with	driver	mutations	(	EGFR	,	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	,	and	BRAF	)	as	well	as	on	its	molecular	pathogenesis	and	progression	.
s2075	In	conclusion	,	we	provide	evidence	that	cellular_response_to_unfolded_protein_promotes	cancer_cell	growth	by	activating	the	ERK	-	CREB	pathway	and	may	serve	as	a	potential	prognostic	factor	in	GC	patients	.
s2019	Loss	of	function	of	substrate_adhesion	-	dependent_cell_spreading_significantly	influenced	cell	proliferation	,	apoptosis	,	and	migration	of	OC	cells	in	vitro	and	tumor_growth	in	vivo	.	.
s3459	In	addition	,	ectopic	peptidyl	-	threonine_phosphorylation_expression	inhibited	gastric	cancer_cell	proliferation	,	migration	and	invasion	,	while	knockdown	of	CDK10	promoted	these	phenotypes	.	.
s2756	The	common	Ser96Ala	human	genetic	variant	of	regulation_of_heart_rate_strongly	correlates	with	life	-	threatening	ventricular_arrhythmias_in	patients	with	idiopathic	dilated	cardiomyopathy	.	.
s2955	Moreover	,	adeno	-	associated	virus	-	mediated	exogenous	expression	of	several	phosphatidylinositol_dephosphorylation_isoforms	ameliorates	the	myopathic	phenotype	owing	to	MTM1	loss	,	with	increased	muscle	force	,	reduced	myofiber	atrophy	,	and	reduction	of	the	intracellular	disorganization	hallmarks	associated	with	myotubular	myopathy	.	.
s2672	Interventions	on	cytoskeletal_anchoring_at_plasma_membrane	-	related	diseases	require	prenatal	surveillance	by	sonography	,	gene	testing	in	high	-	risk	carriers	,	and	proper	orthosis	or	orthopedic	surgeries	to	correct	malformations	including	scoliosis	,	cervical	spine	instability	,	large	joint	dislocation	,	and	clubfoot	.	.
s3147	miR-25	-	3p	,	miR-30a-5p	,	miR-328	and	miR-363	-	3p	directly	targeted	adhesion	-	related	genes	,	including	negative_regulation_of_endodermal_cell_differentiation	,	COL11A1	,	ITGA5	,	MMP16	and	THBS2	.	miR-363	-	3p	and	miR-328	inhibited	proliferation	of	renal	cancer_cells	,	while	miR-25	-	3p	inhibited	adhesion	,	promoted	proliferation	and	migration	of	renal	cancer	cells	.	.
s198	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal	recessive	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	mitochondrial_fission	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy_(SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s2782	We	report	these	cases	to	demonstrate	the	exhaustive	work	-	up	prior	to	finding	the	changes	in	modulation_of_chemical_synaptic_transmission_gene	,	recommend	that	this	gene	be	considered	earlier	in	the	diagnostic	evaluation	of	individuals	with	global	developmental	delay	,	microcephaly	,	and	severe	,	intractable	epilepsy	,	and	support	the	use	of	intellectual_disability_panels	including	IQSEC2	in	the	first	-	line	evaluation	of	these	patients	.
s491	Mutations	in	the	X	-	linked	gene	regulation_of_signal_transduction_have	been	described	in	patients	with	seizures_and	neurodevelopmental	deficits	,	especially	those	affecting	language	.	.
s519	Our	results	suggest	that	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_mutations	cause	a	phenotype	of	severe	myopia_and	significant	articular	involvement	not	previously	described	in	Larsen	syndrome	.
s2211	BACKGROUND	The	aim	of	this	study	was	to	investigate	the	prognostic	relevance	of	nucleus_organization_in	lung	cancer_(LC	)	.	.
s1376	The	contiguous	deletion	of	NDP	and	its	neighbouring	genes	,	cellular_biogenic_amine_metabolic_process	/	B	and	EFHC2	,	reportedly	leads	to	syndromic	clinical	features	such	as	microcephaly	,	intellectual	disability	,	and	epilepsy	.	.
s478	Here	,	we	demonstrate	that	mice	with	conditional	ablation	of	the	sensory_perception_of_sound_gene	in	all	sensory	hair	cells	or	only	in	outer	hair	cells	(	OHCs	)	show	similar	auditory	phenotypes	with	early	-	onset	profound	hearing_loss	.	.
s18	A	homozygous	mutation	of	negative_regulation_of_endopeptidase_activity	,	a	gene	encoding	an	intracellular	protease	inhibitor	,	has	recently	been	associated	with	post	-	lingual	,	autosomal	-	recessive	,	nonsyndromic	hearing_loss_in	humans	(	DFNB91	)	.	.
s1592	A	number	of	studies	report	that	miRNAs	are	involved	in	homeostatic	maintenance	such	as	cell	cycle	regulation	,	cell	division	and	apoptosis	,	and	that	aberrant	expression	of	miRNAs	is	often	detected	in	various	types	of	diprotein_glycosylationases	,	including	cancer	.	.
s2939	Two	pairwise	genetic	interactions	(	B	cell	lymphocyte	kinase	(	B_cell_receptor_signaling_pathway	)	rs13277113,B	cell	scaffold	protein	with	ankyrin	repeats	1	(	BANK1	)	rs3733197and	BLK	rs13277113	membrane	metalloendopeptidase	like	1	(	MMEL1)/	tumor_necrosis	factor	receptor	superfamily	member	14	(	TNFRSF14	)	rs3890745	)	have	been	demonstrated	in	determining	susceptibility	to	rheumatoid	arthritis	(	RA	)	without	replication	,	thus	this	study	was	performed	to	examine	whether	abovementioned	genetic	polymorphisms	were	associated	with	RA	and	further	tests	were	performed	to	see	whether	aforementioned	genetic	interactions	existed	in	RA	among	Chinese	population	.	.
s550	Recent	GWAS	completed	for	three	types	of	common	adult	-	onset	glaucoma_have	identified	novel	loci	for	POAG	(	primary	-	open	-	angle	glaucoma	)	(	ABCA1	,	regulation_of_signal_transduction	,	GMDS	,	PMM2	,	TGFBR3	,	FNDC3B	,	ARHGEF12	,	GAS7	,	FOXC1	,	ATXN2	,	TXNRD2	)	,	PACG	(	primary	angle	-	closure	glaucoma	(	EPDR1	,	CHAT	,	GLIS3	,	FERMT2	,	DPM2-FAM102	)	,	and	exfoliation	syndrome	(	XFS	)	glaucoma	(	CACNA1A	)	.	.
s1470	In	the	present	study	,	the	results	obtained	from	our	previously	published	methylation	array	were	analyzed	and	10	candidate	genes	involved	in	DNA	repair	[	protein	phosphatase	4	catalytic	subunit	(	PPP4C	)	]	,	apoptosis	[	runt	related	transcription	factor	3	(	RUNX3	)	,	interferon	regulatory	factor	4	(	IRF4	)	,	ubiquitin	C	-	terminal	hydrolase	L1	(	protein_deubiquitination	)	and	tumor_protein	p53	inducible	protein	3	(	TP53I3	)	]	,	cell	proliferation	[	cyclin	D2	(	CCND2	)	and	Ras	association	domain	family	member	1	(	RASSF1	)	]	,	drug	metabolism	[	aldehyde	dehydrogenase	1	family	member	A3	(	ALDH1A3	)	and	solute	carrier	family	29	member	1	(	SLC29A1	)	]	and	angiogenesis	[	human	immunodeficiency	virus-1	tat	interactive	protein	2	(	HTATIP2	)	]	were	selected	for	quantification	of	their	methylation	levels	in	54	CCA	and	19	adjacent	normal	tissues	using	methylation	-	sensitive	high	-	resolution	melting	.	.
s3192	Our	cases	confirm	that	cellular_sodium_ion_homeostasis	-	related	neurological	disorders	make	up	a	phenotypic	continuum	rather	than	overlapping	syndromes	,	in	which	early	onset	dystonia	,	ataxia_and	paroxysmal	episodes	with	triggering	or	worsening	factors	are	key	diagnostic	clues	.	.
s242	Recently	,	mutations	in	transmembrane	protein	240	(	biological_process	)	were	identified	as	the	cause	of	spinocerebellar	ataxia_type	21	(	SCA21	)	in	several	French	families	.	.
s1814	We	studied	the	expression	of	biological_process_and	its	effect	on	cytokine	secretion	in	tumor_necrosis	factor	-	alpha	(	TNF	-	a)-induced	LX-2	cells	.	.
s1924	Though	a	rare	etiology	,	cell_junction_assembly_gene	should	not	be	excluded	in	early	-	onset	arrhythmia	,	even	in	the	absence	of	myopathy	,	which	occurs	later	in	the	disease	course	.
s1688	Ribosome	profiling	and	RNA	sequencing	identified	membrane_protein_proteolysis_as	a	principle	node	for	gene	expression	regulation	downstream	from	LIN28B	In	vitro	and	in	vivo	data	demonstrate	that	epithelial	IMP1	loss	increases	expression	of	WNT	target	genes	and	enhances	LIN28B	-	mediated	intestinal	tumorigenesis	,	which	was	reversed	when	we	overexpressed	IMP1	independently	in	vivo	.	.
s1772	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	spermatid_development_and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s1609	Epigenome	silencing	of	these	repeat	sites	does	not	affect	gene	expression	in	unrelated	cells	,	can	prevent	the	induction	of	gene	expression	by	EWS	-	multicellular_organism_development	,	and	,	in	the	case	of	a	GGAA	repeat	that	controls	SOX2	expression	from	a	distance	of	470	kb	,	is	sufficient	to	impair	the	growth	of	Ewing	sarcoma_xenografts	.	.
s1759	In	addition	,	several	studies	have	demonstrated	that	detection_of_calcium_ion_dysfunction	may	be	associated	with	some	fatal	vascular	diseases	,	such	as	pulmonary	arterial	hypertension	,	primary	hypertension	,	diabetes	,	acute	myocardial	infarction	and	vascular_calcification	.	.
s1918	On	the	other	hand	,	growing	tumors	evade	immune	surveillance	by	exploiting	co	-	inhibitory	signaling	through	expression	of	negative_regulation_of_regulatory_T_cell_differentiation	,	PD1	and	PDL-1	.	.
s1107	Thus	,	it	is	clear	that	a	more	complex	genetic	network	of	cancer	-	associated	genes	than	previously	hypothesized	is	involved	in	BCC	carcinogenesis	,	with	a	potential	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_on	the	development	of	new	molecular	targeted	therapies	.	.
s3530	intrinsic_apoptotic_signaling_pathway_in_response_to_oxidative_stress	/	DIABLO	expression	is	markedly	different	between	drug	-	resistant	and	chemo	sensitive	tumor_cells	.	.
s2210	Given	the	lack	of	specific	targeted	genes	and	pathways	known	to	be	involved	in	tumour_cell	dormancy	,	we	proposed	enriched	candidate	genes	related	to	the	negative	regulation	of	cell	proliferation	,	signalling	pathways	regulating	pluripotency	of	stem	cells	and	neuroactive	ligand	-	receptor	interaction	,	and	3	hub	genes	(	FTH1	,	GRM1	and	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	)	.	.
s1856	We	found	that	LGR5	expression	in	the	epithelium	and	stroma	was	associated	with	tumor_stage	,	and	by	integrating	functional	experiments	with	LGR5-sorted	cell	RNA	sequencing	data	from	adenoma	and	normal	organoids	,	we	found	correlations	between	LGR5	and	CRC	-	specific	genes	,	including	dickkopf	WNT	signaling	pathway	inhibitor	4	(	DKK4	)	and	SPARC	-	related	modular	calcium	binding	2	(	positive_regulation_of_endothelial_cell_migration	)	.	.
s1093	Variations	in	RNA_catabolic_process_cause	an	autosomal_recessive_form	of	AGS	.	.
s169	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal_recessive_Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/protein_targeting_to_mitochondrion	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy	(	SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s3060	An	increased	ISG	expression	was	also	induced	by	adenosine_to_inosine_editing_and	RNASEH2B	variants	in	tumor_cells	and	was	blocked	by	the	JAK	inhibitor	Ruxolitinib	.	.
s1977	The	immunohistochemical	expression	of	cell	-	matrix_adhesion_in	corresponding	tissue	was	significantly	higher	in	metastases	than	in	glioblastomas	.	The	present	study	demonstrates	high	levels	of	L1CAM	in	cyst	fluid	of	glioblastoma	and	metastatic	brain	tumors	.	.
s44	Heterozygous	intermediate_filament_cytoskeleton_organization_mutations	have	previously	been	associated	with	autosomal	dominant	woolly	hair	/	hypotrichosis_simplex	(	ADWH	)	.	.
s4019	Methods	We	identified	all	materials	published	mentioning	both	protein_neddylation_and	allergic	rhinitis	(	AR	)	,	chronic	sinusitis	,	asthma	,	and	atopic_dermatitis_(AD	)	that	are	indexed	on	PubMed	,	Google	,	or	the	ProQuest	Central	databases	.	.
s1895	Heterozygous	de	novo	NALCN	missense	variants	in	the	translation	/	S6	pore	-	forming	segments	lead	to	congenital	contractures_of	the	limbs	and	face	,	hypotonia	,	and	developmental	delay	(	CLIFAHDD	,	OMIM	616266	)	with	some	clinical	overlap	.	.
s3846	We	report	two	further	candidates	that	are	biallelically	inactivated	each	in	a	single	cataract_family	,	TAF1A	(	cataract	with	global	developmental	delay	)	and	biological_process_(non	-	syndromic	cataract	)	.	.
s3242	Constitutive	activation	of	interferon	signaling	pathways	has	been	reported	in	colorectal	cancer_(CRC	)	,	leading	to	a	strong	CD8	+	T	cell	response	through	stimulation	of	negative_regulation_of_NF	-	kappaB_transcription_factor_activity_expression	.	.
s1960	Analysis	of	the	expression	of	the	central	protein_acetylation_genes	over	a	24	-	36	hour	period	in	multiple	peripheral	tissues	including	fracture	callus	,	proximal	tibia	growth	plate	and	cardiac	tissues	after	12	days	on	a	low	phosphate	diet	showed	higher	levels	of	gene	expression	in	the	hypophosphatemia_groups	(	p	AAAA	0.001	)	and	a	3	to	6	hour	elongation	of	the	circadian	cycle	.	.
s2561	Expectedly	,	the	analysis	of	the	DEGs	common	to	all	three	alterations	highlighted	a	group	of	BioFunctions	that	included	Cell	Proliferation	of	tumor	cell	lines	(	14	DEGs	)	,	Invasion	of	cells	(	10	DEGs	)	and	Migration	of	tumour_cell	lines	(	10	DEGs	)	,	with	a	common	core	of	5	genes	(	ATF3	,	G1/S_transition_of_mitotic_cell_cycle	,	GDF15	,	HBEGF	and	LCN2	)	that	likely	represent	downstream	effectors	of	the	pro	-	oncogenic	activities	of	PI3K	/	AKT	signalling	.	.
s992	Heparanase	(	cell	-	matrix_adhesion	)	expression	was	identified	in	50	%	of	GBM	tumours	by	immunostaining	,	and	was	characterised	by	a	high	intratumoural	heterogeneity	of	the	presence	of	the	HPSE	protein	.	.
s2730	However	,	certain	chromatin	remodeling	genes	(	MLL1	,	MLL2	,	MLL3	,	BAP1	,	PBRM1	,	EED	,	and	ATRX	)	were	found	to	be	mutated	in	7/22	(	32	%	)	of	intraductal	tubulopapillary	neoplasms	and	27	%	harbored	phosphatidylinositol	3-kinase	(	PI3	K	)	pathway	(	PIK3CA	,	phosphorylation	,	INPP4A	,	and	PTEN	)	mutations	.	.
s1654	Immunostaining	showed	that	the	colon	cancer_was	positive	for	CDX2	,	SATB2	,	had	a	loss	of	mismatch_repair_and	intact	expression	of	MLH1	,	MSH2	and	MSH6	,	negative	for	AMACR	,	while	the	prostate	cancer	was	positive	for	AMACR	,	had	intact	expression	of	PMS2	,	MLH1	,	MSH2	and	MSH6	,	and	negative	for	CDX2	and	SATB2	.	.
s270	Among	them	four	novel	fusion	genes	SEPT9/CYHR	,	IGF1R	/	TTC23	,	regulation_of_dopamine_secretion	/	TNNI2	and	CASZ1/DFFA	were	validated	and	characterized	in	48	formalin	-	fixed	paraffin	-	embedded	(	FFPE	)	specimens	of	bladder	cancer	.	.
s3393	Taken	together	,	our	data	indicate	that	sex_determination_may	serve	as	an	oncogene	in	osteosarcoma	,	and	SOX3	downregulation	may	prove	to	be	a	novel	approach	for	the	inhibition	of	osteosarcoma	progression	.
s4024	The	roles	and	model	of	action	of	the	chromatin	assembly	complex	factor-1B	(	DNA_replication	-	dependent_nucleosome_assembly	)	gene	in	liver	cancer_have	not	been	fully	elucidated	.	.
s3248	These	results	increase	our	knowledge	about	the	RAD51C	and	strand_invasion_mutation	spectrum	and	support	the	notion	that	these	genes	should	be	included	in	the	gene	panel	testing	performed	on	patients	with	hereditary	breast	and	ovarian	cancer_syndrome	.
s1288	We	recently	found	that	DDHD2	is	a	principal	triglyceride	hydrolase	in	the	central_nervous	system	(	CNS	)	and	that	genetic	deletion	of	this	enzyme	in	mice	leads	to	ectopic	lipid	droplet	(	positive_regulation_of_macroautophagy	)	accumulation	in	neurons	throughout	the	brain	.	.
s2855	icosanoid_metabolic_process_mutations	result	in	Ghosal	hematodiaphyseal	dysplasia	(	OMIM	231095	)	,	the	autosomal	recessive	syndrome	associated	with	abnormal_bone_structure_and	BMF	.	.
s3612	Therefore	,	in	this	study	,	we	examined	the	roles	of	outer_dynein_arm_assembly_using	Zmynd10-/-mice	exhibiting	typical	PCD	phenotypes	,	including	hydrocephalus_and	laterality	defects	.	.
s3804	We	evaluated	sensory_perception_of_sound_variants	from	a	cohort	of	951	individuals	with	exome	sequencing	who	were	not	ascertained	for	hearing_loss	.	.
s1746	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	cell	-	matrix_adhesion_and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s2556	Expectedly	,	the	analysis	of	the	DEGs	common	to	all	three	alterations	highlighted	a	group	of	BioFunctions	that	included	Cell	Proliferation	of	tumor_cell	lines	(	14	DEGs	)	,	Invasion	of	cells	(	10	DEGs	)	and	Migration	of	tumour	cell	lines	(	10	DEGs	)	,	with	a	common	core	of	5	genes	(	ATF3	,	CDKN1A	,	GDF15	,	epidermal_growth_factor_receptor_signaling_pathway_and	LCN2	)	that	likely	represent	downstream	effectors	of	the	pro	-	oncogenic	activities	of	PI3K	/	AKT	signalling	.	.
s2906	The	present	study	also	identified	in	tumor_and	potentially	malignant	lesions	common	alterations	of	chromosomal	regions	and	genes	,	including	FBXL5	,	cellular_glucuronidation	,	UGT2B28	,	KANSL1	,	GSTT1	and	DUSP22	,	being	some	of	these	typical	aberrations	described	in	oral	cancer	and	others	are	linked	to	chemoradioresistance	.	.
s827	Our	findings	revealed	that	both	proline_biosynthetic_process_mRNA	and	protein	expression	were	significantly	associated	with	tumor_size	,	grade	and	invasive	molecular	subtypes	of	breast	cancers	.	.
s3644	For	the	first	time	,	to	the	best	of	our	knowledge	,	the	present	study	confirmed	that	fatty_acid_metabolic_process_was	a	novel	oncogene	in	liver	cancer	.	.
s1624	Furthermore	,	since	adipocytes	provide	the	largest	storage	depot	for	TG	and	play	a	crucial	role	in	the	development	of	obesity	,	we	could	infer	that	triglyceride_metabolic_process_also	acts	as	a	novel	regulator	to	modulate	TG	storage	in	adipocytes	.	.
s1985	We	found	that	blocking	IL6	signaling	in	alcohol	fed	mice	reducedthe	number	of	tumorsand	liver	proliferation	in	wild	type	mice	but	not	in	knockout	mice	suggesting	that	reduced	IL6	in	histone_methylation_knockout	mice	contributes	to	the	protection	from	alcohol	.	.
s871	Metabolic	cutis	laxa	results	from	Menkes	syndrome	,	caused	by	a	defect	in	the	ATPase	copper	transporting	alpha	(	ATP7A	)	gene	,	congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	due	to	mutations	in	subunit	7	of	the	component	of	oligomeric	Golgi	(	COG7)-congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	(	CDG	)	complex	,	combined	disorder	of	N-	and	O	-	linked	glycosylation	,	due	to	mutations	in	ATPase	H+	transporting	V0	subunit	a2	(	ATP6VOA2	)	gene	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	reductase	1	deficiency	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	synthase	deficiency	,	macrocephaly	,	alopecia	,	cutis	laxa	,	and	scoliosis_(MACS	)	syndrome	,	due	to	Ras	and	Rab	interactor	2	(	RIN2	)	mutations	,	transaldolase	deficiency	caused	by	mutations	in	the	transaldolase	1	(	TALDO1	)	gene	,	Gerodermia	osteodysplastica	due	to	mutations	in	the	golgin	,	RAB6-interacting	(	GORAB	or	SCYL1BP1	)	gene	,	and	mitogen	-	activated	pathway	(	MAP	)	kinase	defects	,	caused	by	mutations	in	several	genes	[	protein	tyrosine	phosphatase	,	non	-	receptor	-	type	11	(	PTPN11	)	,	RAF	,	NF	,	HRas	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	HRAS	)	,	B	-	Raf	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	protein_phosphorylation	)	,	MEK1/2	,	KRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	KRAS	)	,	SOS	Ras	/	Rho	guanine	nucleotide	exchange	factor	2	(	SOS2	)	,	leucine	rich	repeat	scaffold	protein	(	SHOC2	)	,	NRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	NRAS	)	,	and	Raf-1	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	RAF1	)	]	,	which	regulate	the	Ras	-	MAPK	cascade	.	.
s3123	These	include	the	perinatal	lethal	short	-	rib	polydactyly_syndromes	(	SRPS	)	and	the	less	severe	asphyxiating	thoracic	dystrophy	(	ATD	)	,	Ellis	-	glycoprotein_biosynthetic_process_Creveld	(	EVC	)	syndrome	,	and	cranioectodermal	dysplasia	(	CED	)	phenotypes	.	.
s599	Recent	prevalent	research	topic	concentrated	in	the	three	neighboring	genes	of	FTO	,	RrelationIP1L,_energy_homeostasis	and	IRX5	,	as	having	a	functional	link	between_obesity	-	associated	common	variants	within	FTO	and	the	observed	human	phenotypes	.	.
s1385	Our	data	,	for	the	first	time	,	functionally	link	Jalili	syndrome	gene	CNNM4	to	LCA	gene	photoreceptor_cell_maintenance	,	providing	important	insights	into	the	molecular	pathogenic	mechanism	of	retinal_dystrophy_in	Jalili	syndrome	.
s310	Bardet	-	Biedl	syndrome	(	visual_perception	)	is	a	genetically	heterogeneous	disorder	characterized	by	retinal	dystrophy	,	polydactyly	,	obesity	,	developmental_delay	,	and	renal	defects	.	.
s3106	In	summary	,	a	15-lncRNA	expression	signature	(	BAIAP2-AS1	,	RP11	-	203J24.8	,	LINC01133	,	positive_regulation_of_ARF_protein_signal_transduction-7G5.6	,	RP11	-	147L13.15	,	SERHL	,	CTC-537E7.3	,	RP11	-	440L14.1	,	RP11	-	131N11.4	,	ILF3-AS1	,	RP11	-	80H18.4	,	RP11	-	1096G20.5	,	CTD-2192J16.26	,	RP11	-	621L6.3	,	and	RP11	-	571M6.18	)	were	identified	and	validated	which	can	predict	cervical	cancer_patient	survival	.	.
s2625	Meesmann	epithelial	corneal_dystrophy_(MECD	)	is	a	rare	autosomal	dominant	disorder	caused	by	dominant	-	negative	mutations	within	the	KRT3	or	visual_perception_genes	,	which	encode	the	cytoskeletal	protein	keratins	K3	and	K12	,	respectively	.	.
s1902	The	tumor_samples	were	divided	into	three	groups	depending	on	the	aortic_valve_morphogenesis_expression	level	.	.
s4018	Of	the	2	204	genes	that	were	mutated	,	APC	,	TTN	,	TP53	,	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	,	OBSCN	,	SOX9	,	PCDH17	,	SIGLEC10	,	MYH6	,	and	BRD9	were	consistent	with	genes	being	an	early	driver	of	carcinogenesis	,	in	that	they	were	mutated	in	multiple	adenomas	and	multiple	carcinomas	.	.
s2179	This	result	suggests	that	COL4A3	and	glomerular_basement_membrane_development_digenic	mutations	in	cis	mimicking	an	autosomal	dominant	inheritance_should	be	considered	as	a	novel	inheritance	pattern	of	benign	familial	hematuria	,	although	the	disease	-	causing	mechanism	remains	unknown	.
s2687	Five	genes	,	including	OTOGL	,	PLCB4	,	SCEL	,	proteolysis	,	and	WWOX	,	have	CNVs	in	the	six	patients	with	sporadic_HBs	,	and	three	genes	,	including	ABCA6	,	CWC27	,	and	LAMA2	,	have	CNVs	in	the	five	patients	with	familial	HBs	.	.
s2011	Importantly	,	bone	cell	activity	was	inversely	correlated	to	tumor_cell	AR	activity	(	measured	as	AR	,	FOXA1	,	HOXB13	,	KLK2	,	KLK3	,	NKX3	-	1	,	STEAP2	,	and	proteolysis_expression	)	and	to	patient	serum	prostate	-	specific	antigen	(	PSA	)	levels	.	.
s1655	Immunostaining	showed	that	the	colon	cancer_was	positive	for	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	SATB2	,	had	a	loss	of	PMS2	and	intact	expression	of	MLH1	,	MSH2	and	MSH6	,	negative	for	AMACR	,	while	the	prostate	cancer	was	positive	for	AMACR	,	had	intact	expression	of	PMS2	,	MLH1	,	MSH2	and	MSH6	,	and	negative	for	CDX2	and	SATB2	.	.
s3573	Methods	,	Quantitative	real	-	time	polymerase	chain	reaction	(	qRT	-	PCR	)	was	applied	to	detect	the	expression	level	of	HOXA11-AS	in	cell	lines	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II-1A	,	EC9706	,	EC109	,	and	in	tumor_tissue	and	paired	adjacent	tissue	samples	from	73	ESCC	patients	who	received	surgical	resection	.	The	correlations	of	the	expression	level	of	HOXA11-AS	with	clinicopathological	features	and	prognosis	were	also	analyzed	.	.
s866	Metabolic	cutis	laxa	results	from	Menkes	syndrome	,	caused	by	a	defect	in	the	ATPase	copper	transporting	alpha	(	ATP7A	)	gene	,	congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	due	to	mutations	in	subunit	7	of	the	component	of	oligomeric	Golgi	(	COG7)-congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	(	CDG	)	complex	,	combined	disorder	of	N-	and	O	-	linked	glycosylation	,	due	to	mutations	in	ATPase	H+	transporting	V0	subunit	a2	(	ATP6VOA2	)	gene	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	reductase	1	deficiency	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	synthase	deficiency	,	macrocephaly	,	alopecia	,	cutis	laxa	,	and	scoliosis_(MACS	)	syndrome	,	due	to	Ras	and	Rab	interactor	2	(	RIN2	)	mutations	,	transaldolase	deficiency	caused	by	mutations	in	the	transaldolase	1	(	TALDO1	)	gene	,	Gerodermia	osteodysplastica	due	to	mutations	in	the	golgin	,	peptidyl	-	cysteine_methylation	-	interacting	(	GORAB	or	SCYL1BP1	)	gene	,	and	mitogen	-	activated	pathway	(	MAP	)	kinase	defects	,	caused	by	mutations	in	several	genes	[	protein	tyrosine	phosphatase	,	non	-	receptor	-	type	11	(	PTPN11	)	,	RAF	,	NF	,	HRas	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	HRAS	)	,	B	-	Raf	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	BRAF	)	,	MEK1/2	,	KRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	KRAS	)	,	SOS	Ras	/	Rho	guanine	nucleotide	exchange	factor	2	(	SOS2	)	,	leucine	rich	repeat	scaffold	protein	(	SHOC2	)	,	NRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	NRAS	)	,	and	Raf-1	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	RAF1	)	]	,	which	regulate	the	Ras	-	MAPK	cascade	.	.
s3451	In	addition	,	the	analysis	of	upstream	miRNAs	showed	that	FOXF1	adjacent	non	-	coding	developmental	regulatory	RNA	(	FENDRR	)	had	common	upstream	miRNAs	,	including	miR-18b-5p	,	with	another	119	differentially	expressed	genes	,	and	that	FENDRR	was	co	-	expressed	with	adenomatosis	polyposis	coli	downregulated	1	(	APCDD1	)	and	v	-	kit	Hardy	-	Zuckerman	4	feline	sarcoma_viral	oncogene	homolog	(	activation_of_MAPK_activity	)	.	.
s2136	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	biological_process	,	TEKT4	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s1194	In	particular	,	MYH9	mutations	result	in	congenital	macrothrombocytopenia_and	predispose	to	kidney	failure	,	hearing	loss	,	and	cataracts	,	cell_surface_receptor_signaling_pathway_and	MECOM	mutations	cause	congenital	thrombocytopenia	evolving	into	bone	marrow	failure	,	whereas	thrombocytopenias	caused	by	RUNX1	,	ANKRD26	,	and	ETV6	mutations	are	characterized	by	predisposition	to	hematological	malignancies	.	.
s1819	This	mouse	line	is	an	excellent	model	for	studying	protein_autophosphorylation	-	type	deafness_in	humans	.
s3280	The	data	showed	that	interfering	PSMB8	may	inhibit	the	migration	and	proliferation	of	glioma_cells	by	reducing	expression	of	cyclin	A	,	cyclin	B1	,	cyclin	D1	,	Vimentin	,	and	N	-	integrin	-	mediated_signaling_pathway	,	and	by	increasing	expression	of	E	-	cadherin	.	.
s2595	Genetic	studies	on	consanguineous	families	with	primary	microcephaly_have	identified	15	(	MCPH	)	causative	genes	that	include	MCPH1	,	WDR62	,	CDK5RAP2	,	CASC5	,	ASPM	,	CENPJ	,	STIL	,	CEP135	,	CEP152	,	ZNF335	,	PHC1	,	CDK6	,	CENPE	,	SASS6	MFSD2A	central_nervous_system_development_and	CIT	(	Khan	et	al	.	2014	,	Yamamoto	et	al	.	2014	,	Alakbarzade	et	al	.	2015,Morris	-	Rosendahl	and	Kaindl	2015	,	Basit	et	al	.	2016	)	.	.
s3220	The	roles	of	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_in	human	breast	cancer_remains	elusive	.	.
s3569	Objective	,	To	explore	the	expression	of	long	noncoding	RNA	(	lncRNA	)	skeletal_system_development	-	AS	in	esophageal	squamous_cell_carcinoma_tissues	and	the	relationship	of	HOXA11-AS	level	with	clinical	outcomes	.	.
s3996	We	further	review	the	variety	of	melanocytic	tumors	associated	with	such	protein_phosphorylation_fusions	.
s3634	Moreover	,	expression	of	a	phosphorylation	-	deficient	peptidyl	-	threonine_dephosphorylation_Y94F	mutant	in	cancer	cells	resulted	in	increased	oxidative	phosphorylation	,	decreased	cell	proliferation	under	hypoxia	,	and	reduced	tumor_growth	in	mice	.	.
s1571	Molecular	analyses	showed	mutations	of	exon	3	of	negative_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_in	more	than	half	of	these	tumors	,	and	nuclear	accumulation	of	b	-	catenin	and	over	expression	of	cyclin	D1	can	be	useful	for	the	differential	diagnosis	of	SCT	,	NOS	.
s3549	In	these	5	families	,	we	detected	one	reported	and	six	novel	mutations	in	5	different	deafness	autosomal_recessive_(DFNB	)	genes	(	TRIOBP	,	LHFPL5	,	CDH23	,	PCDH15	,	and	lysosome_organization	)	.	.
s1667	Here	,	we	show	that	the	autophagic	tumor_suppressor	regulation_of_protein_serine	/	threonine_kinase_activity_plays	an	integral	role	in	melanogenesis	by	interaction	with	the	biogenesis	of	lysosome	-	related	organelles	complex	1	(	BLOC-1	)	.	.
s1608	Epigenome	silencing	of	these	repeat	sites	does	not	affect	gene	expression	in	unrelated	cells	,	can	prevent	the	induction	of	gene	expression	by	regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	-	FLI1	,	and	,	in	the	case	of	a	GGAA	repeat	that	controls	SOX2	expression	from	a	distance	of	470	kb	,	is	sufficient	to	impair	the	growth	of	Ewing	sarcoma_xenografts	.	.
s838	Therefore	,	we	concluded	that	morphogenesis_of_a_polarized_epithelium_c.3257AAAAAG	and	NEB	c.914	AAAAAG	were	potential	causal	variants	in	this	strabismus_pedigree	.	.
s3893	The	aberrant	expression	or	alteration	of	microRNAs	(	protein_polyubiquitinationNAs	/	miRs	)	contributes	to	the	development	and	progression	of	cancer	.	.
s2601	Oral	and	pharyngeal	cancers	combined	were	associated	with	loci	at	6p21.32	(	rs3828805	,	HLA	-	DQB1	)	,	10q26.13	(	rs201982221	,	phosphate	-	containing_compound_metabolic_process	)	and	11p15.4	(	rs1453414	,	OR52N2-TRIM5	)	.	.
s2900	The	present	study	also	identified	in	tumor	and	potentially	malignant	lesions	common	alterations	of	chromosomal	regions	and	genes	,	including	protein_ubiquitination	,	UGT2B15	,	UGT2B28	,	KANSL1	,	GSTT1	and	DUSP22	,	being	some	of	these	typical	aberrations	described	in	oral	cancer_and	others	are	linked	to	chemoradioresistance	.	.
s1498	The	Random	Forest	algorithm	selected	FGFR2	,	cellular_response_to_mechanical_stimulus_and	age	as	important	breast	cancer_predictors	.	.
s63	The	created	databases	include	branched	-	chain_amino_acid_catabolic_process_(isobutyryl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	deficiency	(	IBD	)	)	,	ACADSB	(	short	-	chain	acyl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	(	SCAD	)	deficiency	)	,	AUH	(	3-methylglutaconic	aciduria	(	3-MGCA	)	)	,	DHCR7	(	Smith	-	Lemli	-	Opitz	syndrome	)	,	HMGCS2	(	3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl	-	CoA	synthase	2	deficiency	)	,	HSD17B10	(	17-beta	-	hydroxysteroid	dehydrogenase	X	deficiency	)	,	FKBP14	(	Ehlers	-	Danlos	syndrome	with	progressive	kyphoscoliosis	,	myopathy	,	and	hearing_loss	,	EDSKMH	)	and	ROGDI	(	Kohlschutter	-	Tonz	syndrome	)	.	.
s139	Treatment	with	DNA	methyltransferase	inhibitors	has	been	proposed	as	an	attractive	strategy	to	increase	the	expression	of	cancer	/	testis	antigens	in	tumors	before	immunotargeting	,	however	,	neither	ADAM2	,	biological_process_nor	SAGE1	could	be	significantly	induced	in	lung	and	breast	cancer	cell	lines	using	this	strategy	.	.
s1673	Mutations	in	anterograde_neuronal_dense_core_vesicle_transport_are	responsible	for	autosomal	recessive	spastic	paraplegia_type	58	(	SPG58	)	and	spastic	ataxia	2	(	SPAX2	)	.	.
s303	We	report	a	boy	with	intellectual_disability_carrying	two	de	novo	missense	mutations	in	the	last	exon	of	positive_regulation_of_glycolytic_process_(Ser616Phe	and	Gly741Arg	,	both	previously	unreported	)	.	.
s358	Missense	mutations	in	the	mitochondrial	seryl	-	tRNA	synthetase	gene	,	seryl	-	tRNA_aminoacylation	,	have	been	identified	in	HUPRA	syndrome	(	hyperuricemia	,	pulmonary	hypertension	,	renal	failure	in	infancy	,	and	alkalosis	)	.	.
s1610	Epigenome	silencing	of	these	repeat	sites	does	not	affect	gene	expression	in	unrelated	cells	,	can	prevent	the	induction	of	gene	expression	by	EWS	-	FLI1	,	and	,	in	the	case	of	a	GGAA	repeat	that	controls	osteoblast_differentiation_expression	from	a	distance	of	470	kb	,	is	sufficient	to	impair	the	growth	of	Ewing	sarcoma_xenografts	.	.
s2482	Low	expression	of	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	-	a	in	tumor_correlated	with	better	survival	in	men	but	not	in	women	.	.
s3034	A	bioinformatic	analysis	of	the	open	RNA	-	Seq	database	from	The	Cancer	Genome	Atlas	(	TCGA	)	liver	hepatocellular_carcinoma_(LIHC	)	cohort	revealed	a	significant	negative	correlation	between	MRPL13	and	protein_depalmitoylation_expression	.	.
s2894	Top	10	genes	in	the	brown	module	,	including	EGF	containing	fibulin	like	extracellular	matrix	protein	2	(	EFEMP2	)	,	fibrillin	1	(	cell_adhesion_mediated_by_integrin	)	and	secreted	protein	acidic	and	cysteine	rich	(	SPARC	)	were	also	associated	with	survival	time	of	colon	cancer_patients	.	.
s1086	In	this	subset	of	extra	-	hepatic	cancers	,	MAT2A	and	S	-	adenosylmethionine_biosynthetic_process_are	induced	via	different	regulatory	mechanisms	.	.
s1208	The	most	common	genetic	cause	is	cell	-	matrix_adhesion	-	related	X	-	linked	hydrocephalus_and	that	explains	only	5%-10	%	of	all	male	cases	.	.
s77	Mutations	in	the	membrane	frizzled	-	related	protein	(	MFRP	/	Mfrp	)	gene	,	specifically	expressed	in	the	retinal	pigment	epithelium	(	carbohydrate_metabolic_process	)	and	ciliary	body	,	cause	nanophthalmia	or	posterior	microphthalmia_with	retinitis	pigmentosa	in	humans	,	and	photoreceptor	degeneration	in	mice	.	.
s1845	isoprenoid_biosynthetic_process_can	be	improved	through	weight	loss	(	in	obesity	)	and	through	exercise	.	.
s3240	However	,	SPRY2	was	not	dysregulated	in	normal	-	hearing	humans	homozygous	for	both	the	GAB1	DFNB26	deafness_variant	and	the	dominant	endothelial_cell_morphogenesisTL13	deafness	suppressor	,	indicating	a	plausible	mechanism	of	suppression	.	.

s2493	CHD	proteins	play	an	important	role	in	neurodevelopment	,	as	pathogenic	variants	in	CHD1	,	muscle_organ_development	,	CHD4	,	CHD7	and	CHD8	have	been	associated	with	a	range	of	neurological	phenotypes	,	including	autism_spectrum	disorder	(	ASD	)	,	intellectual	disability	(	ID	)	and	epilepsy	.	.
s1302	Low	mitochondrial_pyruvate_transmembrane_transport_expression	correlated	with	poor	ICC	prognosis	and	was	correlated	with	tumor_invasion	and	distant	metastasis	.	.
s2564	Here	,	we	report	that	in	prostate	cancer_cells	(	PCCs	)	microRNAs	(	miRNAs	)	greatly	contribute	to	deregulation	of	mitochondrial	fatty	acid	(	regulation_of_ferrochelatase_activity	)	oxidation	via	carnitine	system	modulation	.	.
s1460	Pre	-	NACT	core	needle	biopsies	and	postoperative	tumor_samples	were	immunohistochemically	stained	for	nuclear	factor	erythroid	2-related	factor	2	(	Nrf2	)	,	Kelch	-	like	ECH	-	associated	protein	1	(	Keap1	)	,	thioredoxin	(	Trx	)	,	and	peroxiredoxin	I	(	response_to_oxidative_stress_I	)	.	.
s2334	In	conclusion	,	glycerol	phosphate	formation	for	de	novo	GPL	synthesis	via	glyceroneogenesis	is	a	newly	characterized	anabolic	pathway	in	cancer_cells	mediated	by	pyruvate_metabolic_process	-	M	under	conditions	of	severe	nutrient	deprivation	.
s3309	The	immunohistochemical	assay	using	clinical	samples	of	colonic	tumors	with	various	invasion	depth	showed	that	p	-	regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_expression	was	inversely	associated	with	tumor	invasion	(	p	=	0.001	,	hazard	ratio	(	HR	)	=	0.328	,	95	%	confidence	interval	(	95%CI	)	,	0.170	-	0.632	)	.	.
s3855	Intriguingly	,	five	CPGs	showed	concordance	between	CNL	and	down	-	regulation	in	50	or	more	tumor_samples	,	MTAP	(	216	samples	)	,	negative_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_(143	)	,	MCPH1	(	86	)	,	SMAD4	(	63	)	,	and	MINPP1	(	51	)	,	which	may	represent	the	recurrent	driving	force	for	gene	expression	change	during	oncogenesis	.	.
s244	Here	we	used	Sanger	sequencing	to	detect	mutations	in	exons	of	biological_process_in	340	unrelated	probands	with	spinocerebellar	ataxia	for	whom	commonly	known	causative	mutations	have	been	excluded	(	96	probands	of	autosomal	dominant	spinocerebellar	ataxia	families	and	244	patients	with	sporadic_spinocerebellar	ataxia	)	.	.
s3449	In	addition	,	the	analysis	of	upstream	miRNAs	showed	that	FOXF1	adjacent	non	-	coding	developmental	regulatory	RNA	(	FENDRR	)	had	common	upstream	miRNAs	,	including	miR-18b-5p	,	with	another	119	differentially	expressed	genes	,	and	that	FENDRR	was	co	-	expressed	with	adenomatosis	polyposis	coli	downregulated	1	(	negative_regulation_of_Wnt_signaling_pathway	)	and	v	-	kit	Hardy	-	Zuckerman	4	feline	sarcoma_viral	oncogene	homolog	(	KIT	)	.	.
s3789	Oral	and	pharyngeal	cancers	combined	were	associated	with	loci	at	6p21.32	(	rs3828805	,	HLA	-	DQB1	)	,	10q26.13	(	rs201982221	,	LHPP	)	and	11p15.4	(	rs1453414	,	G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway	-	TRIM5	)	.	.
s2271	In	this	study	,	we	investigated	the	function	of	HOXB1	and	the	relationship	between	HOXB1	and	protein_polyubiquitination-3175	in	glioma	.	.
s3091	Our	findings	expand	the	genetic	,	clinical	and	neuropathological	features	of	Brown	-	Vialetto	-	glycoprotein_biosynthetic_process_Laere	syndrome	,	implicate	mitochondrial_dysfunction_as	a	downstream	consequence	of	riboflavin	transporter	gene	defects	,	and	validate	riboflavin	esters	as	a	potential	therapeutic	strategy	.
s1951	Conditional	knockout	(	cKO	)	of	OL	-	potassium_ion_import_across_plasma_membrane_resulted	in	late	onset	mitochondrial	damage	and	axonal_degeneration	.	.
s1750	One	important	line	of	evidence	comes	from	genetic	studies	,	which	have	repeatedly	detected	an	association	between	the	neuronal	isoform	of	nitric	oxide	synthase	(	nNOS	or	posttranscriptional_regulation_of_gene_expression	)	and	schizophrenia	.	.
s436	Idiopathic	pulmonary	fibrosis	(	IPF	)	is	a	complex	,	heterogeneous_genetic	disorder	that	is	associated	with	rare	and	common	sequence	variants	in	many	genes	(	MUC5B	,	SFTPC	,	SFTPA2	,	telomere_maintenance	,	TERT	,	and	hTR	)	,	11	novel	loci	,	and	multiple	emerging	epigenetic	and	transcriptional	profiles	.	.
s598	Recent	prevalent	research	topic	concentrated	in	the	three	neighboring	genes	of	FTO	,	negative_regulation_of_G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway	,	IRX3	and	IRX5	,	as	having	a	functional	link	between	obesity	-	associated	common	variants	within	FTO	and	the	observed	human	phenotypes	.	.
s2729	However	,	certain	chromatin	remodeling	genes	(	MLL1	,	MLL2	,	MLL3	,	BAP1	,	PBRM1	,	EED	,	and	nucleosome_assembly	)	were	found	to	be	mutated	in	7/22	(	32	%	)	of	intraductal	tubulopapillary	neoplasms	and	27	%	harbored	phosphatidylinositol	3-kinase	(	PI3	K	)	pathway	(	PIK3CA	,	PIK3CB	,	INPP4A	,	and	PTEN	)	mutations	.	.
s614	On	the	other	hand	,	MYH1	,	MYH2	,	MYH3	,	MYH7	,	skeletal_muscle_contraction	,	FOXO3	,	NFATC1	,	PTGS2	,	KAT6B	,	HDAC4	,	and	RUNX2	expression	is	suspected	to	be	involved	in	the	epigenetic	regulations	behind	the	mandibular	prognathism_phenotype	.
s1992	DHEA	prevents	mitochondrial_dysfunction_by	decreasing	the	activation	of	DNM1L	and	protein_homooligomerization	,	and	increasing	MFN1	expression	.	.
s1584	The	ceRNA	network	indicated	that	lncRNA	MIR194	-	2HG	,	AATBC	and	circRNA	striated_muscle_tissue_development_could	harbor	bladder	cancer	-	related	microRNA	(	miRNA	)	recognition	elements	.	.
s1853	We	found	that	positive_regulation_of_canonical_Wnt_signaling_pathway_expression	in	the	epithelium	and	stroma	was	associated	with	tumor_stage	,	and	by	integrating	functional	experiments	with	LGR5-sorted	cell	RNA	sequencing	data	from	adenoma	and	normal	organoids	,	we	found	correlations	between	LGR5	and	CRC	-	specific	genes	,	including	dickkopf	WNT	signaling	pathway	inhibitor	4	(	DKK4	)	and	SPARC	-	related	modular	calcium	binding	2	(	SMOC2	)	.	.
s4057	In	the	present	study	,	the	results	obtained	from	our	previously	published	methylation	array	were	analyzed	and	10	candidate	genes	involved	in	DNA	repair	[	protein	phosphatase	4	catalytic	subunit	(	PPP4C	)	]	,	apoptosis	[	runt	related	transcription	factor	3	(	RUNX3	)	,	interferon	regulatory	factor	4	(	positive_regulation_of_interleukin-10_biosynthetic_process	)	,	ubiquitin	C	-	terminal	hydrolase	L1	(	UCHL1	)	and	tumor_protein	p53	inducible	protein	3	(	TP53I3	)	]	,	cell	proliferation	[	cyclin	D2	(	CCND2	)	and	Ras	association	domain	family	member	1	(	RASSF1	)	]	,	drug	metabolism	[	aldehyde	dehydrogenase	1	family	member	A3	(	ALDH1A3	)	and	solute	carrier	family	29	member	1	(	SLC29A1	)	]	and	angiogenesis	[	human	immunodeficiency	virus-1	tat	interactive	protein	2	(	HTATIP2	)	]	were	selected	for	quantification	of	their	methylation	levels	in	54	CCA	and	19	adjacent	normal	tissues	using	methylation	-	sensitive	high	-	resolution	melting	.	.
s563	Recent	GWAS	completed	for	three	types	of	common	adult	-	onset	glaucoma_have	identified	novel	loci	for	POAG	(	primary	-	open	-	angle	glaucoma	)	(	ABCA1	,	AFAP1	,	GMDS	,	PMM2	,	TGFBR3	,	FNDC3B	,	ARHGEF12	,	GAS7	,	FOXC1	,	ATXN2	,	TXNRD2	)	,	PACG	(	primary	angle	-	closure	glaucoma	(	EPDR1	,	CHAT	,	GLIS3	,	FERMT2	,	GPI_anchor_biosynthetic_process	-	FAM102	)	,	and	exfoliation	syndrome	(	XFS	)	glaucoma	(	CACNA1A	)	.	.
s1526	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	nucleobase	-	containing_compound_metabolic_process	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s2072	Five	of	the	fifteen	sarcosine_catabolic_process	-	deficient	GISTs	had	follow	-	up	data	,	one	patient	died	8	months	after	surgery	from	unknown	cause	,	four	had	no	recurrences	or	metastases	,	and	there	was	no	history	of	paraganglioma	and	pulmonary_chondroma_found	in	patients	and	their	families	.	.
s588	Gene	-	based	tests	highlighted	20	additional	genes	of	which	5	had	previously	been	associated	to	schizophrenia_and	/	or	bipolar	disorder	,	CSMD1	,	CCDC141	,	SLC1A2	,	CACNA1C	,	and	exocytosis	.	.
s195	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal	recessive	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy_(SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s611	On	the	other	hand	,	MYH1	,	muscle_contraction	,	MYH3	,	MYH7	,	MYH8	,	FOXO3	,	NFATC1	,	PTGS2	,	KAT6B	,	HDAC4	,	and	RUNX2	expression	is	suspected	to	be	involved	in	the	epigenetic	regulations	behind	the	mandibular	prognathism_phenotype	.
s2504	CHD	proteins	play	an	important	role	in	neurodevelopment	,	as	pathogenic	variants	in	CHD1	,	CHD2	,	CHD4	,	skeletal_system_development_and	CHD8	have	been	associated	with	a	range	of	neurological	phenotypes	,	including	autism	spectrum	disorder	(	ASD	)	,	intellectual	disability	(	ID	)	and	epilepsy	.	.
s1270	These	findings	link	cell_adhesion_deficiency	to	obesity_and	hypertension	.
s2920	Activation	of	GPER	and	its	downstream	signaling	MAPK	/	ERK	,	not	PI3K	/	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	,	led	to	enhanced	TRIM2	protein	levels	and	affected	the	binding	between	TRIM2	and	Bim	which	resulted	in	a	reduced	Bim	in	TAM	-	resistant	breast	cancer_cells	.	.
s610	On	the	other	hand	,	muscle_contraction	,	MYH2	,	MYH3	,	MYH7	,	MYH8	,	FOXO3	,	NFATC1	,	PTGS2	,	KAT6B	,	HDAC4	,	and	RUNX2	expression	is	suspected	to	be	involved	in	the	epigenetic	regulations	behind	the	mandibular	prognathism_phenotype	.
s983	RT	-	PCR	analysis	showed	that	the	overall	transcriptional	activity	of	the	main	HS	biosynthesis	-	involved	genes	(	EXT1	,	EXT2	,	NDST1	,	NDST2	,	heparan_sulfate_proteoglycan_biosynthetic_process	,	HS2ST1	,	HS3ST1	,	HS3ST2	,	HS6ST1	,	HS6ST2	,	SULF1	,	SULF2	,	HPSE	)	was	decreased	by	1.5	-	2-fold	in	Grade	II	-	III	glioma_(p	AAAA	0.01	)	and	by	3-fold	in	Grade	IV	glioma	(	glioblastoma	multiforme	,	GBM	)	(	p	AAAA	0.05	)	,	as	compared	with	the	para	-	tumourous	tissue	.	.
s2723	All	intraductal	tubulopapillary	neoplasms	revealed	the	characteristic	histologic	(	cellular	intraductal	nodules	of	back	-	to	-	back	tubular	glands	lined	by	predominantly	cuboidal	cells	with	atypical	nuclei	and	no	obvious	intracellular	mucin	)	and	immunohistochemical	(	immunolabeled	with	MUC1	and	stimulatory_C	-	type_lectin_receptor_signaling_pathway_but	were	negative	for	MUC2	and	MUC5AC	)	features	.	.
s2318	RESULTS	There	was	an	increased	expression	of	dolichol	-	linked_oligosaccharide_biosynthetic_process_in	breast	cancer_tissues	compared	to	normal	breast	tissues	(	pAAAA0.05	)	.	.
s981	RT	-	PCR	analysis	showed	that	the	overall	transcriptional	activity	of	the	main	HS	biosynthesis	-	involved	genes	(	glycosaminoglycan_biosynthetic_process	,	EXT2	,	NDST1	,	NDST2	,	GLCE	,	HS2ST1	,	HS3ST1	,	HS3ST2	,	HS6ST1	,	HS6ST2	,	SULF1	,	SULF2	,	HPSE	)	was	decreased	by	1.5	-	2-fold	in	Grade	II	-	III	glioma_(p	AAAA	0.01	)	and	by	3-fold	in	Grade	IV	glioma	(	glioblastoma	multiforme	,	GBM	)	(	p	AAAA	0.05	)	,	as	compared	with	the	para	-	tumourous	tissue	.	.
s1943	However	,	in	HaCaT	and	HEK293	T	cells	that	display	transformed	phenotypes	,	but	do	not	originate	from	patient	-	derived	tumors	,	the	ER	stress	-	inducing	treatments	resulted	in	an	upregulation	of	FAM129A	and	HKDC1	,	but	not	aging_transcripts	,	By	a	luciferase	reporter	approach	we	identified	a	highly	active	ATF4-responsive	element	within	the	upstream	region	of	the	KRT16	gene	.	.
s940	For	further	investigation	,	a	cross	-	sectional	study	was	performed	to	evaluate	the	association	of	cognitive	impairment	,	by	using	frontal	assessment	battery	,	and	memory_loss	,	using	memory	failures	everyday	,	with	the	circulating	levels	of	the	neurotrophin	brain	-	derived	neurotrophic	factor	(	synapse_assembly	)	and	neurotrophin	3	(	NT-3	)	in	abstinent	subjects	with	alcohol	use	disorders	(	AUDs	,	N	=	58	,	average	of	17.9	years	of	problematic	use	and	4.3	months	of	abstinence	)	compared	with	healthy	control	subjects	(	N	=	22	)	.	.
s1344	RESULTS	The	expression	of	response_to_calcium_ion_in	cancer_tissues	was	higher	than	in	adjacent	mucosa	at	mRNA	and	protein	levels	.	.
s2721	The	more	common	member	of	this	family	,	intraductal	papillary	mucinous	neoplasm	,	often	carries	genetic	alterations	typical	of	pancreatic	infiltrating	ductal	adenocarcinoma	(	KRAS	,	TP53	,	and	G1/S_transition_of_mitotic_cell_cycle	)	but	additionally	has	mutations	in	GNAS	and	RNF43	genes	.	.
s3054	Inactivation	of	hair_follicle_development	/	Alx4	causes	lacrimal_gland_aplasia_in	both	human	and	mouse	.	.
s327	Here	,	we	have	performed	a	prospective	nationwide	genetic	association	study	using	the	Human	Exome	BeadChip	and	identified	gene	variants	in	encoding	dynactin	4	(	nuclear_migration	)	,	retinoic	acid	early	transcript	1E	(	RAET1E	)	,	and	V	-	akt	murine	thymoma	viral	oncogene	homolog	3	(	AKT3	)	to	be	associated	with	unfavourable	outcome	in	patients	with	pneumococcal	meningitis	.	.
s460	After	downregulating	regulation_of_synaptic_transmission,_glycinergic_or	blocking	PARP-1	artificially	,	the	sensitive	thyroid	cancer_cells	mostly	displayed	a	tolerant	phenotype	under	131I	exposure	.	.
s1414	Collectively	,	we	nominate	regulation_of_autophagy_as	a	novel	deubiquitinase	which	regulates	MCL1	turnover	in	diverse	solid	tumors	and	propose	that	USP13	may	be	a	potential	therapeutic	target	for	the	treatment	of	various	malignancies	.
s2990	However	,	the	role	of	positive_regulation_of_cytokine	-	mediated_signaling_pathway_in	thyroid	cancer_has	never	been	revealed	.	.
s1630	This	review	reflects	the	existing	positive_regulation_of_cell	-	matrix_adhesion	/	ephrin	literature	while	focusing	on	breast	cancer	heterogeneity	.	.
s3691	We	previously	conducted	transcriptome	analysis	of	a	paired	specimen	of	normal	and	esophageal	squamous_cell_carcinoma_(ESCC	)	tissues	and	found	that	mRNA	expression	of	cystatin	A	(	negative_regulation_of_peptidase_activity	)	,	a	member	of	the	cystatin	superfamily	,	was	perturbed	in	tumors	compared	with	that	in	the	background	mucosa	.	.
s86	In	Mfrprd6	eyes	,	a	significant	1.5-	to	2.0-fold	decrease	was	observed	among	transcripts	of	genes	linked	to	retinal_degeneration	,	including	those	involved	in	visual	cycle	(	Rpe65	,	Lrat	,	Rgr	)	,	phototransduction	(	Pde6a	,	Guca1b	,	Rgs9	)	,	and	photoreceptor	disc	morphogenesis	(	Rrelationip1_and_actin_cytoskeleton_organization	)	.	.
s3131	Mutations	in	MYH3	and	skeletal_muscle_contraction_are	associated	with	distal_arthrogryposis	syndromes	.	.
s1155	Our	recent	determination	of	a	microRNA	(	protein_polyubiquitinationNA	)	expression	signature	in	prostate	cancer_(PCa	)	revealed	that	miR-205	-	5p	was	significantly	reduced	in	PCa	tissues	and	that	it	acted	as	an	antitumor	miRNA	.	.
s1132	Therefore	,	the	heterophilic_cell	-	cell_adhesion_via_plasma_membrane_cell_adhesion_molecules_gene	is	a	key	target	in	the	fight	against	blindness	.	.
s720	Spinocerebellar	ataxia_type	8	(	SCA8	)	is	a	progressive	neurological	disorder	caused	by	the	expanded	repeat	CTA	/	CTG	of	two	overlapping	genes	,	biological_processOS	and	ATXN8	,	expressed	bidirectionally	.	.
s831	Therefore	,	proline_biosynthetic_process_might	serve	as	a	prognostic	biomaker	for	either	ER	-	positive	or	ER	-	negative	breast	cancer_subtypes	and	can	also	be	a	potential	target	for	breast	cancer	therapy	.
s440	The	aim	of	the	study	was	detailed	clinicopathological	investigation	of	nucleosome_disassembly	/	INI1-deficient	sinonasal	carcinomas	,	including	molecular	genetic	analysis	of	mutational	status	and	DNA	methylation	of	selected	protooncogenes	and	tumor_suppressor	genes	by	means	of	next	generation	sequencing	(	NGS	)	and	methylation	-	specific	multiplex	ligation	-	dependent	probe	amplification	(	MS	-	MLPA	)	.	.
s3296	In	conclusion	,	our	data	suggested	an	essential	role	of	negative_regulation_of_kinase_activity_in	the	tumorgenesis	of	breast	cancer	.	.
s1657	Immunostaining	showed	that	the	colon	cancer_was	positive	for	CDX2	,	SATB2	,	had	a	loss	of	PMS2	and	intact	expression	of	mismatch_repair	,	MSH2	and	MSH6	,	negative	for	AMACR	,	while	the	prostate	cancer	was	positive	for	AMACR	,	had	intact	expression	of	PMS2	,	MLH1	,	MSH2	and	MSH6	,	and	negative	for	CDX2	and	SATB2	.	.
s237	Here	we	describe	four	additional	individuals	from	three	families	,	comprising	two	sporadic_subjects	(	one	of	whom	had	no	limb	malformation	)	and	a	mildly	affected	female	with	a	severely	affected	mRNA_processing	.	.
s3565	Most	of	the	genes	that	are	commonly	associated	with	colon	cancer	,	including	cellular_response_to_DNA_damage_stimulus	,	TP53	,	and	KRAS	,	were	all	classified	as	being	early	driver	genes	being	mutated	in	both	adenomas	and	carcinomas	.	.
s2022	In	the	present	study	,	we	silenced	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_expression	in	pancreatic	cancer_cell	lines	and	identified	the	positive	roles	of	CBX3	in	cancer	cell	proliferation	.	.
s417	photoreceptor_cell_maintenance_has	been	shown	to	be	an	important	stem	cell	factor	that	promotes	glioma_progression	.	.
s3481	We	have	previously	identified	a	role	for	the	secreted	serine	protease	camera	-	type_eye_development_in	ocular	size	determination	and	PRSS56	variants	have	been	implicated	in	the	etiology	of	both	hyperopia_and	myopia	,	highlighting	its	importance	in	refractive	development	.	.
s912	Immunoperoxidase	levels	in	the	tumor_were	positive	for	factor	VIII	and	CD31	and	negative	for	S100	,	protein	Melan	-	A	,	CD34	,	synaptophysin	,	chromogranin	,	desmin	,	muscle	specific	actin	,	ETFA	(	EMA	)	,	KRT20	(	CK20	)	,	CDX2	,	TTF1	,	negative_regulation_of_cold	-	induced_thermogenesis_(PLAP	)	,	inhibin	,	?	-fetoprotein	,	CD30	,	hepatocyte	paraffin	,	and	aberrant	expression	of	cytokeratin	7	and	pankeratin	.	.
s3413	Moreover	,	immunohistochemistry	demonstrates	that	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation_is	highly	expressed	in	80	%	of	H	-	ChC	,	implying	the	stemness	of	such	liver	cancer	.	.
s3300	We	present	a	case	of	myoclonus	-	dystonia	syndrome	illustrated	by	three	videos	in	which	we	found	a	novel	skeletal_muscle_tissue_development_mutation	.	.
s1260	The	expression	of	uncarboxylated	cartilage_condensation_(ucMGP	)	,	carboxylated	MGP	(	cMGP	)	,	matrix	metalloproteinase	(	MMP)-13	,	collagen	type	X	,	collagen	type	II	,	tumor_necrosis	factor	(	TNF)-a	and	interleukin	(	IL)-1b	were	detected	by	ELISA	,	immunohistochemistry	,	reverse	transcription	-	quantitative	polymerase	chain	reaction	and	western	blotting	.	.
s3	This	region	contained	the	negative_regulation_of_phosphatase_activity_gene	,	and	the	orthologous	mouse	gene	was	described	to	be	mutated	in	the	pirouette	(	pi	)	mutant	with	resulting	hearing_loss_and	circling	behavior	.	.
s3850	These	include	an	enhancer	in	an	ataxia_telangiectasia	mutated	(	protein_phosphorylation	)	intron	that	has	SNPs	in	linkage	disequilibrium	with	a	metformin	treatment	response	GWAS	lead	SNP	(	rs11212617	)	that	showed	increased	enhancer	activity	for	the	associated	haplotype	.	.
s1425	Higher	expression	of	EEF1A2	,	EEF1B2	,	EEF1	G	,	EEF1D	,	EEF1E1	and	positive_regulation_of_translation_was	observed	in	most	of	the	cancer_types	,	whereas	reverse	trend	was	observed	for	EEF1A1	.	.
s959	In	conclusion	,	our	results	reveal	a	role	for	the	cellular_response_to_drug_potassium	channel	in	the	regulation	of	human	growth	,	and	show	that	growth	hormone	deficiency	associated	with	maternally	inherited	gingival	fibromatosis	is	an	allelic	disorder	with	cardiac_arrhythmia_syndromes	caused	by	KCNQ1	mutations	.
s2237	These	results	suggest	that	MAFB	and	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_play	critical	roles	in	the	antitumor_effects	of	retinoids	by	regulating	the	expression	of	retinoid	target	genes	such	as	TFPI2	and	can	be	promising	for	developing	therapies	to	combat	HCC	invasion	.
s924	Highlights	include	the	discoveries	of	(	i	)	a	new	genetic	etiology	,	autosomal_recessive_SPPL2a	deficiency	,	(	ii	)	protein_phosphorylation	-	deficient	patients	with	a	clinical	phenotype	of	MSMD	,	(	iii	)	an	allelic	form	of	partial	recessive	IFN	-	yR2	deficiency	,	and	(	iv	)	two	forms	of	syndromic	MSMD	,	RORy	/	RORyT	and	JAK1	deficiencies	.	.
s3999	Five	genes	,	including	OTOGL	,	PLCB4	,	SCEL	,	THSD4	,	and	WWOX	,	have	CNVs	in	the	six	patients	with	sporadic_HBs	,	and	three	genes	,	including	lipid_transport	,	CWC27	,	and	LAMA2	,	have	CNVs	in	the	five	patients	with	familial	HBs	.	.
s911	Immunoperoxidase	levels	in	the	tumor_were	positive	for	factor	VIII	and	CD31	and	negative	for	S100	,	protein	Melan	-	A	,	CD34	,	synaptophysin	,	chromogranin	,	desmin	,	muscle	specific	actin	,	ETFA	(	EMA	)	,	KRT20	(	CK20	)	,	CDX2	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	LNPEP	(	PLAP	)	,	inhibin	,	?	-fetoprotein	,	CD30	,	hepatocyte	paraffin	,	and	aberrant	expression	of	cytokeratin	7	and	pankeratin	.	.
s3454	In	the	present	study	the	expression	status	of	peptidyl	-	threonine_phosphorylation_and	its	prognostic	significance	in	gastric	cancer_was	determined	,	as	well	as	its	role	in	cell	proliferation	and	invasion	.	.
s267	Among	them	four	novel	fusion	genes	protein_heterooligomerization	/	CYHR	,	IGF1R	/	TTC23	,	SYT8/TNNI2	and	CASZ1/DFFA	were	validated	and	characterized	in	48	formalin	-	fixed	paraffin	-	embedded	(	FFPE	)	specimens	of	bladder	cancer	.	.
s334	A	patient	myoblast	line	showed	a	severe_reduction	in	complex	I	,	associated	with	the	accumulation	of	subassemblies	centered	around	a340	kDa	,	and	a	milder	decrease	in	complex	II	,	all	of	which	were	rescued	by	retroviral	expression	of	wild	-	type	mitochondrial_respiratory_chain_complex_I_assembly	.	.
s620	Mutations	in	three	subunits	(	DRC1	,	DRC2/regulation_of_cilium_movement	,	DRC4/GAS8	)	have	been	linked	to	defects	in	ciliary	motility	in	humans	and	lead	to	a	ciliopathy	known	as	primary	ciliary_dyskinesia_(PCD	)	.	.
s3030	Previously	,	we	reported	that	human	hepatoma	cells	that	harbor	OXPHOS	defects	exhibit	high	tumor_cell	invasiveness	via	elevated	claudin-1	(	protein_depalmitoylation	)	.	.
s3334	double	-	strand_break_repair_is	one	of	the	essential	proteins	of	this	pathway	and	single	-	nucleotide	polymorphisms	(	SNPs	)	of	this	gene	are	reported	to	be	associated	with	cancer_risks	.	.
s1998	The	G2019S	mutation	in	Leucine	-	Rich	Repeat	Kinase	2	(	MAPK_cascade	)	is	a	prevalent	cause	of	late	-	onset	Parkinson	s	Disease	,	producing	psychiatric	and	motor	symptoms	,	including	depression	,	that	are	indistinguishable	from	sporadic_cases	.	.
s2112	Here	we	established	a	mutation	detection	system	based	on	multiple	fluorescent	probe	technique	,	which	can	detect	and	genotype	nine	hotspot	mutations	of	four	prominent	hearing_loss	-	related	genes	in	two	reactions	on	a	four	-	channel	real	-	time	PCR	instrument	,	including	gap_junction_assembly_(rs750188782	,	rs80338943	,	rs1110333204	,	and	rs80338939	)	,	GJB3	(	rs74315319	)	,	SLC26A4	(	rs111033313	and	rs121908362	)	,	and	mtDNA	12S	rRNA	(	rs267606617	and	rs267606619	)	.	.
s3952	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_overexpression	greatly	enhanced	HCC	cell	capability	for	tumorsphere	formation	,	invasion	and	chemoresistance	in	vitro	,	whereas	inhibiting	ZNF687	reduced	these	capabilities	and	inhibited	HCC	cell	tumorigenic	capability	in	vivo	.	.
s768	We	present	confirmatory	evidence	for	a	role	of	dystonia_genes	that	had	not	yet	been	unequivocally	established	including	production_of_siRNA_involved_in_RNA_interference	,	TUBB4A	,	ANO3	,	and	TAF1	.	.
s3319	protein_polyubiquitination-223	is	implicated	in	both	vascular_calcification_and	osteoporosis	.	.
s1277	There	were	no	significant	differences	in	tumor_characteristics	,	including	size	at	pathologic	examination	,	grade	,	hormone	receptor	status	,	and	positive_regulation_of_cysteine	-	type_endopeptidase_activity_involved_in_apoptotic_process_status	,	between	the	screening	-	detected	invasive	cancers	on	DM	versus	DBT	(	P	=	.09-.99	)	.	.
s2879	The	results	revealed	that	the	most	biological_process	-	specific	proteins	were	associated	with	events	involved	in	tumor_development	,	while	chemotherapy	in	the	PS	group	was	associated	with	side	effects	of	drugs	and/or	cancer	recurrence	.	.
s3625	PFKFB4	and	phosphorylated	peptidyl	-	tyrosine_phosphorylation-3	levels	are	increased	and	correlate	in	oestrogen	receptor	-	positive	tumours	,	whereas	,	in	patients	with	the	basal	subtype	,	PFKFB4	and	SRC-3	drive	a	common	protein	signature	that	correlates	with	the	poor	survival	of	patients	with	breast	cancer	.	.
s1101	Disruption	of	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	encoding	a	component	of	the	Mediator	complex	,	is	increasingly	recognized	as	the	cause	of	an	intellectual	disability	syndrome	with	associated	facial_dysmorphism	.	.
s1305	Furthermore	,	the	inhibition	of	mitochondrial_pyruvate_transmembrane_transport_expression	induced	EMT	in	cancer	cells	,	and	the	overexpression	of	MPC1	suppressed	the	migration	of	tumor_cells	.	.
s1013	Over	the	last	5	years	,	several	single	gene	disorders	of	the	autophagy	pathway	have	emerged	,	autophagy	-	associated	Vici	syndrome	,	WDR45-associated	b	-	propeller	protein	-	associated	neurodegeneration	,	SNX14-associated	autosomal	-	recessive	spinocerebellar	ataxia_20	,	ATG5-associated	autosomal	-	recessive	ataxia	syndrome	,	SQSTM1/p62-associated	childhood	-	onset	neurodegeneration	,	and	several	forms	of	the	hereditary	spastic	paraplegias	.	.
s253	tRNA_wobble_adenosine_to_inosine_editing	-	related	intellectual_disability_is	an	important	recognizable	cause	of	intellectual	disability	in	Arabia	.
s193	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal	recessive	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/protein_targeting_to_mitochondrion	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy_(SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s121	A	third	proband	was	doubly	heterozygous	for	inherited	rare	variants	in	additional	components	of	complex	I	,	NDUFAF2	and	mitochondrial_respiratory_chain_complex_I_assembly	,	confirming	that	Histiocytoid	CM	is	genetically	heterogeneous	.	.
s3095	Previous	studies	have	identified	a	critical	role	for	the	tumor_suppressors	BRCA1	and	BRCA2	in	preventing	the	degradation	of	nascent	DNA	by	the	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination_nuclease	after	replication	stress	.	.
s2231	In	the	present	study	,	we	sought	to	identify	the	factors	involved	in	the	RARAAAAAalpha	,-	mediated	transcriptional	regulation	of	the	tumor	suppressor	gene	and	the	tissue	factor	pathway	inhibitor	2	(	blood_coagulation	)	in	hepatocellular_carcinoma_(HCC	)	.	.
s3015	These	3	patients	shared	congenital	neutropenia_linked	with	various	other	mitotic_spindle_organization_phenotypes	.	.
s3979	Here	,	we	report	that	pyruvate_metabolic_process	-	M	-	dependent	glycerol	phosphate	formation	from	noncarbohydrate	precursors	(	glyceroneogenesis	)	occurs	in	starved	lung	cancer_cells	and	supports	de	novo	glycerophospholipid	synthesis	.	.
s1391	Taken	together	,	the	results	indicate	that	increase	of	defense_response_to_virus_content	and	up	-	regulation	of	perlecan	/	HSPG2	expression	in	glioblastoma_tissues	contribute	to	tumour	development	through	the	transformation	of	brain	extracellular	matrix	into	tumour	microenvironment	,	and	represent	negative	prognostic	factors	for	glioblastoma	progression	.
s2909	The	present	study	also	identified	in	tumor_and	potentially	malignant	lesions	common	alterations	of	chromosomal	regions	and	genes	,	including	FBXL5	,	UGT2B15	,	UGT2B28	,	KANSL1	,	GSTT1	and	peptidyl	-	tyrosine_dephosphorylation	,	being	some	of	these	typical	aberrations	described	in	oral	cancer	and	others	are	linked	to	chemoradioresistance	.	.
s2419	In	cancer_patients	,	elevated	levels	of	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_are	associated	with	greater	degrees	of	muscle	wasting	.	.
s400	3-Methylglutaconic	aciduria	is	associated	with	variants	in	genes	encoding	mitochondrial_inner	membrane	organizing	determinants	,	including	TAZ	,	DNAJC19	,	intracellular_cholesterol_transport_and	QIL1/MIC13	.
s738	Our	objective	was	to	identify	the	CpG	loci	that	are	persistently	hyper	-	methylated	during	serrated	carcinogenesis	,	from	the	early	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	/	P	lesion	through	the	later	cancer	phases	of	neoplasia_development	.	.
s3367	Lamb	-	Shaffer	syndrome	(	OMIM	,	616803	)	is	a	neurodevelopmental	disorder	characterized	by	developmental	delay	,	mild	to	moderate	intellectual_disability	,	speech	delay	,	and	mild	characteristic	facial	appearance	caused	by	positive_regulation_of_chondrocyte_differentiation_haploinsufficiency	on	chromosome	12p12.1	.	.
s191	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal_recessive_Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy	(	SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	SPG46/GBA2	,	SPG55/translational_termination_and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s3606	Recently	,	pan	-	protein_phosphorylation_inhibitors	have	been	evaluated	and	their	dramatic	clinical	activity	is	being	shown	for	a	variety	of	cancer_types	harboring	an	NTRK	rearrangement	in	phase	I	trials	.	.
s2638	Galloway	-	Mowat	syndrome	(	GMS	)	is	an	inherited	disorder	characterized	by	microcephaly_and	nephrosis	resulting	from	mutations	in	the	nucleus_organization_gene	.	.
s3718	Further	haplotype	and	imputation	analyses	also	validated	these	results	,	and	bioinformatics	analyses	indicated	that	CALHM1	,	which	is	located	approximately	630	kb	away	from	magnesium_ion_homeostasis	,	might	be	a	susceptible	gene	for	schizophrenia	.	.
s3255	Here	we	show	that	mitochondrial	Sirtuin5	(	protein_deacetylation	)	,	which	mediates	lysine	desuccinylation	,	deglutarylation	,	and	demalonylation	,	plays	a	role	in	colorectal	cancer_(CRC	)	glutamine	metabolic	rewiring	.	.
s1866	Several	independent	research	groups	,	including	our	own	,	recently	examined	the	effects	of	heterozygous	deletion	of	chromatin	-	mediated_maintenance_of_transcription_in	mice	and	reported	severe	behavioral	abnormalities	reminiscent	of	autism	spectrum	disorders	and	intellectual_disability_as	well	as	marked	changes	in	gene	expression	and	decreased	body	size	.	.
s2180	A	17-year	-	old	adolescent	boy	with	a	history	of	hypoproteinemia_underwent	regulation_of_apoptotic_process	-	NEB	PET	/	MRI	to	evaluate	possible	lymphatic	disorders	suggested	by	FDG	PET	/	CT	imaging	.	.
s332	We	identified	a	homozygous	missense	mutation	,	c.1308	G	-	A	(	p	.	V421	M	)	in	mitochondrial_respiratory_chain_complex_I_assembly_in	a	patient	who	presented	with	epilepsy_and	severe	psychomotor	retardation	.	.
s2516	Extensive	search	of	the	literature	revealed	a	potential	key	role	of	genes	at	the	identified	porcine	loci	in	tumor_invasion	(	DST	,	PLEKHA5	,	CBY1	,	actin_cytoskeleton_organization_and	ETV5	)	and	immune	response	modulation	(	ETV5	,	HERC3	and	DICER1	)	of	the	progression	phenotypes	.	.
s3489	One	of	these	two	is	a	novel	AMD	GWAS	locus	,	near	the	retinal	clusterin	-	like	protein	(	biological_process	)	gene	,	and	the	other	,	near	the	retinaldehyde	binding	protein	1	(	RLBP1	)	,	was	recently	identified	in	a	joint	analysis	of	nuclear	and	mitochondrial_variants	.	.
s2704	The	chromosome	22	disorder	,	due	to	mutations	in	the	nuclear	gene	pyrimidine_nucleoside_metabolic_process_encoding	thymidine	phosphorylase	(	TP	)	,	leads	to	the	accumulation	of	thymidine	and	deoxyuridine	,	with	mitochondrial	dysfunction	.	This	report	describes	a	patient	with	an	MNGIE	-	like	syndrome	with	a	heterozygous	TYMP	mutation	who	showed	marked	,	but	transient	improvement	postallogeneic	haematopoietic	stem	cell	transplantation	(	HSCT).The	patient	,	showing	ptosis	and	ophthalmoplegia	,	was	initially	managed	for	myasthenia	gravis	.	.

s3988	Conclusion	,	Cases	with	nuclear	-	transcribed_mRNA_catabolic_process_gene	defects	often	manifests	as	short_stature	,	optic	nerve	atrophy	,	Pelger	-	Huet	anomaly	,	skeletal	dysplasia	,	recurrent	infections	,	abnormality	of	liver	enzymes	,	progeroid	appearance	,	proptosis	,	hypotonia	and	immunodeficiency	.	.
s1664	The	action	of	the	collagen	binding	receptor	tyrosine	kinase	(	RTK	)	discoidin	domain	receptor	2	(	peptidyl	-	tyrosine_phosphorylation	)	in	both	tumor	and	tumor	stromal	cells	has	been	established	as	critical	for	breast	cancer_metastasis	.	.
s552	Recent	GWAS	completed	for	three	types	of	common	adult	-	onset	glaucoma_have	identified	novel	loci	for	POAG	(	primary	-	open	-	angle	glaucoma	)	(	ABCA1	,	AFAP1	,	GMDS	,	mannose_metabolic_process	,	TGFBR3	,	FNDC3B	,	ARHGEF12	,	GAS7	,	FOXC1	,	ATXN2	,	TXNRD2	)	,	PACG	(	primary	angle	-	closure	glaucoma	(	EPDR1	,	CHAT	,	GLIS3	,	FERMT2	,	DPM2-FAM102	)	,	and	exfoliation	syndrome	(	XFS	)	glaucoma	(	CACNA1A	)	.	.
s257	Here	we	show	that	the	microphthalmia	-	associated	transcription	factor	,	MITF	,	which	plays	a	central	role	in	the	development	and	function	of	carbohydrate_metabolic_process_cells	,	regulates	the	expression	of	two	visual	cycle	genes	,	Rlbp1	which	encodes	retinaldehyde	binding	protein-1	(	RLBP1	)	,	and	Rdh5	,	which	encodes	retinol	dehydrogenase-5	(	RDH5	)	.	.
s3635	BACKGROUND	B_cell_cytokine_production	-	related	immunological	activities	are	found	in	normal	-	pressure	glaucoma_(NPG	)	patients	,	in	whom	an	elevated	intraocular	pressure	(	IOP	)	found	in	primary	open	-	angle	glaucoma	(	POAG	)	is	not	observed	.	.
s1982	We	aimed	to	define	the	role	of	myeloid	histone_methylation_in	alcohol	-	associated	liver	tumor_progressionusing	a	mouse	model	of	DEN	injection	followed	by	Lieber	-	DeCarli	alcohol	liquid	diet	feeding	.	.
s937	Due	to	the	heterogeneity_of	the	studies	assessed	,	no	endothelial_cell_morphogenesisa	-	analysis	could	be	performed	.	.
s3881	We	performed	whole	-	exome	sequencing	on	a	12-year	-	old	Japanese	male	with	severe	intellectual	disability	,	congenital	bilateral_cataracts	,	spasticity	,	hypotonia	with	motor	regression	and	progressive	cerebellar	atrophy	with	hyperintensity	of	the	cerebellar	cortex	on	positive_regulation_of_cell_proliferation	-	weighted	images	.	.
s1422	Higher	expression	of	EEF1A2	,	EEF1B2	,	response_to_virus	,	EEF1D	,	EEF1E1	and	EEF2	was	observed	in	most	of	the	cancer_types	,	whereas	reverse	trend	was	observed	for	EEF1A1	.	.
s3694	It	was	reduced	in	all	ESCC	tissue	samples	compared	with	normal	tissues	,	however	,	negative_regulation_of_peptidase_activity_expression	levels	in	tumors	showed	considerable	variation	.	.
s1360	Among	these	genes	,	mutations	in	double	-	strand_break_repair_gene	involve	in	inclusion	body	myopathy	with	Paget	disease	of	bone	and	frontotemporal	dementia	(	IBMPFD	)	,	familial	amyotrophic	lateral	sclerosis	(	ALS	)	,	autism_spectrum	disorders	(	ASD	)	,	and	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	(	HSP	)	.	.
s2685	Five	genes	,	including	OTOGL	,	G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway	,	SCEL	,	THSD4	,	and	WWOX	,	have	CNVs	in	the	six	patients	with	sporadic_HBs	,	and	three	genes	,	including	ABCA6	,	CWC27	,	and	LAMA2	,	have	CNVs	in	the	five	patients	with	familial	HBs	.	.
s2331	Serine	and	ribose	synthesis	have	been	identified	as	downstream	pathways	fed	by	pyruvate_metabolic_process_in	cancer_cells	.	.
s3104	We	also	analyzed	specific	mutations	within	the	12	genes	and	found	that	some	specific	mutations	within	the	stimulatory_C	-	type_lectin_receptor_signaling_pathway	,	FOXD4L3	and	FOXD4L5	genes	showed	higher	frequencies	in	the	samples	of	FLC	and/or	lung	cancer_tissue	,	compared	with	the	healthy	population	.	.
s3591	Lynch	syndrome	,	a	hereditary	cancer_syndrome	,	occurs	because	of	germline	mutations	in	at	least	one	of	four	DNA	mismatch	repair	genes	(	MutL	Homolog	1	(	MLH1	)	,	MutS	Homolog	2	(	DNA_repair	)	,	MutS	Homolog	6	(	MSH6	)	,	and	PMS1	Homolog	2	(	PMS2	)	)	.	.
s1008	These	findings	indicate	that	the	protein_polyubiquitination-587/PPP2R1B	/	pAKT	/	XIAP	signaling	axis	has	an	important	role	in	mediating	response	to	chemotherapy	in	colorectal	cancer	.	.
s1482	Missense	mutations	that	disrupt	the	RING	domain	of	the	tumor	suppressor	gene	double	-	strand_break_repair_via_homologous_recombination_lead	to	increased	risk	of	breast	and	ovarian	cancer	.	.
s2661	Zinc	finger	protein	687	(	regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	)	,	identified	as	a	C2H2	zinc	finger	protein	,	has	been	found	to	be	mutated	and	upregulated	in	giant	cell	tumor_of	bone	and	acute	myeloid	leukemia	,	suggesting	an	oncogenic	role	for	ZNF687	in	cancer	.	.
s3395	Mounting	evidence	has	shown	that	protein_polyubiquitination-23b-3p	,	which	is	associated	with	cell	proliferation	,	invasion	,	and	apoptosis	,	acts	as	a	biomarker	for	diagnosis	and	outcomes	in	numerous	cancers	.	.
s1973	We	evaluated	the	presence	of	cell	-	matrix_adhesion_in	cyst	fluid	and	tissue	from	glioblastomas	or	brain	metastases	.	The	amount	of	L1CAM	in	cyst	fluid	of	9	glioblastomas	and	11	brain	metastases	was	assessed	using	enzyme	-	linked	immunosorbent	assay	(	ELISA	)	.	.
s676	Alterations	of	von	Hippel	-	Lindau	(	protein_ubiquitination	)	,	succinate	dehydrogenase	(	SDHX	)	,	and	TMEM127	have	been	associated	with	the	development	of	pheochromocytomas	(	PCs	)	and	paragangliomas_(PGLs	)	and	are	also	associated	with	the	development	of	renal	neoplasms	.	.
s475	Mutations	in	the	Pejvakin	(	sensory_perception_of_sound	)	gene	cause	autosomal_recessive_hearing	loss	DFNB59	with	audiological	features	of	auditory	neuropathy	spectrum	disorder	(	ANSD	)	or	cochlear	dysfunction	.	.
s278	In	the	present	study	,	we	demonstrated	that	positive_regulation_of_angiogenesis_was	overexpressed	in	neuroblastoma	tissues	and	was	correlated	with	tumor_malignance	and	prognosis	.	.
s728	Recently	mutations	in	the	CASPR	/	cell_adhesion_complex	have	been	associated	with	similar	severe	phenotypes	and	CNTNAP1	gene	mutations	,	causing	loss	of	the	CASPR	protein	,	were	shown	to	cause	severe	,	prenatal	onset	arthrogryposis_multiplex	congenita	in	four	unrelated	families	.	.
s1700	RNA	interference	was	used	to	inhibit	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_in	human	HUH6	hepatoblastoma_cells	,	and	changes	in	cell	migration	were	measured	with	wound	healing	and	transwell	assays	.	.
s2450	We	demonstrate	the	effectiveness	of	morphometric	techniques	in	measuring	changes	in	the	relative	size	of	neuroanatomical	subdivisions	in	neural_retina_development_morphant	larvae	and	in	identifying	phenotypes	in	larvae	treated	with	valproic	acid	,	a	chemical	demonstrated	to	increase	the	risk	of	autism_in	humans	.	.
s3935	To	gain	insight	into	the	molecular	basis	of	the	heterogeneous_phenotype	observed	in	men	with	the	deletion	we	defined	the	type	of	DAZ	and	spermatogenesis_genes	deleted	.	.
s3202	However	,	more	recently	,	inherited	SWI	/	SNF	-	deficiency	has	been	linked	to	several	benign	syndromic	tumors	including	a	subset	of	familial	schwannomatosis	(	linked	to	nucleosome_disassembly	)	and	multiple	meningiomas	(	linked	to	SMARCE1	)	as	well	as	others	.	.
s2944	Hence	,	we	focus	on	the	relationship	between	regulation_of_cell_cycle	/	TAZ	and	serine	metabolism	to	control	methylation	of	DNA	or	histone	in	breast	cancer_with	LKB1	deficiency	.	.
s265	Clinical	lung	cancer_tissue	and	normal	tissue	were	collected	,	and	the	mRNA	expression	of	biological_process_in	cancer	tissue	was	significantly	higher	than	that	in	normal	tissue	.	.
s1377	The	contiguous	deletion	of	NDP	and	its	neighbouring	genes	,	MAOA	/	B	and	cellular_response_to_leukemia_inhibitory_factor	,	reportedly	leads	to	syndromic	clinical	features	such	as	microcephaly	,	intellectual	disability	,	and	epilepsy	.	.
s1682	In	all	,	13	tumours	were	analysed	by	immunohistochemistry	to	visualise	hyaluronan_catabolic_process	-	expressing	cells	.	.
s1793	As	the	first	identified	messenger	RNA	N6-methyladenosine	(	m6A	)	demethylase	,	DNA_dealkylation_involved_in_DNA_repair_has	been	shown	recently	to	play	m6A	-	dependent	roles	in	adipogenesis	and	tumorigenesis	(	especially	in	the	development	of	leukemia	and	glioblastoma	)	.	.
s376	Here	,	we	used	immunohistochemical	staining	to	measure	negative_regulation_of_phosphatase_activity_expression	in	147	samples	from	tumors	and	30	samples	from	the	adjacent	normal	lung	tissues	of	patients	with	non	-	small	cell	lung	cancer	.	.
s2478	Expression	of	cry2	and	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_was	significantly	downregulated	in	tumor_tissue	compared	to	adjacent	tissues	.	.
s3032	Specific	inhibition	of	mitoribosomal	translation	by	doxycycline	,	chloramphenicol	,	or	siRNA	-	mediated	MRPL13	knockdown	decreased	mitochondrial	protein	expression	,	reduced	oxygen	consumption	rate	,	and	increased	protein_depalmitoylation	-	mediated	tumor_cell	invasiveness	in	SNU387	cells	,	which	have	active	mitochondria	.	.
s2366	In	humans	,	mutations	in	the	calcium_ion_transmembrane_transport_gene	encoding	a2d-4	cause	heterogeneous_forms	of	vision	impairment	in	humans	,	the	underlying	pathogenic	mechanisms	of	which	remain	unclear	.	.
s1712	We	report	the	case	of	an	infant	with	a	novel	heterozygous	heart_development_mutation	who	experienced	hypocalcemic	seizures	.	.
s3136	The	purpose	of	the	article	is	to	investigate	the	role	of	isoleucyl	-	tRNA_aminoacylation_in	proliferation	,	apoptosis	,	and	cell	cycle	of	gastric	cancer_(GC	)	cells	in	vitro	.	.
s389	Co	-	mutations	of	ARID1A	,	negative_regulation_of_epidermal_growth_factor	-	activated_receptor_activity_and	MLL2	introduced	by	CRISPR	/	Cas9	significantly	enhance	the	capabilities	of	self	-	renewal	and	tumor	-	initiating	of	BCNSCs	.	.
s188	Besides	,	we	screened	for	all	the	known	genes	related	to	axonal	autosomal_recessive_Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	(	CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2	,	CMT2B1/LMNA	,	CMT2B2/MED25	,	CMT2B5/NEFL	,	ARCMT2F	/	dHMN2B	/	HSPB1	,	CMT2K	/	GDAP1	,	CMT2P	/	LRSAM1	,	CMT2R	/	TRIM2	,	CMT2S	/	IGHMBP2	,	CMT2T	/	HSJ1	,	CMTRID	/	COX6A1	,	ARAN	-	NM	/	HINT	and	GAN	/	GAN	)	,	for	the	genes	related	to	autosomal	recessive	hereditary	spastic	paraplegia	with	thin	corpus	callosum	and	axonal	peripheral	neuropathy	(	SPG7/PGN	,	SPG15/ZFYVE26	,	SPG21/ACP33	,	SPG35/FA2H	,	bile_acid_metabolic_process	/	GBA2	,	SPG55/C12orf65	and	SPG56/CYP2U1	)	,	as	well	as	for	the	causative	gene	of	peripheral	neuropathy	with	or	without	agenesis	of	the	corpus	callosum	(	SLC12A6	)	.	.
s1950	In	humans	,	loss	-	of	-	function	mutations	of	potassium_ion_import_across_plasma_membrane	,	which	encodes	the	inward	-	rectifying	potassium	channel	KIR4.1	,	causes	seizures_and	progressive	neurological	decline	.	.
s1617	With	the	notable	exception	of	WNT10A	(	Tooth	agenesis	,	selective	,	4	,	MIM	#	150400	)	,	the	genotype	-	phenotype	relationships	described	in	the	present	cohort	represent	an	expansion	of	the	clinical	spectrum	associated	with	these	genes	,	TSPEAR	(	Deafness	,	autosomal_recessive_98	,	MIM	#	614861	)	,	LAMB3	(	Amelogenesis	imperfecta	,	type	IA	,	MIM	#	104530	,	Epidermolysis	bullosa	,	junctional	,	MIMs	#	226700	and	#	226650	)	,	and	histone_H2A_monoubiquitination_(Microphthalmia	,	syndromic	2	,	MIM	#	300166	)	.	.
s4078	We	phenotyped	a	large	population	of	typical	individuals	for	schizophrenia	-	spectrum	and	autism	-	spectrum	traits	,	and	genotyped	them	for	the	single	-	nucleotide	polymorphism	rs850807	,	which	is	putatively	functional	and	linked	with	Arp2/3_complex	-	mediated_actin_nucleation_and	NDN	Genetic	variation	in	rs850807	was	strongly	and	exclusively	associated	with	the	ideas	of	reference	subscale	of	the	schizophrenia	spectrum	,	which	is	best	typified	as	paranoia	.	.
s1990	Leptin	(	angiogenesis	)	and	fat	mass	and	obesity	-	associated	(	FTO	)	alleles	are	known	to	influence	body	fat	mass	in	humans	,	potentially	via	effects	on	appetite	.	.
s217	Our	results	indicate	that	ALS5/SPG11/chemical_synaptic_transmission_is	the	causative	gene	of	a	wide	spectrum	of	clinical	features	,	including	autosomal_recessive_axonal	Charcot	-	Marie	-	Tooth	disease	.
s2380	The	goal	of	this	study	was	to	isolate	cancer_stem	-	like	cells	marked	by	high	expression	of	hyaluronan_catabolic_process	,	a	putative	cancer	stem	cell	marker	,	from	primary	oral	squamous	cell	carcinomas	and	identify	distinctive	gene	expression	patterns	in	these	cells	.	.
s1696	Eleven	of	the	43	kindreds	affected	by	sporadic_disease	(	26	%	)	carry	ribosomal_small_subunit_assembly_mutations	,	whereas	12	of	the	13	multiplex	kindreds	(	92	%	)	carry	RPSA	mutations	.	.
s3814	The	aim	of	this	study	was	to	screen	the	visual	system	homeobox	1	(	regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	)	gene	in	Turkish	patients	with	keratoconus_(KC	)	.	.
s766	We	here	review	the	current	knowledge	and	recent	findings	in	the	known	genes	for	isolated	dystonia_TOR1A	,	THAP1	,	and	GNAL	as	well	as	for	the	combined	dystonias	due	to	mutations	in	GCH1	,	cellular_sodium_ion_homeostasis	,	and	SGCE	.	.
s576	Pkm2	deletion	accelerated	tumor_formation	in	medulloblastoma	-	prone	ND2,SmoA1	mice	,	indicating	the	disrupting	programmed_cell_death_releases	CGNPs	from	a	tumor	-	suppressive	effect	.	.
s2349	The	SMR	single	gene	analysis	results	were	further	subjected	to	gene	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_enrichment	analysis	(	GSEA	)	for	identifying	obesity_associated	gene	sets	.	.
s3598	While	overexpression	of	ion_transmembrane_transport-3	is	frequently	observed	in	cancers	,	the	understanding	of	its	role	and	regulation	during	tumorigenesis	remains	incomplete	.	.
s239	In	the	present	study	,	we	analysed	a	Chinese	family	with	autosomal_recessive_biological_process	.	.
s1495	This	study	aims	to	determine	the	association	between	FGF10	(	rs4415084	CAAAAT	)	,	FGFR2	(	rs2981582	CAAAAT	)	and	cellular_response_to_mechanical_stimulus_(rs889312	AAAAAC	)	gene	polymorphisms	and	breast	cancer	,	to	analyse	the	discriminative	ability	of	each	SNP	and	to	test	the	accuracy	of	the	predictive	breast	cancer	risk	model	which	includes	all	SNPs	.	.
s2339	Beyond	CRC	,	gastric	cancer_patients	also	presented	a	high	positive	rate	of	plasma	mprotein_heterooligomerization_(70	%	)	.	.
s1907	Stimulation	of	BxPC-3	,	Panc-1	,	and	MIA	PaCA-2	pancreatic	cancer_cells	with	EGF	,	HGF	,	FGF-1	,	FGF-2	,	FGF-7	,	and	FGF-10	growth	factors	caused	changes	in	the	expression	of	master	genes	regulating	pancreatic	development	(	SOX9	,	HNF3b	,	GATA-4	,	GATA-6	,	and	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	)	.	.
s539	negative_regulation_of_platelet_aggregation_was	reduced	in	primary	breast	tumor	tissues	as	compared	with	their	adjacent	noncancer_tissues	.	.
s1754	Here	,	we	report	that	pyruvate_metabolic_process	-	M	-	dependent	glycerol	phosphate	formation	from	noncarbohydrate	precursors	(	glyceroneogenesis	)	occurs	in	starved	lung	cancer_cells	and	supports	de	novo	glycerophospholipid	synthesis	.	.
s380	Collectively	,	negative_regulation_of_phosphatase_activity_may	suppress	the	invasion	and	metastasis	of	lung	cancer_cells	,	and	it	may	represent	a	promising	therapeutic	target	for	non	-	small	cell	lung	cancer	.
s3578	With	a	feature	selection	algorithm	,	we	selected	a	panel	of	five	urinary	biomarkers	(	FTL	,	Ferritin	light	chain	,	biological_process	,	Mitogen	-	Activated	Protein	Kinase	1	Interacting	Protein	1	Like	,	FGB	,	Fibrinogen	Beta	Chain	,	RAB33B	,	RAB33B	,	Member	RAS	Oncogene	Family	,	RAB15	,	RAB15	,	Member	RAS	Oncogene	Family	)	and	established	a	combinatorial	model	that	can	correctly	classify	the	majority	of	lung	cancer_cases	both	in	the	training	set	(	n=46	)	and	the	test	sets	(	n=14	-	47	per	set	)	with	an	AUC	ranging	from	0.8747	to	0.9853	.	.
s1369	Ellis	-	glycoprotein_biosynthetic_process_Creveld	syndrome	is	an	autosomal	recessive	skeletal	dysplasia	primarily	characterized	by	the	features	such	as	disproportionate	dwarfism	,	short	ribs	,	short_limbs	,	dysplastic	nails	,	cardiovascular	malformations	,	post	-	axial	polydactyly	(	PAP	)	(	bilateral	)	of	hands	and	feet	.	.
s1326	She	manifested	macrocephaly	,	preaxial	polysyndactyly	,	psychomotor	developmental	delay	,	cerebral	cavernous	malformations	,	and	glucose	intolerance	due	to	a	6.2-Mb	deletion	of	7p14.1p12.3	which	included	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	GCK	,	and	CCM2	.	.
s3155	Defects	of	positive_regulation_of_cytosolic_calcium_ion_concentration	,	calcium-	and	integrin	-	binding	protein	2	,	have	been	reported	to	cause	isolated	deafness	,	DFNB48	and	Usher	syndrome	type	-	IJ	,	characterized	by	congenital	profound	deafness	,	balance	defects	and	blindness	.	.
s2364	PPV	of	the	recall	was	13.0	%	and	24.1	%	,	respectively	(	P	=	.0002	)	,	72	of	80	cancers	found	in	the	biological_process+DM	arm	and	with	complete	DBT	imaging	were	positive	at	least	at	one	DBT	-	alone	reading	.	.
s1381	The	contiguous	deletion	of	Wnt_signaling_pathway_and	its	neighbouring	genes	,	MAOA	/	B	and	EFHC2	,	reportedly	leads	to	syndromic	clinical	features	such	as	microcephaly	,	intellectual	disability	,	and	epilepsy	.	.
s2428	In	this	report	we	describe	a	female	child	with	global	developmental	delay	,	microcephaly	and	myoclonic	seizures_harbouring	a	5	Mb	deletion	in	14q12	locus	resulting	in	deletion	of	single	copy	of	brain	specific	genes	FOXG1	,	protein_phosphorylation_and	NOVA1	.	.
s2752	Loss	-	of	-	function	mutations	of	negative_regulation_of_keratinocyte_proliferation_are	associated	with	intellectual_disability_and	microcephaly	with	pontine	and	cerebellar	hypoplasia	(	MICPCH	)	,	especially	in	females	.	.
s2129	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	flagellated_sperm_motility	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s2055	Another	target	of	protein_polyubiquitination-125a	is	Lin28	,	a	pluripotency	factor	that	is	generally	undetectable	in	differentiated	cells	but	is	often	upregulated	/	reactivated	in	tumors	where	it	acts	as	an	oncogenic	factor	promoting	cell	proliferation	and	tumor	progression	.	.
s1834	Further	,	reconstitution	of	cGMP_biosynthetic_process_signaling	through	genetic	or	oral	ligand	replacement	opposes	tumorigenesis	in	mice	.	.
s3595	BACKGROUND	The	aim	of	this	study	was	to	investigate	the	expression	and	silencing	of	the	S100A8	gene	,	which	encodes	the	S100	calcium	-	binding	protein	A8	(	S100A8	)	,	and	apoptosis	and	phosphorylation	of	protein	kinase	B	(	Akt	)	in	tissue	samples	of	endometrial_carcinoma_and	establishment_of_mitotic_spindle_orientation-1A	endometrial	adenocarcinoma	cells	in	vitro	.	.
s857	Metabolic	cutis	laxa	results	from	Menkes	syndrome	,	caused	by	a	defect	in	the	ATPase	copper	transporting	alpha	(	ATP7A	)	gene	,	congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	due	to	mutations	in	subunit	7	of	the	component	of	oligomeric	Golgi	(	COG7)-congenital	disorders	of	glycosylation	(	CDG	)	complex	,	combined	disorder	of	N-	and	O	-	linked	glycosylation	,	due	to	mutations	in	ATPase	H+	transporting	V0	subunit	a2	(	ATP6VOA2	)	gene	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	reductase	1	deficiency	,	pyrroline-5-carboxylate	synthase	deficiency	,	macrocephaly	,	alopecia	,	cutis	laxa	,	and	scoliosis	(	MACS	)	syndrome	,	due	to	Ras	and	Rab	interactor	2	(	RIN2	)	mutations	,	transaldolase	deficiency	caused	by	mutations	in	the	transaldolase	1	(	TALDO1	)	gene	,	Gerodermia	osteodysplastica	due	to	mutations	in	the	golgin	,	RAB6-interacting	(	GORAB	or	SCYL1BP1	)	gene	,	and	mitogen	-	activated	pathway	(	MAP	)	kinase	defects	,	caused	by	mutations	in	several	genes	[	protein	tyrosine	phosphatase	,	non	-	receptor	-	type	11	(	PTPN11	)	,	RAF	,	NF	,	HRas	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	HRAS	)	,	B	-	Raf	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	BRAF	)	,	MEK1/2	,	KRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	KRAS	)	,	SOS	Ras	/	G_protein	-	coupled_receptor_signaling_pathway_guanine	nucleotide	exchange	factor	2	(	SOS2	)	,	leucine	rich	repeat	scaffold	protein	(	SHOC2	)	,	NRAS	proto	-	oncogene	,	GTPase	(	NRAS	)	,	and	Raf-1	proto	-	oncogene	,	serine	/	threonine	kinase	(	RAF1	)	]	,	which	regulate	the	Ras	-	MAPK	cascade	.	.
s456	The	individuals	with	PARS2	and	asparaginyl	-	tRNA_aminoacylation_mutations	,	we	have	reported	here	demonstrate	similar	neurological	features	as	those	previously	reported	,	with	diversity	in	clinical	presentation	such	as	hearing	loss	and	seizure_type	.	.
