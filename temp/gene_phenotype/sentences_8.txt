s514	These	positive_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated	-	mediated	effects	were	modulated	by	the	protein	kinase	B	(	AKT	)	signaling	pathway	,	and	inhibition	of	AKT	signaling	attenuated	AF1q	-	induced	tumor_promotion	.	.
s2466	Moreover	,	we	show	that	most	SCLC	tumors	can	be	classified	into	one	of	three	lineages	based	on	the	expression	of	POU2F3	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	or	NEUROD1	.	.
s2865	We	present	a	case	of	type	2	autosomal	recessive	AOS	associated	with	heterozygous	mutations	in	the	dedicator	of	cytokinesis	6	(	blood_coagulation	)	gene	,	with	characteristic	findings	of	ACC	,	TTLD	,	intracerebral_periventricular_calcifications	,	and	polymicrogyria	.
s2567	Finally	,	the	simultaneous	increase	of	CPT1A	,	CACT	and	carnitine_metabolic_process,_CoA	-	linked_is	fundamental	for	PCCs	to	sustain	FA	oxidation	in	the	presence	of	heavy	lipid	load	on	prostate	cancer_mitochondria	.	.
s225	Thus	,	mutated	tRNA_aminoacylation_aggravates	mitochondrial	dysfunctions	associated	with	the	m.11778GAAAAA	mutation	,	exceeding	the	threshold	for	the	expression	of	blindness_phenotype	.	.
s2066	This	review	summarizes	the	current	knowledge	of	tumorigenesis	and	tumor	progression	in	early	lung_adenocarcinoma	,	with	special	focus	on	its	clinicopathological	characteristics	and	their	associations	with	driver	mutations	(	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	,	KRAS	,	and	BRAF	)	as	well	as	on	its	molecular	pathogenesis	and	progression	.
s1991	DHEA	prevents	mitochondrial_dysfunction_by	decreasing	the	activation	of	mitochondrial_fission_and	MFF	,	and	increasing	MFN1	expression	.	.
s2183	Ginsenomelanosome_organizationde	(	Rg1	)	is	a	traditional	Chinese	herb	that	is	widely	acknowledged	due	to	its	anti	-	tumor_characteristics	.	.
s1724	protein_polyubiquitination-142	-	3p	overexpression	resulted	in	a	strong	decline	in	breast	cancer_stem	cell	characteristics	with	a	decrease	in	CD44	,	CD133	,	ALDH1	,	Bod1	,	BRCA2	,	and	mammosphere	formation	as	well	as	reduced	survival	after	irradiation	.	.
s1258	Collectively	,	our	data	highlight	that	,	by	inhibiting	ANT1	and	mitochondrial_dysfunction	,	SHP2	orchestrates	an	intrinsic	regulatory	loop	to	limit	excessive	negative_regulation_of_NF	-	kappaB_transcription_factor_activity_inflammasome	activation	.
s963	In	an	additional	affected	individual	with	RHD	and	a	congenital_heart_defect	,	we	found	a	homozygous	loss	-	of	-	function	(	LOF	)	variant	in	SLIT3	,	recapitulating	phenotypes	reported	with	axon_guidance_inactivation	in	the	mouse	.	.
s2137	Some	genes	,	such	as	GSTM1	,	DNMT3L	,	and	CYP1A1	,	have	been	shown	to	be	potentially	associated	with	oligospermia	,	some	,	such	as	CATSPER1	,	CRISP2	,	SEPT4	,	TCTE3	,	flagellated_sperm_motility	,	and	DNAH1	,	with	asthenospermia	,	and	still	others	,	such	as	DPY19L2	and	AURKC	,	with	teratospermia	.	.
s1452	Somatic	mutations	in	four	genes	(	KCNJ5	,	ATP1A1	,	regulation_of_cytosolic_calcium_ion_concentration_and	CACNA1D	)	,	differently	implicated	in	intracellular	ion	homeostasis	,	have	been	identified	in	nearly	60	%	of	the	sporadic_APAs	.	.
s1644	cell_adhesion_has	multiple	properties	,	including	tumour_suppressor	activity	.	.
s1471	In	the	present	study	,	the	results	obtained	from	our	previously	published	methylation	array	were	analyzed	and	10	candidate	genes	involved	in	DNA	repair	[	protein	phosphatase	4	catalytic	subunit	(	PPP4C	)	]	,	apoptosis	[	runt	related	transcription	factor	3	(	RUNX3	)	,	interferon	regulatory	factor	4	(	IRF4	)	,	ubiquitin	C	-	terminal	hydrolase	L1	(	UCHL1	)	and	tumor_protein	p53	inducible	protein	3	(	TP53I3	)	]	,	cell	proliferation	[	cyclin	D2	(	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation	)	and	Ras	association	domain	family	member	1	(	RASSF1	)	]	,	drug	metabolism	[	aldehyde	dehydrogenase	1	family	member	A3	(	ALDH1A3	)	and	solute	carrier	family	29	member	1	(	SLC29A1	)	]	and	angiogenesis	[	human	immunodeficiency	virus-1	tat	interactive	protein	2	(	HTATIP2	)	]	were	selected	for	quantification	of	their	methylation	levels	in	54	CCA	and	19	adjacent	normal	tissues	using	methylation	-	sensitive	high	-	resolution	melting	.	.
s2252	Collectively	,	our	findings	indicate	that	up	-	regulated	mRNA	expression	of	protein_polyubiquitination	,	RBCK1	and	SHARPIN	could	potentially	be	diagnostic	biomarkers	of	breast	cancer_and	RNF31	might	be	a	drug	target	for	ERalpha	-	negative	breast	cancers	.
s2100	In	addition	,	the	coexistence	of	high	MACC1	and	low	NM23-negative_regulation_of_cell_migration_expression	and	tumor_budding	was	associated	with	short	OS	(	p	AAAA	0.001	)	.	.
s3972	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	positive_regulation_of_cytokinesis	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s382	Collectively	,	these	findings	demonstrate	that	mutations	in	DNAJC21	cause	a	cancer	-	prone	negative_regulation_of_autophagy_syndrome	due	to	corruption	of	early	nuclear	rRNA	biogenesis	and	late	cytoplasmic	maturation	of	the	60S	subunit	.
s4025	These	findings	support	that	UNC119	is	a	regulator	of	the	RASSF6-negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	-	p53	axis	and	functions	as	a	tumor_suppressor	.
s3771	We	identified	30	new	blood	pressure-	or	hypertension	-	associated	genetic	regions	in	the	general	population	,	including	3	rare	missense	variants	in	RBM47	,	COL21A1	and	leukocyte_differentiation_with	larger	effects	(	AAAA1.5	mm	Hg	/	allele	)	than	common	variants	.	.
s56	The	created	databases	include	ACAD8	(	isobutyryl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	deficiency	(	IBD	)	)	,	branched	-	chain_amino_acid_catabolic_process_(short	-	chain	acyl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	(	SCAD	)	deficiency	)	,	AUH	(	3-methylglutaconic	aciduria	(	3-MGCA	)	)	,	DHCR7	(	Smith	-	Lemli	-	Opitz	syndrome	)	,	HMGCS2	(	3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl	-	CoA	synthase	2	deficiency	)	,	HSD17B10	(	17-beta	-	hydroxysteroid	dehydrogenase	X	deficiency	)	,	FKBP14	(	Ehlers	-	Danlos	syndrome	with	progressive	kyphoscoliosis	,	myopathy	,	and	hearing	loss	,	EDSKMH	)	and	ROGDI	(	Kohlschutter	-	Tonz	syndrome	)	.	.
s59	The	created	databases	include	ACAD8	(	isobutyryl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	deficiency	(	IBD	)	)	,	ACADSB	(	short	-	chain	acyl	-	CoA	dehydrogenase	(	SCAD	)	deficiency	)	,	AUH	(	3-methylglutaconic	aciduria	(	3-MGCA	)	)	,	DHCR7	(	Smith	-	Lemli	-	Opitz	syndrome	)	,	acetyl	-	CoA_metabolic_process_(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl	-	CoA	synthase	2	deficiency	)	,	HSD17B10	(	17-beta	-	hydroxysteroid	dehydrogenase	X	deficiency	)	,	FKBP14	(	Ehlers	-	Danlos	syndrome	with	progressive	kyphoscoliosis	,	myopathy	,	and	hearing	loss	,	EDSKMH	)	and	ROGDI	(	Kohlschutter	-	Tonz	syndrome	)	.	.
s1867	The	level	of	gene	expression	of	activation_of_NF	-	kappaB	-	inducing_kinase_activity	,	NF	-	kB	,	tumor_necrosis	factor	-	a	(	TNF	-	a	)	,	and	interleukin-6	(	IL-6	)	was	measured	by	RT	-	PCR	,	and	TNF	-	a	,	IL-6	levels	in	the	cell	supernatant	were	determined	by	ELISA	.	.
s1356	To	further	elucidate	the	molecular	pathophysiology	of	schizophrenia	,	we	have	evaluated	the	genetic	association	of	rRNA_processing_and	ALG1	in	schizophrenia	.	.
s1739	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	SPRR1A	,	KRT78	,	nucleobase	-	containing_compound_metabolic_process	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s149	Three	patients	presented	with	cognitive	impairment	,	reinforcing	the	association	between	the	disrupted	genes	(	cell_surface_receptor_signaling_pathway	-	MRX58	,	KIAA2022-MRX98	,	and	IL1RAPL1-MRX21/34	)	and	intellectual_disability	.	.
s3263	However	,	in	HaCaT	and	HEK293	T	cells	that	display	transformed	phenotypes	,	but	do	not	originate	from	patient	-	derived	tumors	,	the	ER	stress	-	inducing	treatments	resulted	in	an	upregulation	of	FAM129A	and	HKDC1	,	but	not	aging_transcripts	,	By	a	luciferase	reporter	approach	we	identified	a	highly	active	ATF4-responsive	element	within	the	upstream	region	of	the	KRT16	gene	.	.
s2433	In	conclusion	,	novel	data	on	regulation_of_autophagy-1	overexpression	in	HGG	are	presented	suggesting	involvement	of	this	gene	and	protein	in	cell	adhesion	and	tumor_progression	.	.
s2108	Analysis	of	specific	DKD	phenotypes	identified	a	novel	signal	near	signal_transduction_(rs9942471	,	P	=	4.5	x	10	-	8	)	associated	with	microalbuminuria_in	European	T2D	case	subjects	.	.
s2510	Moreover	,	comparison	of	the	porcine	results	to	those	reported	by	human	melanoma_GWAS	indicated	shared	association	signals	notably	at	CDKAL1	and	TERT	loci	but	also	nearby	CCND1	,	FTO	,	antibacterial_humoral_response_and	TMEM38B	-	RAD23B	loci	.	.
s1859	Here	,	genome	-	wide	quantitative	functional	profiling	,	DDR	measurements	and	genetic	interaction	assays	in	Schizosaccharomyces	pombe	reveal	a	chromate	toxicogenomic	profile	that	closely	resembles	the	cancer_chemotherapeutic	drug	camptothecin	(	CPT	)	,	which	traps	Topoisomerase	1	(	DNA_topological_change)-DNA	covalent	complex	(	Top1cc	)	at	the	3	_	end	of	single	-	stand	breaks	(	SSBs	)	,	resulting	in	replication	fork	collapse	.	.
s311	Here	we	report	six	affected	individuals	from	four	families	with	intellectual_disability_(ID	)	and	neurological	and	other	congenital	abnormalities	associated	with	compound	heterozygous	variants	in	regulation_of_TOR_signaling	.	.
s782	Inhibiting	naive	CD4	+	T	cell	recruitment	into	tumors	by	interfering	with	ER_to_Golgi_vesicle	-	mediated_transport_recognition	of	CCL18	may	be	an	attractive	strategy	for	anticancer_immunotherapy	.
s2448	These	findings	support	that	lipoprotein_transport_is	a	regulator	of	the	RASSF6-MDM2-p53	axis	and	functions	as	a	tumor_suppressor	.
s1577	By	combining	meta	-	analysis	results	and	identification	of	two	unrelated	HCM	patients	with	homozygous	cardiac_muscle_hypertrophy_truncating	variants	,	we	suggest	that	the	association	of	CSRP3	as	a	validated	HCM	-	causing	gene	require	additional	studies	and	those	CSRP3	variants	could	result	in	HCM	with	an	autosomal	recessive	inheritance_rather	than	with	an	autosomal	dominant	transmission	as	usually	reported	on	HCM	(	OMIM	612124	)	.
s95	We	confirmed	it	in	MCF7	,	MDA	-	MB-436	and	two	human	primary	breast	cancer_cells	by	showing	reduced	thiamine	levels	upon	a	knock	-	down	of	protein_polyubiquitination-155	.	.
s3212	From	the	integrative	analysis	of	the	transcriptome	and	clinicopathologic	data	of	human	multi	-	stage	HCC	tissues	,	we	were	able	to	identify	barrier	-	to	-	autointegration	factor	1	(	BANF1	)	,	procollagen	-	lysine	,	2-oxoglutarate	5-dioxygenase	3	(	PLOD3	)	and	splicing	factor	3b	subunit	4	(	SF3B4	)	as	early	HCC	biomarkers	which	could	be	detected	in	precancerous	lesions	of	HCC	,	with	superior	capabilities	to	diagnose	eHCC	compared	to	the	currently	popular	HCC	diagnostic	biomarkers	,	regulation_of_canonical_Wnt_signaling_pathway	,	GS	,	and	HSP70	.	.
s2822	We	investigated	the	diagnostic	and	prognostic	capability	of	COL4A1	and	cell	-	matrix_adhesion_in	voided	urine	and	compared	the	observed	values	with	those	of	fragments	of	cytokeratin-19	(	CYFRA21	-	1	)	,	nuclear	matrix	protein	22	(	NMP-22	)	,	and	voided	urine	cytology	in	bladder	cancer_(BCa	)	.	.
s2646	Array	methylation	-	based	analysis	uncovered	a	somatic	epigenetic	mutation	in	mitochondrial_electron_transport,_succinate_to_ubiquinone_in	a	patient	with	multiple	pheochromocytomas	and	a	gastrointestinal	stromal	tumor	.	.
s1599	Consistent	with	this	result	,	mutations	in	the	learning_gene	coding	for	CASPR2	in	human	have	been	identified	in	neurodevelopmental	disorders	such	as	autism	,	intellectual	disability	,	and	epilepsy	.	.
s2589	Genetic	studies	on	consanguineous	families	with	primary	microcephaly_have	identified	15	(	MCPH	)	causative	genes	that	include	MCPH1	,	WDR62	,	CDK5RAP2	,	CASC5	,	ASPM	,	CENPJ	,	STIL	,	CEP135	,	CEP152	,	brain_development	,	PHC1	,	CDK6	,	CENPE	,	SASS6	MFSD2A	ANKLE2	and	CIT	(	Khan	et	al	.	2014	,	Yamamoto	et	al	.	2014	,	Alakbarzade	et	al	.	2015,Morris	-	Rosendahl	and	Kaindl	2015	,	Basit	et	al	.	2016	)	.	.
s835	Methods	of	diagnosing	malignant	pheochromocytoma	(	PCC	)	or	paraganglioma_(tricarboxylic_acid_cycle	)	are	needed	.	.
s2809	Other	EXOSC3	mutations	and	EXOSC8	cases	are	intermediate	;	spliceosomal_snRNP_assembly_type	1-like	presentation	,	spasticity_(mostly	in	EXOSC8	)	and	death	between	3	months	and	5	years	.	.
s1964	Leucine	-	rich	glioma	-	inactivated	protein	1	(	axon_guidance	)	is	a	secreted	neuronal	protein	and	a	Nogo	receptor	1	(	NgR1	)	ligand	.	.
s2548	To	identify	the	genes	that	are	targets	of	constitutive	PI3K	/	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_signalling	in	lung	cancer_cells	,	we	performed	a	comparative	transcriptomic	analysis	of	human	lung	epithelial	cells	(	BEAS-2B	)	expressing	active	mutant	AKT1	(	AKT1-E17	K	)	,	active	mutant	PIK3CA	(	PIK3CA	-	E545	K	)	or	that	are	silenced	for	PTEN	.	.
s233	Somatic	mutations	in	four	genes	(	KCNJ5	,	ATP1A1	,	regulation_of_cytosolic_calcium_ion_concentration_and	CACNA1D	)	,	differently	implicated	in	intracellular	ion	homeostasis	,	have	been	identified	in	nearly	60	%	of	the	sporadic_APAs	.	.
s296	Bardet	Biedl	syndrome	(	visual_perception	)	is	a	multisystem	genetically	heterogeneous_ciliopathy	that	most	commonly	leads	to	obesity	,	photoreceptor	degeneration	,	digit	anomalies	,	genito	-	urinary	abnormalities	,	as	well	as	cognitive	impairment	with	autism	,	among	other	features	.	.
s1354	These	results	demonstrate	a	previously	unrecognized	relationship	between	DNA_strand_renaturation_and	REV3L	in	cancer_cell	metabolism	and	may	lead	to	improvements	in	chemotherapy	treatment	plans	that	reduce	cisplatin	resistance	in	lung	cancer	.
s2266	The	positive_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II_gene	plays	a	critical	role	as	an	oncogene	in	diverse	tumors	.	.
s2168	Genomics	of	tumors	identified	several	new	genes	;	including	ZNRF3	in	adrenocortical	carcinomas	,	mRNA_processing_in	cortisol	-	producing	adrenal	adenomas	,	ARMC5	in	primary	macronodular	adrenal_hyperplasia_and	USP8	in	pituitary	corticotroph	adenomas	.	.
s2563	Here	,	we	report	that	in	prostate	cancer_cells	(	PCCs	)	microRNAs	(	protein_polyubiquitinationNAs	)	greatly	contribute	to	deregulation	of	mitochondrial	fatty	acid	(	FA	)	oxidation	via	carnitine	system	modulation	.	.
s595	Our	findings	are	both	important	for	the	differential	diagnosis	of	patients	with	urea	cycle	disorders	and	also	broaden	the	differential	diagnosis	of	hyperammonemia_associated	with	3-methylglutaconic	aciduria	,	which	was	earlier	only	reported	in	TMEM70	and	intracellular_cholesterol_transport_defect	.
s2094	The	aims	of	the	present	study	were	to	evaluate	the	relation	of	dysregulated	MACC1	,	c	-	MET	,	and	NM23-negative_regulation_of_cell_migration_expression	with	the	histopathological	features	of	tumors	in	recurrence	formation	in	eCC	cases	.	.
s1524	Finally	,	twenty	-	four	important	hub	genes	(	RASGRP2	,	IKZF1	,	CXCR5	,	LTB	,	BLK	,	LINGO3	,	CCR6	,	P2RY10	,	RHOH	,	JUP	,	KRT14	,	PLA2G3	,	peptide_cross	-	linking	,	KRT78	,	SFN	,	CLDN4	,	IL1RN	,	PKP3	,	CBLC	,	KRT16	,	TMEM79	,	KLK8	,	LYPD3	and	LYPD5	)	were	treated	as	valuable	factors	involved	in	the	immune	response	and	tumor_cell	development	in	tumorigenesis	.	.
s3921	To	evaluate	whether	germline	variants	in	genes	encoding	pancreatic	secretory	enzymes	contribute	to	pancreatic	cancer_susceptibility	,	we	sequenced	the	coding	regions	of	CPB1	and	other	genes	encoding	pancreatic	secretory	enzymes	and	known	pancreatitis	susceptibility	genes	(	PRSS1	,	CPA1	,	CTRC	,	and	negative_regulation_of_nitric_oxide_mediated_signal_transduction	)	in	a	hospital	series	of	pancreatic	cancer	cases	and	controls	.	.
s2079	Four	of	the	five	genes	,	including	AKAP12	,	SOPB	,	TCF7L2	,	endodermal_cell_differentiation_and	TXNIP	were	downregulated	,	and	were	associated	with	the	OS	of	patients	with	breast	carcinoma	.	.
s2434	To	study	the	effect	and	related	mechanism	of	IL-21	alone	and	in	combination	with	5-Fluorouracil	on	the	proliferation	and	growth	,	transferability	,	and	apoptosis	of	gastric	cancer_cells	,	we	cultivated	gastric	cancer	cell	muscle_organ_development-7901	and	created	four	experimental	groups	with	varying	concentrations	of	IL-21	and	5-Fluorouracil	,	IL-21	group	(	IL-21	100ng	/	ml	)	,	semi	-	combination	group	(	5-Fluorouracil	25ug	/	ml+IL-21	100ng	/	ml	)	,	5-Fluorouracil	group	(	5-Fluorouracil	50ug	/	ml	)	,	and	combination	group	(	5-Fluorouracil	50ug	/	ml+IL-21	100ng	/	ml	)	.	.
s2624	Meesmann	epithelial	corneal_dystrophy_(MECD	)	is	a	rare	autosomal	dominant	disorder	caused	by	dominant	-	negative	mutations	within	the	intermediate_filament_cytoskeleton_organization_or	KRT12	genes	,	which	encode	the	cytoskeletal	protein	keratins	K3	and	K12	,	respectively	.	.
s3725	The	PCH1sub	-	types	with	early	death	(	between	ages	1	day	and	17	months	)	,	seen	in	patients	with	p	.	G31A	/	EXOSC3	or	SLC25A46	mutations	have	a	spliceosomal_snRNP_assembly_type	1-like	clinical	presentation	but	with	global	developmental_delay	,	visual	and	hearing	impairment	,	with	or	without	microcephaly	,	nystagmus	and	optic	atrophy	.	.
s549	Recent	GWAS	completed	for	three	types	of	common	adult	-	onset	glaucoma_have	identified	novel	loci	for	POAG	(	primary	-	open	-	angle	glaucoma	)	(	lysosome_organization	,	AFAP1	,	GMDS	,	PMM2	,	TGFBR3	,	FNDC3B	,	ARHGEF12	,	GAS7	,	FOXC1	,	ATXN2	,	TXNRD2	)	,	PACG	(	primary	angle	-	closure	glaucoma	(	EPDR1	,	CHAT	,	GLIS3	,	FERMT2	,	DPM2-FAM102	)	,	and	exfoliation	syndrome	(	XFS	)	glaucoma	(	CACNA1A	)	.	.
s658	We	also	found	that	targeting	of	heterotypic_cell	-	cell_adhesion_by	RNAi	or	blocking	mAbs	impaired	laminin	-	induced	signaling	,	and	it	led	to	a	significant	delay	in	tumor_engraftment	plus	a	strong	reduction	in	tumor	size	and	invasion	.	.
s2739	In	addition	,	4/18	(	18	%	)	of	intraductal	tubulopapillary	neoplasms	had	FGFR2	fusions	(	FGFR2-CEP55	,	FGFR2-SASS6	,	DISP1-FGFR2	,	FGFR2-TXLNA	,	and	FGFR2-VCL	)	and	1/18	(	5.5	%	)	had	STRN	-	phosphorylation_fusion	.	.
s3588	Furthermore	,	in	cultured	human	BMSCs	,	TGF	-	a	stimulated	production	of	procancer_cytokines	including	IL-6	,	VEGF	,	FGF10	,	MAPK_cascade	,	and	TGF	-	b1	in	a	dose	-	dependent	manner	.	.
s1120	We	expand	the	knowledge	about	TTC7A	deficiency	,	describing	a	patient	with	the	mild	phenotype	of	TTC7A	deficiency	but	presenting	overlapping	features	of	negative_regulation_of_protein_export_from_nucleus	/	THE	and	MIA	-	CID	,	intestinal	atresia	and	inflammatory	bowel	disease	evocative	of	MIA	-	CID	,	but	also	dental	abnormalities	,	huge	forehead	,	liver	abnormalities	,	autoimmune	thyroiditis	and	hypogammaglobulinemia	,	evocative	of	SD	/	THE	.
s2451	Methods	,	Fourteen	haplotype	-	tagging	single	nucleotide	polymorphisms	(	htSNPs	)	of	mismatch_repair	,	MLH3	and	MSH2	genes	were	genotyped	by	Sequenom	MassARRAY	method	in	146	patients	with	locally	advanced	rectal	cancer_who	received	preoperative	chemoradiotherapy	.	.
s1566	We	conducted	a	case	-	control	study	within	the	Hispanic	Community	Health	Study	/	Study	of	Latinos	to	investigate	whether	sleep	disordered	breathing	,	as	a	model	of	hypoxemia	,	is	independently	associated	with	elevated	cregulation_of_phosphate_transport_levels	in	the	general	population	and	with	elevated	cFGF23	and	iFGF23	levels	in	patients	with	chronic	kidney	disease	(	CKD	)	,	in	whom	FGF23	cleavage	may	be	impaired	.	.
s3497	The	tumor_number	and	weight	in	the	JTE-013	group	were	melanosome_organizationgnificantly	less	than	those	in	the	control	group	(	all	PAAAA0.01	)	.	.
s2104	We	suggest	that	the	combination	of	reduced	positive_regulation_of_DNA_binding	-	H1	,	induced	MACC1	,	and	the	presence	of	tumor	budding	are	promising	biomarkers	for	the	prediction	of	recurrence	and	may	aid	the	stratification	of	patients	with	stage	II	colon	cancer_for	adjuvant	chemotherapy	.
s1259	We	performed	permutation	-	based	analysis	to	test	for	overall	enrichment	of	these	510	genes	carrying	these	548	variants	with	genes	mutated	in	Kallmann	syndrome	and	with	a	control	negative_regulation_of_transcription,_DNA	-	templated_of	genes	mutated	in	hypogonadotrophic	hypogonadism_without	anosmia	.	.
s4049	Five	genes	,	including	OTOGL	,	PLCB4	,	SCEL	,	THSD4	,	and	WWOX	,	have	CNVs	in	the	six	patients	with	sporadic_HBs	,	and	three	genes	,	including	lipid_transport	,	CWC27	,	and	LAMA2	,	have	CNVs	in	the	five	patients	with	familial	HBs	.	.
s1612	We	hypothesized	that	mechanisms	underlying	chemical	-	induced	phosphatidylinositol_phosphorylation_can	be	characterized	by	evaluating	the	mutational	spectra	of	these	tumors	.	.
s2629	In	the	present	study	,	a	differential	cytotoxicity	screen	of	hormone	-	resistant	prostate	cancer_LNCaP	-	histone_H3-K9_demethylation_cells	and	the	parental	LNCaP	-	FGC	cells	against	normal	MRC5	fibroblast	cells	,	identified	a	small	molecule	compound	,	Aristeromycin	(	a	derivative	of	3-deazaneplanocin	A	(	DZNeP	)	)	.	.
s3291	In	the	present	study	,	we	demonstrated	that	negative_regulation_of_kinase_activity_was	dramatically	downregulated	in	breast	cancer_compared	with	normal	tissues	by	using	real	-	time	quantitative	polymerase	chain	reaction	,	western	blot	and	two	public	data	portals	,	The	Cancer	Genome	Atlas	(	TCGA	)	and	Oncomine	datasets	.	.
s2612	We	characterize	myoblast_fusion	-	CFZS	as	a	congenital	myopathy	with	marked	facial_weakness_and	additional	clinical	and	pathologic	features	that	distinguish	it	from	other	congenital	neuromuscular	syndromes	.	.
s3485	Overall	,	our	findings	identify	camera	-	type_eye_development_as	a	potential	therapeutic	target	for	modulating	ocular	growth	aimed	at	preventing	or	slowing	down	myopia	,	which	is	reaching	epidemic	proportions	.
s910	Immunoperoxidase	levels	in	the	tumor_were	positive	for	factor	VIII	and	CD31	and	negative	for	S100	,	protein	Melan	-	A	,	CD34	,	synaptophysin	,	chromogranin	,	desmin	,	muscle	specific	actin	,	ETFA	(	EMA	)	,	KRT20	(	CK20	)	,	negative_regulation_of_transcription_by_RNA_polymerase_II	,	TTF1	,	LNPEP	(	PLAP	)	,	inhibin	,	?	-fetoprotein	,	CD30	,	hepatocyte	paraffin	,	and	aberrant	expression	of	cytokeratin	7	and	pankeratin	.	.
s913	We	report	here	that	t	-	butyl	alcohol	,	which	is	neither	a	substrate	nor	an	inhibitor	of	alcohol	dehydrogenases	or	Cyp2E1	,	is	a	potent	inducer	of	holoprosencephaly_in	cell_adhesion_mutant	mice	.	.
s510	Our	results	therefore	confirm	the	KCNC3R423H	allele	as	causative	for	SCA13	,	through	a	dominant	negative	effect	on	KCNC3WT	and	links	with	positive_regulation_of_protein_phosphorylation_that	account	for	dominant	inheritance	,	congenital	onset	,	and	disease	pathology	.
s3480	These	findings	may	provide	a	better	understanding	about	the	mechanism	of	breast	cancer_and	suggest	that	definitive_hemopoiesis_may	be	a	potential	prognostic	biomarker	and	therapeutic	target	for	breast	cancer	,	especially	for	bone	metastasis	of	breast	cancer	.
s3385	Prolyl	endopeptidase	-	like	(	regulation_of_synaptic_vesicle_exocytosis	)	deficiency	(	MIM	#	616224	)	is	a	rare	autosomal_recessive_inherited	congenital	myasthenic	syndrome	characterized	by	neonatal	hypotonia	,	feeding	problems	,	mild	dysmorphism	,	and	neuromuscular	symptoms	,	followed	by	hyperphagia	and	obesity	in	later	childhood	.	.
s1868	The	level	of	gene	expression	of	IRAK1	,	peripheral_nervous_system_development	-	kB	,	tumor_necrosis	factor	-	a	(	TNF	-	a	)	,	and	interleukin-6	(	IL-6	)	was	measured	by	RT	-	PCR	,	and	TNF	-	a	,	IL-6	levels	in	the	cell	supernatant	were	determined	by	ELISA	.	.
s2787	We	previously	described	a	relatively	pure	hereditary	spastic_paraplegia_(HSP	)	phenotype	associated	with	mutations	in	positive_regulation_of_mitochondrial_fission	.	.
